       The allocation of responsibility for administration of the forest practices regulations in coastal management consistency determinations is sufficiently unclear that it seems appropriate for resolution by the adoption of regulations since differing policy considerations emphasized in the Forest Practices Act, the Coastal Management Act, and proposed permit reform regulations will be served to a greater or lesser extent by assigning responsibility for interpreting and applying the forest practices regulations to more than one agency and since a particular result is not compelled under the various pieces of authorizing legislation.

      </p>
      <p>
       The adoption of forest practices regulations by the Department of Natural Resources in 11 AAC 95 has completely preempted the coastal policy council’s regulations,
   6 AAC 80.100, in regulating timber harvest and processing in the coastal area. April 20, 1981 Op. Att’y Gen.

       The allocation of responsibility for administration of the forest practices regulations in coastal management consistency determinations is sufficiently unclear that it seems appropriate for resolution by the adoption of regulations. Differing policy considerations emphasized in the Forest Practices Act, the Coastal Management Act, and proposed permit reform regulations will be served to a greater or lesser extent by assigning responsibility for interpreting and applying the forest practices regulations to more than one agency. This is especially so as no particular result is compelled under the various pieces of authorizing legislation.

The state forester shall conduct the field inspection within 21 days after the date that the site will be accessible and available unless the operator otherwise agrees, and the operator may begin operations at the conclusion of the 21-day period unless the state forester has issued a stop work order under AS 41.17.138.

       Non-monetary asset transfers are not appropriations subject to the governor’s enhanced veto under Alaska Const., art. II. Therefore, a 2000 amendment (ch. 136, SLA 2000) allowing the University of Alaska to select between 250,000 and 260,000 acres of state lands which would then be conveyed to the university to manage was not an appropriation, and an override of the governor’s veto required only a two-thirds majority in the legislature, not the three-fourths majority required for the overriding of a veto of an appropriations bill. Having received the required two-thirds majority, the veto was successfully overridden, and the bill affecting this section became law. State Legislative Council v.

       The provisions of Title 38 regarding acquisition, management, and disposal of state land do not apply to land withdrawn from the state public domain as a state park or recreation area. Title 38 does apply to state forests, except that land in a state forest may not be conveyed to a third party and is subject to limitations on other types of state land disposals.

       The commissioner shall prepare a forest management plan consistent with AS 38.04.005 and this chapter for each state forest and for each unit of a state forest to assist in meeting the requirements of this chapter. An operational level forest inventory shall be completed before a forest management plan for the state forest or the unit of a state forest is adopted. The forest management plan shall be adopted, implemented, and maintained within three years of the establishment of a state forest by the legislature. To the extent they are found to be compatible with the primary purpose of state forests under AS 41.17.200, the forest management plan must consider and permit uses of forest land for nontimber purposes, including recreation, tourism, mining, mineral exploration, mineral leasing, material extraction, consumptive and nonconsumptive uses of wildlife and fish, grazing and other agricultural activities, and other traditional uses. If the commissioner finds that a permitted use is incompatible with one or more other uses in a portion of a state forest, the commissioner shall affirmatively state in the management plan that finding of incompatibility for the specific area where the incompatibility is anticipated to exist and the time period when the incompatibility is anticipated to exist together with the reasons and benefits for each finding.

       The “sustained yield principle”
   
   as used in Alas. Const. art. VIII, § 4 accords with the definition set forth in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.38.html#t38c04a05s38.04.910" target="_blank">38.04.910</a></cite>(12), and the added language in the definition of “sustained yield” in this section that it “does not require that timber be harvested in a nondeclining yield basis over a rotation period”; it should be read as permitting timber cutting at a level that cannot be sustained over a forest rotation period only in unusual circumstances.

       Formerly AS 41.20.020. Renumbered in 1983. Paragraph (a)(13) was enacted as (a)(12) and renumbered in 1981. The present second sentence of AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t41c21a04s41.21.490" target="_self">41.21.490</a></cite> was enacted as a part of (a)(13) and transferred in 1981, with minor word changes in (a)(13) of this section. In 1984, “a compatible use” was substituted for “compatible” in subsection (b) to correct a manifest error in ch. 16, SLA 1984.

        Inclusion of university lands in park without compensation. —

       Although the inclusion of university lands in Chugach State Park by statute, without compensation to the university, was a breach of the federal trust, invalidating that portion of this section which included the university land in the park was error; the proper remedy is to permit an award in inverse condemnation.

      The presently state-owned land and water, and all that acquired in the future by the state, lying within the parcels described in this section are designated as the Chugach State Park.
   The park is established to protect and supply a satisfactory water supply for the use of the people, to provide recreational opportunities for the people by providing areas for specified uses and constructing the necessary facilities in those areas, to protect areas of unique and exceptional scenic value, to provide areas for the public display of local wildlife, and to protect the existing wilderness characteristics of the easterly interior area.
   The eastern area of the park shall be operated as a wilderness area, the central area as a scenic area, and the periphery areas as recreational areas.
   The land and water designated as the Chugach State Park and reserved from all uses incompatible with its primary function as a state park is that within the following described parcels excluding valid entries:

       Inclusion of the University of Alaska lands in Chugach State Park without paying compensation to the university violated the trust provision of the federal grant. State v. University of Alaska, 624 P.2d 807 (Alaska 1981).

      <p>
       The objective that park lands are to be managed in a way that will increase “the value of a recreational experience” is incompatible with the objective of using university land for the “exclusive use and benefit” of the University of Alaska, since the implied intent of the grant was to maximize the economic return from the land for the benefit of the university and this intent cannot be accomplished if the use of the land is restricted to any significant degree.

The primary purposes of establishing the Afognak Island State Park are to protect the area’s recreational and scenic resources; to protect the area’s fish and wildlife habitat; to preserve and enhance the continued use of the area for sport and subsistence hunting and fishing, personal use fishing, trapping, recreational activities, and commercial fishing; and to restore and enhance resources and services injured by the Exxon Valdez oil spill.

       The purpose of AS 41.21.610 — 41.21.630 is to establish the state-owned land and water described in AS 41.21.611(b) as the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve as part of the state park system.  The primary purpose for establishing the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve is to protect and perpetuate the Chilkat bald eagles and their essential habitats within the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve in recognition of their statewide, nationally, and internationally significant values in perpetuity.

       It is the intent of the legislature in enacting AS 41.21.610 — 41.21.630 to provide sufficient protection for the purposes for which the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve is established. Accordingly, the establishment of the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve and the Haines State Forest Resource Management Area under AS 41.15.305 is determined to represent a proper balance between the reservation of state public domain land and water for bald eagle preserve purposes and state public domain land and water more appropriate for multiple use. Therefore, the legislature determines that there is no need for legislation expanding or contracting the boundary of the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve in the future; the legislature further determines that study by a state agency of the expansion or contracting of the boundary of the preserve shall be conducted under AS 41.21.621.

       Inasmuch as the area described in AS 41.21.611(b) exceeds 640 acres, AS 41.21.610 — 41.21.630 are intended to close the area to multiple use in conformity with AS 38.05.300 and the land is dedicated as a special purpose site under art. VIII, § 7 of the state constitution.

      Continued opportunities for traditional uses of the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve at levels and by methods and means that are compatible with the protection of the bald eagle population are guaranteed.
   These historically compatible uses include but are not limited to hunting, trapping, fishing, berry picking, other subsistence and recreational uses, operation of motorized vehicles, and the harvesting of personal-use firewood.
   The level and method or means of traditional use may continue subject to reasonable regulation unless the director of the division of parks of the department, after consultation with the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve Advisory Council, makes a finding that the level or method and means of use is causing significant resource damage that is inconsistent with AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t41c21a06s41.21.610ol1a" target="_self">41.21.610(a)</a></cite> and (b).
   The director of the division of parks shall hold a public hearing in Haines and Klukwan before restricting a traditional use permitted under this section.

     <p>
      It is the policy of the state to preserve and protect the historic, prehistoric, and archeological resources of Alaska from loss, desecration, and destruction so that the scientific, historic, and cultural heritage embodied in these resources may pass undiminished to future generations.
   To this end, the legislature finds and declares that the historic, prehistoric, and archeological resources of the state are properly the subject of concerted and coordinated efforts exercised on behalf of the general welfare of the public in order that these resources may be located, preserved, studied, exhibited, and evaluated.

       The state reserves to itself title to all historic, prehistoric, and archeological resources situated on land owned or controlled by the state, including tideland and submerged land, and reserves to itself the exclusive right of field archeology on state-owned or controlled land. However, nothing in AS 41.35.010 — 41.35.240 diminishes the cultural rights and responsibilities of persons of aboriginal descent or infringes upon their right of possession and use of those resources that may be considered of historic, prehistoric, or archeological value.

       Although title to historic, prehistoric, and archeological resources is in the state, local cultural groups may obtain from the state, or retain, for study or display, artifacts and other items of these resources from their respective cultures or areas if the commission created in AS 41.35.300 finds that (1) the group has a durable building with weatherproof and fireproof construction and humidity control and other factors necessary to serve as a museum which will assure safe preservation of the items, (2) the item sought to be obtained is not one for which there is an undue risk of damage during transportation, and (3) the item sought to be obtained or retained is not one requiring special treatment or care beyond the ability or means of the group requesting it. A group retaining such an item or obtaining one from the state shall house it in the museum building and shall make every reasonable effort to assure its safe preservation. If the commission finds that a local cultural group is not properly taking care of an item the group shall return it to the department.

      The commissioner may issue a permit for the investigation, excavation, gathering, or removal from the natural state, of any historic, prehistoric, or archeological resources of the state.
   A permit may be issued only to persons or organizations qualified to make the investigations, excavations, gatherings, or removals and only if the results of these authorized activities will be made available to the general public through institutions and museums interested in disseminating knowledge on the subjects involved.
   If the historic, prehistoric, or archeological resource involved is one which is, or is located on a site which is, sacred, holy, or of religious significance to a cultural group, the consent of that cultural group must be obtained before a permit may be issued under this section.
