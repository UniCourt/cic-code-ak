      <p>
       <b>
        Scope of state’s duty to maintain highways
       </b>
       should be defined by ordinary negligence principles. State v. Abbott, 498 P.2d 712 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Highway authorities have a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the highway in a safe condition. State v. Abbott, 498 P.2d 712 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The duty to maintain a highway safe for travel includes not only a duty to maintain the surface of the highway in a condition reasonably safe for travel, but also a duty of warning the traveling public of any other condition which endangers travel, whether caused by a force of nature, such as snow or ice, or by the act of third persons, such as a ditch dug in the sidewalk or roadway or an obstruction placed upon it. State v. Abbott, 498 P.2d 712 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Liability of state for negligent winter highway maintenance. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       See State v. Abbott, 498 P.2d 712 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the basic decision to maintain the highway in a safe condition throughout the winter is reached, the state should not be given discretion to do so negligently. State v. Abbott, 498 P.2d 712 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       In making a determination of negligence by the state in maintaining highways, all of the following factors would be relevant: Whether the state had notice of the dangerous condition, the length of time the ice and snow had been on the highway, the availability of men and equipment, and the amount of traffic on the highway. State v. Abbott, 498 P.2d 712 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       To impose liability on the state for its negligent failure to maintain Alaska highways through the winter would not place an “impossible burden” on the state. State v. Abbott, 498 P.2d 712 (Alaska 1972).

      The department on behalf of the state and as part of the cost of constructing or maintaining a highway may purchase in the open market, acquire, take over, or condemn under the right and power of eminent domain land in fee simple or easements that it considers necessary for present public use, either temporary or permanent, or that it considers necessary and reasonable for the public use. By the same means, the department may obtain material, including clay, gravel, sand, or rock, or the land necessary to obtain material, including access to it. The department may acquire the land or materials notwithstanding the fact that title to it is vested in the state or a department, agency, commission, or institution of the state.
      Acquisition of materials by purchase in the open market under this section is governed by AS 36.30 (State Procurement Code).

       Although the language granting access was erroneously included in the declaration of taking of property for a controlled access facility, a party who purchased the remainder of the adjoining parcel for his insurance business acted reasonably in believing that he would have direct access and was entitled to compensation because he did not receive direct access.

     The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities has management authority over R.S. 2477 [43 U.S.C. § 932 (now repealed)] highways where they occur on non-state land. Where such highways occur on state land, the Alaska Department of Transportation and the state agency having management authority over the state land in question have concurrent authority over the highway. September 14, 1981 Op. Att’y Gen.
    </p>
    <p>
     A highway created by public user under provisions of R.S. 2477 [43 U.S.C. § 932 (now repealed)] cannot be narrowly restricted to a particular type of public travel except in those situations where road closure to certain vehicular use is necessary to protect road surfaces during certain seasons of the year. February 1, 1983 Op. Att’y Gen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The cases seem divided on the question of whether a public right-of-way created under federal grant may be legally abandoned by non-use. For this and other reasons, the Circle-Fairbanks Trail should be expressly reserved in those areas where its physical existence is no longer apparent. February 1, 1983 Op. Att’y Gen.

     <p>
      A tract 100 feet wide between each section of land owned by the state, or acquired from the state, and a tract four rods wide between all other sections in the state, is dedicated for use as public highways.
      The section line is the center of the dedicated right-of-way.
      If the highway is vacated, title to the strip inures to the owner of the tract of which it formed a part by the original survey.

        Acceptance of federal grant. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The enactment of ch. 35, SLA 1953, was a positive act clearly manifesting the territorial legislature’s intent to accept the federal grant under 43 U.S.C. § 932 [now repealed] of right of way for the construction of highways over public lands, not reserved for public uses. Girves v. Kenai Peninsula Borough, 536 P.2d 1221 (Alaska 1975).

       <b>
        Scope of use of easement. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the state expressly reserved a section line easement of 100 feet for use as a public highway when it sold two parcels of land, a development corporation planning to construct a public road along the easement could clear only the amount of trees reasonably necessary to construct the roadway. Andersen v. Edwards, 625 P.2d 282 (Alaska 1981).

        Rights of owners of subservient estates as to highways built on section line easements. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A rule guaranteeing owners of subservient estates of section line easements a right of direct access to any highways which may be built on those easements would be inconsistent with the purpose of this statute, which is to provide easements on which it is relatively easy and inexpensive for the state to build highways.
       Compensation for loss of direct access would have the opposite effect:
       it would greatly increase the cost of constructing controlled access highways on section line easements. 0.958 Acres v. State, 762 P.2d 96 (Alaska 1988), modified, 769 P.2d 990 (Alaska 1989).
      </p>

        Compensation owed when landowner deprived of reasonable access. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       When the state condemns the fee interest in land in which it owns a section line easement, it owes no compensation for the loss of access to the easement, since no preexisting right was taken.
       Only if the taking deprives the landowner of reasonable access to the network of streets to which it previously had access would the state owe compensation. 0.958 Acres v. State, 762 P.2d 96 (Alaska 1988), modified, 769 P.2d 990 (Alaska 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The question whether a condemnee’s remaining access to a condemned section line easement is reasonable is plainly a matter of degree.
       It involves an ad hoc analysis of the roads that actually or potentially lead to the property after the condemnation to determine if they are suitable for the traffic that would likely go to the property.
       The analysis necessarily involves an examination of the potential use of the property. 0.958 Acres v. State, 762 P.2d 96 (Alaska 1988), modified, 769 P.2d 990 (Alaska 1989).
      </p>

        Nominal rather than actual damages

       are appropriate for condemnation of the fee underlying a highway right-of-way unless there is a showing of special value. 0.958 Acres v. State, 762 P.2d 96 (Alaska 1988), modified, 769 P.2d 990 (Alaska 1989).

        No duty to compensate for condemnee’s increased burden of subdividing. —

      <p>
       Even though section line easement condemnees may, as a result of the condemnation, have to dedicate more land for rights-of-way in subdividing their properties than they would have in the absence of the condemnation, the state is not required to compensate them for that increased burden. 0.958 Acres v. State, 762 P.2d 96 (Alaska 1988), modified, 769 P.2d 990 (Alaska 1989).

      Insurance must be maintained at all times on a tractor truck. If the truck owner works out an arrangement with his lessee in which the lessee will purchase insurance in the requisite amounts, this would be satisfactory under the statute, since the intent is to require all trucks to be insured.
      However, if the lessee fails to procure or maintain insurance, the statute will place the responsibility for this failure on the owner. February 19, 1986 Op. Att’y Gen. (issued under former AS

       Defendant’s nine and a half foot road grader was an oversized “vehicle” for purposes of 17 AAC 25.011; accordingly, he needed a permit to operate it on the state highway system. The Court of Appeals of Alaska held that, except where otherwise specified, 17 AAC 25 regulates all wheeled vehicles operating on the state highway system, not just commercial motor vehicles. Boyd v.

       Evidence showed that defendant was operating a commercial motor vehicle where defendant presented no evidence that his vehicle was exempt from the state regulations because it was used “exclusively” for non-commercial purposes; the magistrate could reasonably conclude that defendant was engaged in activities that were incidental to and done in furtherance of his business.

      Opinions of attorney general. —

    </p>
    <p>
     The safety of persons using the road is of overriding importance when weighed against the interest of a sign owner who has illegally placed a sign where it threatens public safety. January 3, 1984 Op. Att’y Gen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Department of Transportation and Public Facilities may summarily remove a sign or other object it determines to be a visual obstruction or a safety hazard; so long as it protects the sign or other object upon removal, the department is protecting the owner’s only recognizable interest. January 3, 1984 Op. Att’y Gen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Department of Transportation and Public Facilities may not collect the cost of removal of a sign or other object unless the owner has had an opportunity to remove the object and save that cost. The department may use a fee payment schedule instead of figuring the actual removal cost in every case, as long as the schedule is based upon and reflects actual removal costs incurred by the department; and it may charge a reasonable fee for storing the sign. January 3, 1984 Op. Att’y Gen.

     Encroachment under this article covers any intrusion into the highway right of way, including signs, or infringement of the limitations on use of the right of way. January 3, 1984 Op. Att’y Gen.

    <p>
     The Department of Transportation and Public Facilities may not collect the cost of removal of a sign or other object unless the owner has had an opportunity to remove the sign or other object and save the cost. The department may use a fee payment schedule instead of figuring the actual removal cost in every case, as long as the schedule is based upon and reflects actual removal costs incurred by the department, and it may charge a reasonable fee for storing the sign or other object.

      The safety of persons using the road is of overriding importance when weighed against the interest of a sign owner who has illegally placed a sign where it threatens public safety. January 3, 1984 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      An encroachment which obstructs anyone’s view of the road is one which “obstructs . . . the highway or road” and also presents a serious danger to the public. January 3, 1984 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department of Transportation and Public Facilities may summarily remove a sign or other object it determines to be a visual obstruction or a safety hazard; so long as it protects the sign or other object upon removal, the department is protecting the owner’s only recognizable interest. January 3, 1984 Op. Att’y Gen.

      Alaska may assert criminal jurisdiction over all persons traveling on state ferries within the territorial sea. Congress made an express grant of power to the state for marine jurisdiction. Thus, while Alaska’s jurisdiction over the territorial sea is not exclusive, but is concurrent with that of the United States, state enforcement officers may exercise their authority as long as the vessel is within the territorial sea, see 1964 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 5.
