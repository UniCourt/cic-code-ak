       Whenever the department agrees to accept less than the full amount of tax or penalty that has been assessed (as distinguished from making a correction to an assessment in the course of an administrative appeal under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c05a03s43.05.240" target="_self">43.05.240</a></cite>), the department has compromised the tax or penalty within the meaning of this section, and the attorney general’s approval is required.

     <p>
      Before taking office, the commissioner shall furnish a bond to the state.
   The bond shall be approved by the attorney general and filed with the Department of Administration, and a copy of it shall be filed in the attorney general’s office.
   The bond shall be conditioned that the principal will faithfully discharge the duties of the office, keep a strict, true and correct account of all money disbursed, and that the principal will properly account for it and will pay over to a successor or other person entitled by law to receive it all money or property in the hands or possession of the principal, in accordance with law; or, in default, that the parties executing the bond will pay to the state and others injured all damages, costs, and expenses resulting from the default. The surety on the bond shall be a surety company authorized to transact business in the state.
   All premiums for the commissioner’s bond shall be paid by the state. The amount of the bond shall be $200,000, but if the funds in the treasury of the state exceed the amount of the bond given by the commissioner, or if for any reason the governor and the Department of Administration consider the bond insufficient they shall notify the commissioner of that fact, and the commissioner shall give the additional bond with sufficient sureties, within the time and in the amount that the governor and the Department of Administration consider necessary for the safety of the state.

       The Office of Tax Appeals erred in finding that the corporation had reasonable cause for notifying the Department of Revenue of changes to its federal tax returns more than sixty days after the IRS’s action, because being “too busy” is not reasonable cause for late filing, and the corporation cannot avoid the late filing penalty. Dep't of Revenue v. Dyncorp &amp; Subsidiaries, 14 P.3d 981 (Alaska 2000).

       Division of audit to have access to records of state agencies, whether confidential or not. 1972 Op. Att’y Gen., issued under former AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c20a03s43.20.190" target="_self">43.20.190</a></cite>.

      <p>
       A legislative auditor may not examine confidential records on file for state income tax returns and wage information submitted by employees and employers to the Department of Labor in connection with the administration of the State Employment Security Act to determine if persons receiving assistance from the Department of Health and Social Services under their Adult Public Assistance and Aid to families with dependent children were eligible.
   Such data is within the ambit of protection intended to be afforded the right of privacy under § 22, art. I, of the Alaska Constitution. 1972 Op. Att’y Gen., issued under former AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c20a03s43.20.190" target="_self">43.20.190</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the taxpayer files the notice of appeal, a Department of Revenue hearing decision may be made public because the taxpayer is, in effect, waiving any right to confidentiality he may have had. June 16, 1983 Op. Att’y Gen., modifying March 12, 1980 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The department can publish decisions that have not been appealed or for which confidentiality was not voluntarily waived if it establishes guidelines for publication to protect a taxpayer’s identity. June 16, 1983 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Publication of delinquent taxpayer lists under subsection (e) would not violate Ak. Const. art. I, § 22, which guarantees the right of privacy. August 21, 1985 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (e), authorizing publication, does not conflict with subsection (a), which makes confidential the reports and returns filed under this title since subsection (e) simply exempts from the broader confidentiality provision the name of a delinquent taxpayer. August 21, 1985 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       For discussion of liability for errors in names and amounts if a list is published under subsection (e), see August 21, 1985 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The department may choose to not publish the names of delinquent taxpayers owing less than a certain amount, so long as there is a rational basis for excluding certain names from publication. August 21, 1985 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The department may limit publication by publishing certain names in certain localities so long as there is a rational basis for doing so. August 21, 1985 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adoption of regulations setting forth the dates of publication and other pertinent information and providing notice regarding publication to the taxpayer at the time notice and demand is made, taken together, would provide adequate notice to each delinquent taxpayer, sufficient to satisfy due process requirements. August 21, 1985 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The department should be relatively immune from attack on due process and other grounds for publishing a list of delinquent taxpayers owing more than a certain amount if publication is not made until notice has been provided under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c05a03s43.05.245" target="_self">43.05.245</a></cite> and the appeal period under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c05a03s43.05.240" target="_self">43.05.240</a></cite> has run.

       The Department of Revenue could disclose information obtained in the audit of Big Three Industries, Inc., to Big Three Lincoln Alaska, Inc., in the course of the hearing process on Big Three Lincoln’s administrative appeal of the determination that it was engaged in a unitary business with Big Three Industries. September 10, 1986 Op. Att’y Gen.

       The Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute may not have access to a list of processors whose total value paid for seafood products during the previous calendar year exceeds $50,000, since the list can only be produced by extracting information from tax returns of seafood processors and since release of the list would divulge exactly which processors reported over $50,000 paid for seafood during the previous calendar year. September 9, 1987 Op. Att’y Gen.

       Under limited circumstances, the Department of Revenue may disclose confidential tax records to members of the legislative branch under AS 09.25.100 (now AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.40.html#t40c25a01s40.25.100" target="_blank">40.25.100</a></cite>) and this section.

       Given the lack of connection between most information sought on a tax return and a person’s more intimate concerns and the confidentiality protections afforded by this section, the state’s interest in the implementation of its tax system justifies and outweighs any privacy rights violated by compulsion to fill out tax forms or testify before a revenue agent.

The taxpayer shall be given access to the taxpayer’s file in the department in the matter for preparation for the informal conference.

    Assessment and collection of tax, penalties, and interest.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If a taxpayer fails to file a return or report required by this title in the time required by law or regulation, or makes an erroneous or fraudulent return, the department shall proceed to assess the license fees, tax, penalties, or interest and make a return from information that it obtains. An assessment or a return subscribed by the department in accordance with this section is presumed sufficient for all legal purposes. However, nothing prevents a taxpayer from presenting evidence or other information in an informal conference under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c05a03s43.05.240" target="_self">43.05.240</a></cite> or in an appeal under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c05a03s43.05.241" target="_self">43.05.241</a></cite> in order to rebut the presumed sufficiency of an assessment or return subscribed by the department, nor does the presumption of sufficiency alter the parties’ respective burdens of proof once the taxpayer has presented evidence or other material information to rebut that presumption. The assessment of license fees, tax, penalties, or interest under this section occurs when the department issues a notice and demand for payment of the license fees, tax, penalties, or interest. The notice and demand for payment is issued when the notice and demand is delivered to the taxpayer in person or placed in the United States mail, addressed to the last known address of the taxpayer. Penalties and interest assessed under this title shall be collected in the same manner as provided in this title for the collection of tax or license fees.

      <p>
       During administrative appeal proceedings the Division of Petroleum Revenue may introduce evidence concerning a different theory or method of valuation or new issues not addressed in the audit report and notice of assessment appealed by the taxpayer. October 16, 1984 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>

       The statute of limitations on assessments does not prohibit the hearing officer from determining that the correct amount of tax due the state is more than that stated in the notice of assessment from which the taxpayer appealed. October 16, 1984 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the taxpayer pays the amount of tax in the notice of assessment, the Division of Petroleum Revenue may not reopen the matter and issue an amended assessment after the statute of limitations expires. However, if a notice of assessment is timely issued within the period of limitation under this section and the taxpayer appeals the assessment under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c05a03s43.05.240" target="_self">43.05.240</a></cite>, the statute of limitations is suspended for the duration of administrative appeal proceedings.

      <p>
       Oil and gas production taxes under
   AS 43.55 are separate taxes imposed by different statutes for the purpose of applying the statute of limitations. If a taxpayer pays the assessed tax for oil and appeals only the assessment for gas, the Division of Petroleum Revenue may not issue an amended assessment for oil production taxes after the statute of limitations has run.

       1. Any taxpayer subject to an income tax whose income is subject to apportionment and allocation for tax purposes pursuant to the laws of a party state or pursuant to the laws of subdivisions in two or more party states may elect to apportion and allocate the taxpayer’s income in the manner provided by the laws of such state or by the laws of such states and subdivisions without reference to this compact, or may elect to apportion and allocate in accordance with Article IV.
   This election for any tax year may be made in all party states or subdivisions thereof or in any one or more of the party states or subdivisions thereof without reference to the election made in the others.
   For the purposes of this paragraph, taxes imposed by subdivisions shall be considered separately from state taxes and the apportionment and allocation also may be applied to the entire tax base.
   In no instance wherein Article IV is employed for all subdivisions of a state may the sum of all apportionments and allocations to subdivisions within a state be greater than the apportionment and allocation that would be assignable to that state if the apportionment or allocation were being made with respect to a state income tax.

   The Multistate Tax Commission, not more than once in five years, may adjust the $100,000 figure in order to reflect such changes as may occur in the real value of the dollar, and such adjusted figure, upon adoption by the commission, shall replace the $100,000 figure specifically provided herein.

       2. Any taxpayer having income from business activity which is taxable both within and outside this state, other than activity as a financial organization or public utility or the rendering of purely personal services by an individual, shall allocate and apportion net income as provided in this Article. If a taxpayer has income from business activity as a public utility but derives the greater percentage of income from activities subject to this Article, the taxpayer may elect to allocate and apportion the taxpayer’s entire net income as provided in this Article.

       (b) Net rents and royalties from tangible personal property are allocable to this state: (1) if and to the extent that the property is utilized in this state, or (2) in their entirety if the taxpayer’s commercial domicile is in this state and the taxpayer is not organized under the laws of or taxable in the state in which the property is utilized.
      </p>
      <p>
       (c) The extent of utilization of tangible personal property in a state is determined by multiplying the rents and royalties by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property in the state during the rental or royalty period in the taxable year and the denominator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property everywhere during all rental or royalty periods in the taxable year.
   If the physical location of the property during the rental or royalty period is unknown or unascertainable by the taxpayer, tangible personal property is utilized in the state in which the property was located at the time the rental or royalty payer obtained possession.

      <p>
       (b) A patent is utilized in a state to the extent that it is employed in production, fabrication, manufacturing, or other processing in the state or to the extent that a patented product is produced in the state.
   If the basis of receipts from patent royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the patent is utilized in the state in which the taxpayer’s commercial domicile is located.
      </p>
      <p>
       (c) A copyright is utilized in a state to the extent that printing or other publication originates in the state.

   Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight times the net annual rental rate.
   Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from subrentals.
      </p>
      <p>
       12. The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the tax period but the tax administrator may require the averaging of monthly values during the tax period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the taxpayer’s property.
      </p>
      <p>
       13. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in this state during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period.

      <p>
       (c) some of the service is performed in the state and (1) the base of operations or, if there is no base of operations, the place from which the service is directed or controlled is in the state, or (2) the base of operations or the place from which the service is directed or controlled is not in any state in which some part of the service is performed, but the individual’s residence is in this state.
      </p>
      <p>
       15. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer in this state during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period.
      </p>
      <p>
       16. Sales of tangible personal property are in this state if:
      </p>
      <p>
       (a) the property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than the United States Government, within this state regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or

      </p>
      <p>
       (a) the income-producing activity is performed in this state; or
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) the income-producing activity is performed both in and outside this state and a greater proportion of the income-producing activity is performed in this state than in any other state, based on costs of performance.
      </p>
      <p>
       18. If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this Article do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in this state, the taxpayer may petition for or the tax administrator may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer’s business activity, if reasonable:
      </p>
      <p>
       (a) separate accounting;
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) the exclusion of any one or more of the factors;

      <p>
       (c) the inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly represent the taxpayer’s business activity in this state; or
      </p>
      <p>
       (d) the employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.

      <p>
       2. Any party state or subdivision thereof desiring to make or participate in an audit of any accounts, books, papers, records or other documents may request the commission to perform the audit on its behalf.
   In responding to the request, the commission shall have access to and may examine, at any reasonable time, such accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents and any relevant property or stock of merchandise. The commission may enter into agreements with party states or their subdivisions for assistance in performance of the audit. The commission shall make charges, to be paid by the state or local government or governments for which it performs the service, for any audits performed by it in order to reimburse itself for the actual costs incurred in making the audit.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. The commission may require the attendance of any person within the state where it is conducting an audit or part thereof at a time and place fixed by it within such state for the purpose of giving testimony with respect to any account, book, paper, document, other record, property or stock of merchandise being examined in connection with the audit.

The commission may apply to any court having power to issue compulsory process for orders in aid of its powers and responsibilities pursuant to this Article and any and all such courts shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders. Failure of any person to obey any such order shall be punishable as contempt of the issuing court. If the party or subject matter on account of which the commission seeks an order is within the jurisdiction of the court to which application is made, such application may be to a court in the state or subdivision on behalf of which the audit is being made or a court in the state in which the object of the order being sought is situated. The provisions of this paragraph apply only to courts in a state that has adopted this Article.

       5. The commission may decline to perform any audit requested if it finds that its available personnel or other resources are insufficient for the purpose or that, in the terms requested, the audit is impracticable of satisfactory performance. If the commission, on the basis of its experience, has reason to believe that an audit of a particular taxpayer, either at a particular time or on a particular schedule, would be of interest to a number of party states or their subdivisions, it may offer to make the audit or audits, the offer to be contingent on sufficient participation therein as determined by the commission.

      <p>
       6. Information obtained by any audit pursuant to this Article shall be confidential and available only for tax purposes to party states, their subdivisions or the United States.

      <p>
       2. The commission shall select and maintain an arbitration panel composed of officers and employees of state and local governments and private persons who shall be knowledgeable and experienced in matters of tax law and administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Whenever a taxpayer who has elected to employ Article IV, or whenever the laws of the party state or subdivision thereof are substantially identical with the relevant provisions of Article IV, the taxpayer, by written notice to the commission and to each party state or subdivision thereof that would be affected, may secure arbitration of an apportionment or allocation, if the taxpayer is dissatisfied with the final administrative determination of the tax agency of the state or subdivision with respect thereto on the ground that it would subject the taxpayer to double or multiple taxation by two or more party states or subdivisions thereof. Each party state and subdivision thereof hereby consents to the arbitration as provided herein, and agrees to be bound thereby.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. The arbitration board shall be composed of one person selected by the taxpayer, one by the agency or agencies involved, and one member of the commission’s arbitration panel. If the agencies involved are unable to agree on the person to be selected by them, such person shall be selected by lot from the total membership of the arbitration panel. The two persons selected for the board in the manner provided by the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall jointly select the third member of the board. If they are unable to agree on the selection, the third member shall be selected by lot from among the total membership of the arbitration panel. No member of a board selected by lot shall be qualified to serve if the member is an officer or employee or is otherwise affiliated with any party to the arbitration proceeding. Residence within the jurisdiction of a party to the arbitration proceeding shall not constitute affiliation within the meaning of this paragraph.

       5. The board may sit in any state or subdivision party to the proceeding, in the state of the taxpayer’s incorporation, residence or domicile, in any state where the taxpayer does business, or in any place that it finds most appropriate for gaining access to evidence relevant to the matter before it.
      </p>

      <p>
       7. The board shall have power to administer oaths, take testimony, subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents, and issue commissions to take testimony. Subpoenas may be signed by any member of the board. In case of failure to obey a subpoena, and upon application by the board, any judge of a court of competent jurisdiction of the state in which the board is sitting or in which the person to whom the subpoena is directed may be found may make an order requiring compliance with the subpoena, and the court may punish failure to obey the order as a contempt. The provisions of this paragraph apply only in states that have adopted this Article.
      </p>

        Constitutional to value nonproductive leaseholds at cost. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Valuation of an oil company’s nonproductive Alaska leaseholds at cost instead of at zero in determining what proportion of the company’s worldwide property was in Alaska was neither unfair nor unconstitutional. Gulf Oil Corp. v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 755 P.2d 372 (Alaska 1988).

       The Multistate Tax Compact is basically a restatement of the former Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act, with a few minor changes. Department of Revenue, Child Support Enforcement Div. v. Beans, 965 P.2d 725 (Alaska 1998).

      <p>
       <b>
        Inclusion in apportionment formula. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Revenue properly included nonproducing oil and gas leaseholds in the apportionment formula of former AS 43.20.130, which was virtually identical to that in Article IV of this compact; the inclusion did not violate the taxpayer’s due process rights. Department of Revenue, Child Support Enforcement Div. v. Beans, 965 P.2d 725 (Alaska 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inclusion of the amounts of income tax payments made by an oil company to the countries of Kuwait, Iran, Nigeria, Ecuador, Venezuela and Angola in the company’s worldwide pre-tax income did not result in an unfair representation of the company’s Alaska activity. Gulf Oil Corp. v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 755 P.2d 372 (Alaska 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Revenue properly determined that the revenues from company’s delivery of eight-story high modules for Prudhoe Bay were derived not from services alone but from transactions involving the sale of tangible personal property delivered inside the State of Alaska, and therefore properly included the revenues in the Alaska numerator of the sale factor in the formula set out in article IV, paragraph 9 of this section. Department of Revenue v. Parsons Corp., 843 P.2d 1238 (Alaska 1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 940, 113 S. Ct. 2416, 124 L. Ed. 2d 638 (U.S. 1993).

        Application of apportionment formula to unitary businesses. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding of unity is prerequisite to constitutional application of Alaska’s apportionment formula. Earth Resources Co. v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 665 P.2d 960 (Alaska 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of parent corporation’s extensive involvement in management and in financing of subsidiary’s business operations, and of benefit to subsidiary from various economics of scale warranted finding of a unitary business to which apportionment formula of AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c20a01s43.20.065" target="_self">43.20.065</a></cite> must be applied. Earth Resources Co. v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 665 P.2d 960 (Alaska 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       One who attacks an apportionment formula’s application to a unitary business may do so only with a showing of clear and cogent evidence, and trial court erred in applying standard which addressed whether the record as a whole contained substantial evidence from which department could have concluded that the supporting department’s conclusion that a business is unitary in nature; however, such error was harmless where correct result had been reached by trial court. Earth Resources Co. v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 665 P.2d 960 (Alaska 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Question whether a taxpayer’s business is unitary is a question of law which does not require agency expertise for its resolution, and the substitution of judgment standard of review should be applied by courts reviewing the Department of Revenue’s application of the unitary business concept to a taxpayer’s business activity. Earth Resources Co. v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 665 P.2d 960 (Alaska 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Delaware corporation engaged in mining gold in Alaska was part of a unitary business involving two other corporations, where the companies were functionally integrated, had centralized management, and shared economies of scale.

      Constitutionality of chapter. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The Alaska Net Income Tax Act is constitutional as applied to nonresident crab fishermen who fish off the coast of Alaska in international waters and sell their catch to Alaska processors, and such taxation does not violate the due process and commerce clauses of the United States Constitution, or of the Interstate Income Act, 15 U.S.C. § 381. Sjong v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 622 P.2d 967 (Alaska 1981), overruled in part, Rosen v. State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy, 689 P.2d 478 (Alaska 1984).
    </p>
    <p>
     This chapter is not unconstitutional as wanting in uniformity. Alaska S.S. Co. v. Mullaney, 84 F. Supp. 561, 12 Alaska 433 (D. Alaska 1949), aff'd, 180 F.2d 805, 12 Alaska 594 (9th Cir. Alaska 1950).
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Alaska can constitutionally levy tax on net income of seamen
     </b>
     engaged in interstate and foreign commerce, where the tax is levied only on that portion of the seamen’s net income which is attributed to their activity within the boundaries of the State of Alaska. State v. Petronia, 69 Wn.2d 460, 418 P.2d 755 (Wash. 1966).

    <p>
     <b>
      Interstate commerce not singled out by chapter. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     There is nothing in this chapter which singles out for special treatment interstate commerce or those who are engaged in interstate commerce because and on account of such commerce. Alaska S.S. Co. v. Mullaney, 180 F.2d 805, 12 Alaska 594 (9th Cir. Alaska 1950).

      Graduated income taxes are based on policy grounds. —

    <p>
     Graduated income taxes, involving as they do the concept of ability to pay, are based upon intelligible grounds of policy. Alaska S.S. Co. v. Mullaney, 180 F.2d 805, 12 Alaska 594 (9th Cir. Alaska 1950).

       In § 3, 2006 Primary Election Ballot Measure No. 2, the material set out in subsections (h) and (i) was enacted as subsections (b) and (c) and relettered in 2006, at which time, in (i), “(h) of this section” was substituted for “(b) of this section” and “AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c52a02s43.52.295" target="_self">43.52.295</a></cite>” was substituted for “AS 43.52.095” to reflect the 2006 renumbering of that section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 3, 2006 Primary Election Ballot Measure No. 2, read “AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c20a01s43.20.021" target="_self">43.20.021</a></cite> is repealed and reenacted as follows:

   (a) Sections 26 U.S.C.
   — 1399 and 6001 — 7872 (Internal Revenue Code), as amended, are adopted by reference as a part of this chapter. These portions of the Internal Revenue Code have full force and effect under this chapter unless excepted to or modified by other provisions of this chapter. (b) Nothing in this chapter or in AS 43.19 (Multistate Tax Compact) may be construed as an exception to or modification of 26 U.S.C. 883. (c) The provision in (b) of this section does not apply to commercial passenger vessels as defined in AS 43.52.095.”.
   If this section were interpreted as a repeal and reenactment of the entire section, it would have had the effect of eliminating the provisions of (b) — (d), (f), and (g) of this section, which involve matters that are outside the scope of the subject of the initiative that constituted the ballot measure.
   In setting out the changes made by section 3 of the initiative, the changes made are, instead, shown as an amendment of (a) of this section and the addition of subsections (h) and (i).
   Treatment of the material in this manner is consistent with the single subject of the initiative (commercial passenger vessels) and the descriptive title for the initiative as prepared and submitted by the initiative’s sponsors, as well as the actual introductory language of section 3 of the initiative, which set out the section number as “
   
    Sec. <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c20a01s43.20.021ol1a" target="_self">43.20.021(a)</a></cite>

   The courts, however, are the final arbiters of the meaning of the initiative.

       The Office of Tax Appeals erred in finding that the corporation had reasonable cause for notifying the Department of Revenue of changes to its federal tax returns more than sixty days after the IRS’s action, because being “too busy” is not reasonable cause for late filing, and the corporation cannot avoid the late filing penalty.

      <p>
       The Alaska Net Income Tax Act is constitutional as applied to nonresident crab fishermen who fish off the coast of Alaska in international waters and sell their catch to Alaska processors, and such taxation does not violate the due process and commerce clauses of the United States Constitution, or of the Interstate Income Act,
   15 U.S.C. § 381.
   Sjong v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 622 P.2d 967 (Alaska 1981), overruled in part, Rosen v. State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy, 689 P.2d 478 (Alaska 1984).

       Because the allocation formula adopted by the Department of Revenue was constitutional on its face, and did not produce a grossly distorted result in the assessment of the taxpayer’s tax liability, the apportionment formula was valid.

       Evidence of parent corporation’s extensive involvement in management and in financing of subsidiary’s business operations, and of benefit to subsidiary from various economies of scale warranted finding of a unitary business to which apportionment formula of this section must be applied.

      <p>
       A heavy burden is placed on a taxpayer challenging a state’s allocation of his income to prove by clear and cogent evidence that the income attributed by the state is out of all appropriate proportion to the business transacted in that state, or has led to a grossly distorted result. Sjong v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 622 P.2d 967 (Alaska 1981), overruled in part, Rosen v. State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy, 689 P.2d 478 (Alaska 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       One who attacks on apportionment formula’s application to a unitary business may do so only with a showing of clear and cogent evidence, and trial court erred in applying standard which addressed whether the record as a whole contained substantial evidence from which department could have concluded that the supporting department’s conclusion that a business is unitary in nature; however, such error was harmless where correct result had been reached by trial court.

        Constitutionality. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the company’s business was unitary, the court rejected the company’s challenge to the constitutionality of taxing all of its income under formula apportionment. The company was centrally managed, practiced economies of scale, and its subsidiaries were functionally integrated. Tesoro Corp. v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 312 P.3d 830 (Alaska 2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1149, 134 S. Ct. 2697, 189 L. Ed. 2d 740 (U.S. 2014).

        Use of formula apportionment method not constitutionally required. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The State of Alaska does not, as a matter of constitutional law, have to use the formula apportionment method to determine the portion of each corporation’s worldwide oil production and pipeline transportation income that can be attributed to Alaska; the Oil and Gas Corporate Income Tax, former AS 43.21, which was repealed in 1982, was constitutional. Atlantic Richfield Co. v. State, 705 P.2d 418 (Alaska 1985).

        Penalities. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Administrative law judge did not err in finding penalties to be permissible; the Department of Revenue did not assess penalties because the company failed to acquiesce in the statute’s apportionment scheme, but because the company failed to acknowledge that one business segment was unitary with another. Tesoro Corp. v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 312 P.3d 830 (Alaska 2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1149, 134 S. Ct. 2697, 189 L. Ed. 2d 740 (U.S. 2014).

        Taxation formula. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Department of Revenue applied the three-factor property, sales, and extraction formula to apportion the company’s income, and the company’s ownership of massive infrastructure in the state showed it made greater use of state protections, there was nothing distortive about attributing the company’s tax burden accordingly, the department’s adherence to the widely accepted practice of excluding intangible property was not unreasonable, and the argument that disparate profits across subsidiaries were indicative of unfair taxation was rejected. Tesoro Corp. v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 312 P.3d 830 (Alaska 2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1149, 134 S. Ct. 2697, 189 L. Ed. 2d 740 (U.S. 2014).

      <p>
       Company lacked standing to challenge the internal consistency of the state’s tax scheme because the company did not demonstrate that it was injured by any inconsistency in this scheme, or that the inconsistency it identified had increased its tax burden in Alaska; the company only had to show that there was a risk of multiple taxation because Alaska treated the company unfairly, but the company made no such showing. Tesoro Corp. v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 312 P.3d 830 (Alaska 2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1149, 134 S. Ct. 2697, 189 L. Ed. 2d 740 (U.S. 2014).

        Opinions of attorney general. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska law does not specifically provide for a method of assessment nor have any regulations been published concerning assessment. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 33.
      </p>
      <p>
       When used in connection with taxation, “assessment” is a process that fixes the liability of the taxpayer and ascertains the facts and furnishes the data for the proper preparation of the tax rolls. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 33.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Revenue has established an internal administrative procedure for determining tax liability.
   This procedure constitutes an “assessment” under the applicable general law, even though that procedure is not set out in the Income Tax Act or regulations promulgated by the Department of Revenue. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 33.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Assessment” is strictly an administrative determination that the person is indebted to the state for taxes due.
   It is an official estimate, as determined from the return. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 33.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “assessment” does not contemplate any billing or notice to the taxpayer. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 33.
      </p>
      <p>
       The date of assessment in Alaska is the date that the Department of Revenue, in the course of its normal administrative procedure, makes final the amount on which the attempt to collect the tax will be based.
   It is the date the final amount of tax liability from which billing is to be made is listed on the tax ledger card. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 33.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under no interpretation can the date of billing be considered the date of assessment. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 33.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under
   §§ 6501,
   6502(a) and
   6503(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the assessment must be made within three years of filing date of the return and collection procedures must be started six years [now 10 years] after the date of the assessment.
   1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 33.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the tax liability is placed on the ledger card within three years from the date of the filing of the return, collection of the tax is not barred by the statute of limitations. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 33.

        The basic scheme of this chapter
       </b>
       is to make the state’s claim for income taxes contingent upon the establishment of liability for federal income taxes. Hickel v. Stevenson, 416 P.2d 236 (Alaska 1966).

        Effect of taxpayer’s waiver of federal period of limitation. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       By reason of the express adoption of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code relating to an exception to the three-year period of limitation, (Sec. 6501(a)a of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954) the effect of a taxpayer’s waiver of the federal period of limitation for assessment and collection of taxes is to effect a like waiver of such period as to the assessment and collection of Alaska taxes. Hickel v. Stevenson, 416 P.2d 236 (Alaska 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the extension of the period for assessment under federal law did not effect a like extension under this chapter, it would mean that any Alaska tax based on an additional assessment of federal tax after three years from the date of filing a return would not be collectible because of the three-year period of limitation, unless the state tax officials audited the taxpayer’s federal returns within the three-year period to ascertain whether the federal computation of tax was correct.
   Such an interpretation would be contrary to the prime objective of this chapter which was aimed at convenience to the taxpayer and simplicity of administration. Hickel v. Stevenson, 416 P.2d 236 (Alaska 1966).

The references to the IRC contained in this section and AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c20a01s43.20.021" target="_self">43.20.021</a></cite> make waiver agreements between the IRS and the taxpayer effective for the purpose of extending the state statute of limitations.

        Restricted federal waivers and state statute of limitations. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A restricted waiver is only effective for state adjustments that are reasonably related to the issues covered by the restricted federal waiver; therefore, a restricted federal waiver extends the state statute of limitations only so far as the issues covered in the restricted waiver would affect state tax liability. Louisiana-Pacific Corp. v. Dep't of Revenue, 21 P.3d 1274 (Alaska 2001).

       <b>
        Taxpayers estopped from asserting statute of limitations. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure of certain taxpayers to notify the department of the modification in their federal income tax liability for two years constitutes a breach of the duty to give notice of modification pursuant to AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c20a01s43.20.030" target="_self">43.20.030</a></cite> and amounts to the concealment of a material fact.
   Where the state, to its detriment, relying on that lack of notice, as it reasonably could, failed to institute the statutory mechanism for collection of additional taxes, the taxpayers are estopped from asserting the protection of the statute of limitations embodied in subsection (b) of this section. Stevenson v. Burgess, 570 P.2d 728 (Alaska 1977).

      In a case where there is a refusal or neglect to pay a tax, including interest, penalty, additional amount, or addition to the tax, together with additional costs that accrue, the attorney general, at the request of the department may file an action in the superior court to enforce the lien of the state for the tax upon property and rights to property, real or personal, or to subject the property and rights to property owned by the delinquent, or in which the delinquent has a right, title, or interest to the payment of the tax.
   The action shall be commenced and pursued in the manner provided for the foreclosure of liens in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.09.html#t09c45a04s09.45.170" target="_blank">09.45.170</a></cite> — <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.09.html#t09c45a04s09.45.220" target="_blank">09.45.220</a></cite>, which are applicable to tax liens arising under this chapter to the extent that the provisions are not inconsistent with other provisions of this chapter.

   The contingency was never satisfied and the sections establishing the proposed annuity program were repealed by § 17, ch. 20, SLA 2002.

     If the legislature enacts any other distribution program which is consistent with the intent of the permanent fund dividend law (AS 43.23), any appropriation to implement that program will be exempt from the appropriation limit of § 16, art. IX, of the state constitution.

     The Alaska Permanent Fund, as currently constituted, should not be subject to federal income tax because it is an asset of the State of Alaska and its income is earned directly by the State of Alaska or, in the alternative, because it is an integral part of the State of Alaska. Further, the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, as currently constituted, should not be subject to federal income tax because it is an integral part of the State of Alaska or, in the alternative, because its income, if any, is excluded from federal income tax under
   Section 115(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). In addition, the adoption of constitutional amendments incorporating into the Constitution a requirement for payment of the permanent fund dividend and a requirement that a portion of Fund earnings be used to defray the State’s obligations to fund public education should not change the federal tax status of the Fund or the Corporation.

     Statutory scheme of former AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c23a01s43.23.010" target="_self">43.23.010</a></cite> held unconstitutional. —

    <p>
     The statutory scheme under former AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c23a01s43.23.010" target="_self">43.23.010</a></cite>, by which the state distributes income derived from its natural resources to the adult citizens of the state in varying amounts, based on the length of each citizen’s residence, violated the equal protection rights of newer state citizens. Zobel v. Williams, 457 U.S. 55, 102 S. Ct. 2309, 72 L. Ed. 2d 672 (U.S. 1982).
    </p>
    <p>
     The state objectives of creating a financial incentive for individuals to establish and maintain Alaska residence, and assuring prudent management of the Permanent Fund and the state’s natural and mineral resources are not rationally related to the distinctions Alaska seeks to make in the dividend program between newer residents and those who have been in the state since 1959. Zobel v. Williams, 457 U.S. 55, 102 S. Ct. 2309, 72 L. Ed. 2d 672 (U.S. 1982).
    </p>
    <p>
     Objective to reward citizens for past contributions is not a legitimate state purpose since this reasoning could open the door to state apportionment of other rights, benefits and services according to length of residency and would permit the states to divide citizens into expanding numbers of permanent classes, a result which would be clearly impermissible. Zobel v. Williams, 457 U.S. 55, 102 S. Ct. 2309, 72 L. Ed. 2d 672 (U.S. 1982).
    </p>
    <p>
     This statute does not impose any threshold warning period on those seeking dividend benefits; persons with less than a full year of residency are entitled to share in the distribution. Nor does the statute purport to establish a test of the bona fides of state residence.
   Instead, the dividend statute creates fixed, permanent distinctions between an ever increasing number of perpetual classes of concededly bona fide residents, based on how long they have been in the state. Zobel v. Williams, 457 U.S. 55, 102 S. Ct. 2309, 72 L. Ed. 2d 672 (U.S. 1982).

     Permanent Fund dividend payments are income and, since these payments are not excludable from gross income as “gifts”, they are therefore subject to the federal income tax. Beattie ex rel. Beattie v. United States, 635 F. Supp. 481 (D. Alaska 1986), aff'd, 831 F.2d 916 (9th Cir. Alaska 1987).

       Subsection (d), which makes incarcerated felons ineligible for permanent fund dividends, does not violate the ex post facto clause of either the United States or the Alaska Constitutions. State v. Anthony, 816 P.2d 1377 (Alaska 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of a permanent fund dividend to an incarcerated felon was not a separate punishment in addition to his sentence for murder for purposes of double jeopardy. Hertz v. Storer, 943 P.2d 725 (Alaska 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1059, 118 S. Ct. 717, 139 L. Ed. 2d 657 (U.S. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The alien eligibility requirement of subparagraph (a)(5)(B) is constitutional because the department has the authority to interpret the statutory language in a manner that meets the purposes of the permanent fund dividend program and that comports with federal law. Dep't of Revenue v. Andrade, 23 P.3d 58 (Alaska 2001).

       Changes in the qualifying date for a permanent fund dividend (PFD) do not violate the constitutional rights of new residents. Plaintiffs, as new residents, had only an inchoate expectancy of a PFD which is not afforded constitutional protection. Underwood v. State, 881 P.2d 322 (Alaska 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1064, 115 S. Ct. 1694, 131 L. Ed. 2d 558 (U.S. 1995).

       Where a divorced mother borrowed money from her childrens’ permanent fund dividends, it was not error on the part of the court to deny the former husband’s request that the mother be ordered to repay the amount taken. Hayes v. Hayes, 922 P.2d 896 (Alaska 1996).

       Because a mother was awarded primary physical custody, a superior court did not err in authorizing her to use the children’s Alaska Permanent Fund Dividends as needed. Ronny M. v. Nanette H., 303 P.3d 392 (Alaska 2013).

      <p>
       Superior court's standard order regarding the child's permanent fund dividend (PFD) was not error or an abuse of discretion because it stated that the PFD could be spent for the child's health, education, and welfare.

       Servicemember, who had been discharged from the Navy, was not eligible to claim a Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) for a certain year where he failed to overcome presumption that he had not been a resident of Alaska for the last five years; servicemember’s argument that the Federal Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Civil Relief Act preempted state law in that area was not persuasive, as that act applied to only two areas, taxation and voting, and PFD was not a tax but a benefit.

        Imposition of 10-year limit on military personnel. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A career Marine Corps officer who was from Alaska and had always maintained significant ties to Alaska, but had been absent for 10 consecutive years due to his military education and service, was not entitled to continue to receive the permanent fund dividend. The 10-year limitation denying people in situations like the officer’s did not violate his equal protection rights; the rule was substantially related to the legitimate interests of limiting dividends to permanent Alaska residents and preventing fraud.

       A Permanent Fund Dividend claimant may not briefly enter the state, physically leave the state for the entire remaining portion of the six-month period, and satisfy the six-month requirement from another location. Heller v. Dep't of Revenue, 314 P.3d 69 (Alaska 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Husband and wife were ineligible for Permanent Fund Dividends for two years because neither met unambiguous statutory residency requirements, since (1) the husband's absence for more than five years created a presumption of nonresidence the husband could not rebut, and (2) the wife's eligibility as an accompanying military spouse depended on the husband's. Jones v. State, 441 P.3d 966 (Alaska 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska Supreme Court could not exercise the Court's equitable powers to award a husband and wife Permanent Fund Dividends for two years because the Court was not allowed to exercise such powers to contravene a properly enacted statute specifying residency requirements for such purposes.

I, § 23; it simply provides that before military personnel can claim state resources through the Permanent Fund Dividend program, the service member must spend six months in state. This provision is consistent with constitutional requirements because it directly advances a state interest that is undoubtedly legitimate. Heller v. Dep't of Revenue, 314 P.3d 69 (Alaska 2013).

       Statutory presumption of nonresidence for Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) purposes created by a husband's absence from Alaska for over five years did not violate the right to travel because (1) different residency requirements could be imposed for different purposes, (2) an intent-to-remain requirement could be applied with other PFD-specific residency requirements, and (3) the statute applied equally to all PFD applicants with long allowable absences. Jones v. State, 441 P.3d 966 (Alaska 2019).

      <p>
       Statutory presumption of nonresidence for Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) purposes created by a husband's absence from Alaska for over five years did not violate Alaska or federal equal protection because (1) minimal scrutiny applied to this mere economic interest, and (2) the statute was substantially related to achieving a legitimate governmental objective. Jones v. State, 441 P.3d 966 (Alaska 2019).

       Statutory presumption of nonresidence for Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) purposes created by a husband's absence from Alaska for over five years was not an unconstitutional ex post facto law because the statute was not a penal statute. Jones v. State, 441 P.3d 966 (Alaska 2019).

       Servicemember, who had been discharged from the Navy, was not eligible to claim a Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) for a certain year where he failed to overcome presumption that he had not been a resident of Alaska for the last five years; servicemember’s argument that the Federal Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Civil Relief Act preempted state law in that area was not persuasive, as that act applied to only two areas, taxation and voting, and PFD was not a tax but a benefit.

       A military family who did not reside in Alaska for five years was not eligible to receive permanent fund dividends under the active duty “allowable absence” provision because they had spent a total of 14 days in Alaska in the five years prior to the application and failed to rebut the presumption that they did not intend to return and remain in Alaska.

      <p>
       Statutory presumption of nonresidence for Permanent Fund Dividend purposes created by a husband's absence from Alaska for over five years was not an unconstitutional irrebuttable presumption because (1) the statute provided a means to rebut the presumption, and (2) reasonable residency requirements could be imposed.

       An administrative regulation, which restricted permanent fund dividend eligibility to aliens with resident alien or refugee status, fell within the delegated authority of the commissioner of revenue to regulate the eligibility of individuals for permanent fund dividends. The regulation was also constitutional under the state and federal equal protection clauses. Limiting the distribution of dividends to those who are lawful permanent residents is rationally related to legitimate objectives of the dividend program.

       Argument of claimant, denied permanent fund dividend because of absence from state for more than 180 days, that he was not provided the same benefits as members of groups who were absent for one of the (former) listed excusable absences, and as such his equal protection rights were violated, was without merit. Church v. Department of Revenue, 973 P.2d 1125 (Alaska 1999).

      <p>
       Petitioner’s absence from the state for more than 180 days in a year for an “inexcusable” reason rendered him ineligible for permanent fund dividends (PFDs), even though he would have been eligible had he been a state employee, since the rules bore a fair and substantial relationship to the legitimate governmental objectives of promoting state residency, preventing fraud in the distribution of PFDs, and simplifying adjudication procedures.

       Claimant who was ineligible for a permanent fund dividend as a matter of law because he was out of the state for more than 180 days, and whose absence did not fit into one of the (former) statutory or regulatory excusable absence categories, was not denied his procedural due process rights when his appeal was denied in a summary adjudication, since, in the absence of a factual dispute, he was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing.

       The statutory and regulatory scheme denying permanent fund dividend to claimant absent from the state for more than 180 days, whose absence did not fit one of the (former) excused categories, does not violate substantive due process.

       A serviceman who was absent more than five years failed to establish intent to return to the state where the evidence showed that he returned for a brief visit only once in a 12-year period, he maintained only motor vehicle registration, voter registration, driver’s license and bar membership in Alaska, and he had not requested reassignment to Alaska.

        Prohibiting permanent fund distribution to illegal aliens. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An administrative regulation, which restricted permanent fund dividend eligibility to aliens with resident alien or refugee status, fell within the delegated authority of the commissioner of revenue to regulate the eligibility of individuals for permanent fund dividends. The regulation was also constitutional under the state and federal equal protection clauses. Limiting the distribution of dividends to those who are lawful permanent residents is rationally related to legitimate objectives of the dividend program. Department of Revenue, Permanent Fund Dividend Div. v. Cosio, 858 P.2d 621 (Alaska 1993).

        Validity of regulation. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Since the purpose of former paragraph (8) (now paragraph 7) is to ensure that permanent fund dividends are only given to permanent residents and a legitimate function of corresponding regulations is to ease the administrative burdens of determining eligibility, 15 AAC 23.163, requiring that absences do not exceed 180 days, is consistent with its statutory purpose.

        Absence for medical treatment. —

      <p>
       “Medical treatment”, as defined in this section, does not mean merely an absence from the state on the advice of one’s doctor, but implies some specific therapeutic application by medical personnel; thus, applicants who were outside Alaska for nearly two-thirds of the year-long eligibility period for the permanent fund dividend did not qualify for an allowable absence for medical treatment, although their medical treatment may have been medically advised. Brodigan v. Alaska Dep't of Revenue, 900 P.2d 728 (Alaska 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A regulation, by allowing an absence for applicants receiving medical treatment if the absence “does not include a seasonal or permanent change of residence,” assures that eligibility is limited to those residents who are temporarily outside actively attempting to treat their medical conditions, and is consistent with the language and purpose of this section. Brodigan v. Alaska Dep't of Revenue, 900 P.2d 728 (Alaska 1995).

      If the tax or a part of the tax is paid or collected out of that part of the estate passing to or in possession of a person other than the executor in the capacity of executor, the person is entitled to a reimbursement out of a part of the estate still undistributed or by a just and equitable contribution by the person whose interest in the estate of the decedent would have been reduced if the tax had been paid before the distribution of the estate or whose interest in the estate is subject to an equal or prior liability for the payment of tax, debts, or other charges against the estate, it being the purpose and intent of this section that so far as is practical and unless otherwise directed by the will of the decedent, the tax shall be paid out of the estate before its distribution; but the department is not charged with enforcing contribution from a person.

      The estate of each decedent whose property is subject to the laws of the state is considered prima facie liable for estate taxes under this chapter, and is subject to a lien for them in an amount which may be later determined to be due and payable on the estate as provided in this chapter.
   The presumption of liability begins on the date of the death of the decedent and continues until the full settlement of all taxes which may be found to be due under this chapter, the settlement to be shown by receipts for all taxes due to be issued by the department as provided for in this chapter.
   Whenever it appears to the department that an estate is not subject to a tax under this chapter the department shall issue to the executor, administrator, curator or other personal representative, or to the heirs, devisees, or legatees of the decedent, a certificate in writing to that effect, showing nonliability to tax, which certificate of nonliability has the same effect as a receipt showing payment.
   The certificate of nonliability is subject to record and admissible in evidence in like manner as receipts showing payment of taxes.
   There shall be paid to the department a fee of $2.50 for each certificate so issued.

       The 1957 amendment to this section, which reduced the tax on motor fuel used in commercial fishing crafts for purposes of commercial fishing from five cents to two cents per gallon, effected no change in the dedication inasmuch as the reduction in the tax was coupled with an exemption from the refund of three cents per gallon formerly allowed to users of fuel in commercial fishing craft for commercial purposes.

     Application of the state oil and gas production tax to oil and gas production from the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska and from onshore federal leases in the Cook Inlet area is not preempted by federal law.
   However, as, by definition, the Outer Continental Shelf consists of submerged lands lying outside the state’s seaward boundaries, Alaska law does not purport to tax oil or gas that is produced from a lease or property on that land.

       For gas produced on and after January 1, 2022, other than gas described in (e) of this section, the department shall allow a producer to make an election, under regulations adopted by the department, to pay in gas the production tax levied by this section in lieu of the tax otherwise levied for the gas by AS 43.55.011(e). An election under this subsection applies only to gas produced from oil and gas leases modified under AS 38.05.180(hh) from which the commissioner of natural resources has determined to take royalty gas in kind under AS 38.05.182.

       A production tax levied by this section is equal to 13 percent of the gas otherwise taxable under AS 43.55.011(e)(3) produced from each oil and gas lease to which an effective election under (a) of this section applies, when and as that gas is produced. The producer shall pay the tax in gas by delivering that 13 percent of the gas to the state at the point of production.

       An assessment under AS 43.05.245 against a producer for an underpayment of a tax levied by this section may be made in terms of an amount of gas or an amount of money, as determined under regulations adopted by the department. If the assessment is made in terms of money, the amount for a month of production for an oil and gas lease subject to an effective election under (a) of this section is the product of the number of units of gas by which the producer’s delivery to the state was less than the amount required by (b) of this section, multiplied by the average gross value at the point of production for each unit of the gas produced by the producer from the lease during the month other than gas that was not subject to tax or gas that was delivered to the state under (b) of this section. The department may allow a credit or refund under AS 43.05.275 for an overpayment of a tax levied by this section that may be issued in the form of gas or money, as determined under regulations adopted by the department. If the credit or refund is allowed in terms of money, the amount of the credit or refund for a month of production for an oil and gas lease subject to an effective election under (a) of this section is the product of the number of units of gas by which the producer’s delivery to the state was more than the amount required under (b) of this section, multiplied by the average gross value at the point of production for each unit of the gas produced by the producer from the lease during the month other than gas that was not subject to tax or gas that was delivered to the state under (b) of this section. Interest that is determined as a percentage of the amount of a tax underpayment or overpayment and a penalty that is a percentage of the amount of a tax underpayment are calculated as a percentage of the amount of money determined in this subsection. An amount of gas that was less than the amount required to be delivered to the state under (b) of this section or an amount of gas that was more than the amount required to be delivered to the state under (b) of this section that is adjusted as provided by a gas balancing agreement to which the state is a party under AS 38.05.020(b)(11) is not subject to assessment under AS 43.05.245 or a credit or refund under AS 43.05.275. In this subsection, “unit” means a unit of measurement for gas identified by the department under regulations adopted by the department and may be expressed as 1,000 cubic feet, 1,000,000 British thermal units, or another appropriate unit of measurement specified by the department under regulations adopted by the department.

       For oil and gas produced on and after January 1, 2022, in making settlement with the royalty owner for oil and gas that is taxable under AS 43.55.011, the producer may deduct the amount of the tax paid on taxable royalty oil and gas, or may deduct taxable royalty oil or gas equivalent in value at the time the tax becomes due to the amount of the tax paid. If the total deductions of installment payments of estimated tax for a calendar year exceed the actual tax for that calendar year, the producer shall, before April 1 of the following year, refund the excess to the royalty owner. In making settlement with the royalty owner for gas that is taxable under AS 43.55.014, the producer may deduct the amount of the gas paid as in-kind tax on taxable royalty gas or may deduct the gross value at the point of production of the gas paid as in-kind tax on taxable royalty gas. Unless otherwise agreed between the producer and the royalty owner, the amount of the tax paid under AS 43.55.011(e) on taxable royalty oil for a calendar year, other than oil the ownership or right to which constitutes a landowner’s royalty interest, is considered to be the gross value at the point of production of the taxable royalty oil produced during the calendar year multiplied by a figure that is a quotient, in which

       The first three unaffiliated persons that drill an offshore exploration well for the purpose of discovering oil or gas in Cook Inlet that penetrates and evaluates a prospect in the pre-Tertiary zone using a jack-up rig are eligible for the credit under this subsection. The person that drills the first exploration well is entitled to a credit in the amount of 100 percent of its exploration expenditures or $25,000,000, whichever is less; the person that drills the second exploration well using the same jack-up rig is entitled to a credit in the amount of 90 percent of its exploration expenditures or $22,500,000, whichever is less; and the person that drills the third exploration well using the same jack-up rig is entitled to a credit in the amount of 80 percent of its exploration expenditures or $20,000,000, whichever is less. A person or an affiliate of a person drilling an exploration well is not entitled to a credit for more than one exploration well under this subsection. The department shall make a determination of the order in which the wells are drilled based on the date and time that the drill bit first turns to the right against the seafloor for the purpose of drilling the well. Exploration expenditures eligible for the credit in this subsection may include the necessary and reasonable costs to modify an existing jack-up rig for use in Cook Inlet, may not include the cost to construct or manufacture a jack-up rig, and, notwithstanding (b) of this section, must be incurred for work performed after March 31, 2010. If the exploration well for which a credit is received under this subsection results in sustained production of oil or gas from a reservoir discovered by the exploration well, and notwithstanding that the credit may have been transferred under (g) of this section, 50 percent of the amount of the credit received shall be repaid to the department by the person that received the credit in equal monthly installments over a 10-year period commencing 60 days after the start of sustained production of oil or gas. Whether the exploration well for which a credit is requested under this subsection penetrated and evaluated a prospect in the pre-Tertiary zone and the exploration well resulted in sustained production of oil or gas from a reservoir discovered by the exploration well shall be determined by the commissioner of natural resources and reported to the commissioner. A taxpayer that obtains a credit under this subsection may not claim a tax credit under AS 43.55.023 or another provision in this section for the same exploration expenditure. In this subsection,

After notifying the applicant or claimant, the department may apply the amount by which the department reduced its purchase of a certificate or payment for a refund because of an outstanding liability to satisfy the outstanding liability. Satisfaction of an outstanding liability under this subsection does not affect the applicant’s ability to contest that liability.  The department may enter into contracts or agreements with another department to which the outstanding liability is owed. In this subsection, “outstanding liability” means an amount of tax, interest, penalty, fee, rental, royalty, or other charge for which the state has issued a demand for payment that has not been paid when due and, if contested, has not been finally resolved against the state.

An applicant or claimant that has requested a purchase, refund, or payment by the department from the fund shall provide a notice of interest to the department by the date determined by the commissioner if the applicant or claimant is interested in a purchase, refund, or payment from money disbursed to the commissioner instead. An applicant or claimant that requests a purchase, refund, or payment from the fund on or after July 1, 2018, shall include any notice of interest in a purchase, refund, or payment from money disbursed to the commissioner at the same time that the applicant or claimant requests a purchase, refund, or payment by the department from the fund. The department may not use money disbursed to the commissioner for a purchase, refund, or payment under this section if the applicant or claimant fails to provide the department with a notice of interest in a purchase, refund, or payment from money disbursed to the commissioner. A notice of interest for a purchase, refund, or payment from money disbursed to the commissioner must include all of the requests for purchases, refunds, or payments made by the applicant or claimant and, if applicable, a statement indicating whether the applicant intends to meet a condition in (m)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. An applicant or claimant may not include in a notice of interest a request for purchase, refund, or payment from the fund if the request could have been included in a previous notice of interest under this subsection.

       The department shall calculate the maximum amount for a purchase, refund, or payment with money disbursed to the commissioner. The maximum amount for a purchase, refund, or payment is the sum of the assumed payment amounts for purchases, refunds, and payments for each year discounted as provided in (m) of this section. The assumed payment amount for each year is the assumed appropriations to the fund multiplied by the assumed proration amount calculated in this subsection. The assumed appropriation to the fund each year is an amount equal to the percentage provided under (c) of this section of the total taxes levied by  AS 43.55.011 as forecast by the department before the application of tax credits. The assumed proration amount is that proportion of payments the department would have allocated from the fund, if money had not been disbursed to the commissioner, based on the date of the request for purchase, refund, or payment from the fund. When determining the assumed proration amount under this subsection, the department shall

An applicant’s agreement to a discount rate under (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection is only consideration for the amount that the purchase exceeds the amount that would have been purchased in the absence of the agreement. For a refund or claim for payment under  AS 43.20.046,  43.20.047, or  43.20.053, the discount rate is the true interest cost plus 1.5 percent, but may not exceed 10 percent.

       On and after January 1, 2014, in the calculation of an annual production tax value of a producer under (a)(1)(A) or (h)(1) of this section, the gross value at the point of production of oil or gas produced from a lease or property north of 68 degrees North latitude meeting one or more of the following criteria is reduced by 20 percent: (1) the oil or gas is produced from a lease or property that does not contain a lease that was within a unit on January 1, 2003; (2) the oil or gas is produced from a participating area established after December 31, 2011, that is within a unit formed under AS 38.05.180(p) before January 1, 2003, if the participating area does not contain a reservoir that had previously been in a participating area established before December 31, 2011; (3) the oil or gas is produced from acreage that was added to an existing participating area by the Department of Natural Resources on and after January 1, 2014, and the producer demonstrates to the department that the volume of oil or gas produced is from acreage added to an existing participating area. This subsection does not apply to gas produced before 2022 that is used in the state or to gas produced on and after January 1, 2022. For oil and gas first produced from a lease or property after December 31, 2016, a reduction allowed under this subsection applies from the date of commencement of regular production of oil and gas from that lease or property and expires after three years, consecutive or nonconsecutive, in which the average annual price per barrel for Alaska North Slope crude oil for sale on the United States West Coast is more than $70 or after seven years, whichever occurs first. For oil and gas first produced from a lease or property before January 1, 2017, a reduction allowed under this subsection expires on the earlier of January 1, 2023, or January 1 following three years, consecutive or nonconsecutive, in which the average annual price per barrel for Alaska North Slope crude oil for sale on the United States West Coast is more than $70. The Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission shall determine the commencement of regular production of oil and gas for purposes of this subsection. A reduction under this subsection may not reduce the gross value at the point of production below zero. In this subsection, “participating area” means a reservoir or portion of a reservoir producing or contributing to production as approved by the Department of Natural Resources.

       Municipal tax ordinance which established three differential tax zones but levied a higher mill rate in Tax Zone III, a zone consisting entirely of oil and gas property owned by Alyeska and assessed by the State of Alaska, Department of Revenue, under AS 43.56, violated the uniform rate provision of subsection (b). December 8, 1986 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the event that creation of a tax zone consisting entirely of oil and gas property was proper and was thereby taxed at a higher mill rate than other property in the city under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.29.html#t29c45a03s29.45.580" target="_blank">29.45.580</a></cite> because it received different services than those generally provided in the city, the municipality’s collection of the higher tax from Alyeska in 1986 failed to meet the requirement of a rational relationship between the benefits conferred and the costs to the taxpayer in 1986.

       A Department of Revenue regulation, under which all appeals of oil and gas property tax valuation had to be heard by the State Assessment Review Board while appeals of taxability had to be heard by the department, was in error. The Department’s interpretation of
   AS 43.56 was inconsistent with its text, legislative history, and purpose; the interpretation rendered the regulation invalid as it had no reasonable basis in the statute and fell outside of the department’s statutory authority.

       It was not error to determine an assessment based on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System’s use value because this section does not require a “fair market value” assessment. There was no market from which to find fair market value, as the pipeline is a limited-market and special-purpose property, and the use value was not applied to non-system property.

       Distinction that the Department of Revenue assesses all property but then only values taxable property, indicates that the assessment required by subsection (a) necessarily includes a determination that property is taxable under
   AS 43.56; the text of this section thus suggests that the taxability determination is a component of the assessment process, not a determination that precedes the process.

       Statute’s requirement implies that all issues relating to the assessment roll must be resolved at the administrative level by June 1 of each year; this requirement must encompass tax- ability appeals, because an assessment roll is not final if it still contains property whose owners are disputing its taxability in appeal proceedings before the Department of Revenue.

       The clear wording of this section leaves little room for interpretation. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether a tax is actually levied upon the United States or its property in violation of the federal government’s constitutional immunity, the United States Supreme Court has looked to the substance rather than the form of the particular statute in order to determine whether the incident of the tax was on a federal instrumentality. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       An analysis of the substance of this section will only reveal that the liquor excise tax is not imposed on any agency or other instrumentality of the federal government. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska can tax retail liquor stores and beverage dispensaries located within military reservations if they do not fall within the exemptions set forth in 4 USC 107. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 16.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board may regulate the sale of intoxicating beverages on military reservations by businesses which are not instrumentalities of the federal government, may require such businesses to obtain retail store or beverage dispensary licenses, may inspect them to determine if they are operating in compliance with the liquor laws of Alaska (subject to restrictions for security reasons), and may take any action authorized by Alaska liquor statutes if they are not doing business in compliance with state liquor laws and regulations. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 16.
      </p>
      <p>
       Members of the national guard of Alaska enjoy no different status than other civilian residents of Alaska as far as Alaska liquor laws are concerned unless they or their units shall have been called into the active service of the United States. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 16.

       Intoxicating beverages may only be sold or dispensed at a national guard encampment or installation in Alaska by a licensed beverage dispensary or licensed retail liquor store. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 16.

       A person prosecuting or attempting to prosecute, or engaging in the business of mining in the state shall obtain a license from the department. All new mining operations are exempt from the tax levied by this chapter for three and one-half years after production begins.

       Where mining operations are conducted in two or more places by one person the operations are considered a single mining operation and the tax under this chapter is computed upon the aggregate income derived from all the mining operations.  The lessor of a mine operated under a lease is considered to be engaged in mining within this chapter, and the royalties received by the lessor are considered to be the net income of the lessor’s mining operations.  If the lessor receives royalties from more than one mine or mining operation, the tax payable under this chapter by the lessor is computed upon the aggregate royalties received by the lessor from all the mines or mining operations as though they were a single mining operation.

      <li id="t43c65s43.65.010ol1e">
       The allowance for depletion included as an allowable deduction from gross income is a percentage of the gross income from the property during the taxable year, excluding from the gross income an amount equal to the rents or royalties paid by the taxpayer in respect to the property, as follows:

       Deductions that are not directly attributable to particular properties or processes shall be fairly allocated.  To illustrate: If the taxpayer engages in activities in addition to mineral extraction in the state and to ordinary treatment processes, deductions for depreciation, taxes, general expenses, and overhead, which cannot be directly attributed to a specific activity, shall be fairly apportioned between (1) the mineral extraction and ordinary treatment processes, and (2) the additional activities, taking into account the ratio which the operating expenses directly attributable to the mineral extraction and ordinary treatment processes bear to the operating expenses directly attributable to the additional activities.  If more than one mineral property is involved, the deductions apportioned to the mineral extraction and ordinary treatment processes shall, in turn, be fairly apportioned to the several properties taking into account their relative production.

     The Alaska Business License Act is an act providing for a tax measured by gross receipts.
   It is nothing more than that. The statute is a tax statute.
   It has no regulatory features and is not designed to limit the doing of business in Alaska on the basis of any determination of the fitness of the person subject to the tax to engage in his business or profession. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 3.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is nothing in the Alaska Business License Act which is in conflict with any interest of the federal government. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 3.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Alaska Business License Act falls clearly within the ambit of the “Buck Act,” 4 USC 105-110.
   1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 3.

     Gross receipts derived from business done on military reservations are taxable under the Alaska business license tax. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 3.

     Rental receipts for apartments owned by a religious corporation, or any other corporation, because they were “receipts which are the result of a continuous engaging in a business or occupation otherwise subject to this chapter,” were not exempt.

       Subsection (d) of this section of the Alaska Business License Act is clearly regulatory, even though the other provisions of the act are not.
   The rest of the Alaska Business License Act is a revenue raising law and is not designed for purposes of regulation of business. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 27.

       Subsection (d) of this section reaffirms the legislature’s intent to make fulfillment of the bond requirement a condition precedent to acquiring or retaining a business license. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 27.

       Although the Pribilof Islands constitute a special reservation, within the meaning of the Buck Act, 4 USC 105-110, the operations of businesses, including performing contractors’ work for the federal government, are not exempt from state taxation. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 22.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mere contracts between private persons or corporations and the United States do not necessarily render the former essential governmental agencies and confer upon them freedom from state taxation. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 22.
      </p>
      <p>
       The principle of immunity from state and local taxation is generally based upon the direct ownership or use and control of the property by the United States, and does not extend to the business, property, or income of contractors who are doing work for the federal government for the purpose of gain. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 22.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where most of the business activities of a company took place in Missouri, it being very difficult to directly allocate that portion of the company’s profits or income which was derived from its Alaska operations, the company carried on enough activities in Alaska to become subject to state taxation and these activities could be taxed on an indirect allocation formula. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 22.
      </p>
      <p>
       Persons receiving in excess of $1500 gross per year from the supplying of part of their home to others and who claim business deductions on their Alaska income tax return for that same part of their home are required to obtain an Alaska business license. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 20.
      </p>
      <p>
       When an individual claims that part of his property is business property for income tax purposes, that same part of his property does not come within the meaning of the words “personal home” in §§ 1 and 15 of the business license regulations. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 20.
      </p>
      <p>
       An individual may not claim a reduction of state income tax on the grounds that part of his home is business property and then escape the state business license tax on the basis that the same part of his home is not a business property but his personal home. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 20.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rents received by religious corporations are not exempted from the Alaska business license tax. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 25.

       Instead of a license issued under (a) of this section, the department may issue a direct marketing fisheries business license to a licensed commercial fisherman who processes fishery resources caught using a vessel that does not exceed 65 feet in overall length and is owned or leased by the commercial fisherman. The licensee may place into commerce in the state and outside of the state processed or unprocessed fishery resources caught using the vessel described in the license. Fishery resources that are caught using the vessel and owned by the licensee from the time of harvest through sale, as defined by the department by regulation, may be processed by the licensee on the vessel, at a shore-based facility, or by means of custom processing services obtained by the licensee. An application for a direct marketing fisheries business license shall be filed with the department and accompanied by an annual fee of $25. A separate direct marketing fisheries business license and annual license fee are required for each vessel on which processing is performed. The application must state the name and address of the applicant, the fishery resources for which the applicant holds a commercial fishing entry permit or interim-use permit or quota share, a description of the vessel and each shore-based facility where the applicant will process fishery resources, and other information that the department prescribes by regulation. The application must state that the applicant, as a condition of obtaining and maintaining the license, agrees to pay the taxes, assessment, employment security contributions, and penalties as set out in (a)(1) — (5) of this section. A person who holds a direct marketing fisheries business license may not under that license (1) purchase fishery resources for resale or processing for sale; or (2) process fishery resources for another licensed commercial fisherman or for a fisheries business licensed under this chapter. In this subsection, “licensed commercial fisherman” means a natural person who holds a commercial fishing entry permit or interim-use permit issued under AS 16.43 or a quota share issued under federal law.

The return must show the license number and must be signed by the taxpayer or an authorized agent, under penalty of unsworn falsification in the second degree. If a receiver, trustee, or assign is operating the property or business, that person shall file the return for the person. A tax due on the basis of such a return shall be collected in the same manner as if collected from the person of whose business the receiver, trustee, or assign has custody and control.

      A person subject to taxes under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c75a02s43.75.100" target="_self">43.75.100</a></cite> shall make a return stating the value of fisheries resources taken, purchased, or otherwise acquired during the license year for sale to fisheries businesses outside of the taxing jurisdiction of the state computed as required by AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c75a02s43.75.100" target="_self">43.75.100</a></cite>, and other information to carry out the provisions of AS 43.75.100 as may be prescribed by the department. The return must contain the license number and must be signed by the taxpayer or an authorized agent, under penalty of unsworn falsification in the second degree. If a receiver, trustee, or assign is operating the property or business, that person shall make the return for the person. A tax due on the basis of such return shall be collected in the same manner as if collected from the person of whose business the receiver, trustee, or assign has custody and control. The requirements for time and place of payment of tax, and the obligation to keep records and make the records available to the commissioner are the same as those prescribed in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c75a01s43.75.011" target="_self">43.75.011</a></cite> — <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c75a01s43.75.050" target="_self">43.75.050</a></cite>.

         the terms should, in conjunction with other factors such as cost reduction of the project, cost overrun risk reduction of the project, increased fiscal certainty, and successful marketing, improve the competitiveness of the approved qualified project in relation to other development efforts aimed at supplying the same market;

         the state’s and affected municipalities’ combined share of the economic rent of the approved qualified project under the contract should be relatively progressive; that is, the state’s and affected municipalities’ combined annual share of the economic rent of the approved qualified project generally should not increase when there are decreases in project profitability, or decrease when there are increases in project profitability;

        <li id="t43c82a03s43.82.210ol1b6">

All rents, royalties, profits, and other revenues or proceeds derived from property interests are taxable to the same extent as these revenues or proceeds are taxable when received by a non-native individual or corporation.  In § 21(d) of the federal Act, the exemption of real property interests from local real property taxes includes exemption from local assessments and extends to land received in an exchange under § 22(f) of the federal Act or  AS 38.50.
