      Chapter 50 SLA 1959 implemented the constitution by providing for the establishment of the supreme and superior court system under the constitution.
      It was designed to accomplish the transfer of judicial functions within the three-year transition period contemplated by the Statehood Act, P.L. 85-508, July 7, 1958, with provision being made for a more rapid transfer if the President sooner ended the jurisdiction of the territorial court by executive order.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chapter 151 SLA 1959 was enacted amending ch. 50 SLA 1959 to provide for an earlier assumption of appellate jurisdiction by the supreme court if the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals should decline to review cases coming up from the territorial courts.
      In Parker v. McCarrey, 268 F.2d 907 (9th Cir. 1959), decided on June 5, 1959, the 9th Circuit held that it did not have jurisdiction to hear appeals from the territorial courts on judgments rendered after January 3, 1959. Accordingly the justices of the supreme court were appointed in August and September of 1959, rules were promulgated, and the supreme court officially assumed its appellate jurisdiction over the interim courts on October 5, 1959.

       Supreme court did not have jurisdiction to directly review an arrestee's criminal convictions as a part of his civil appeal because the arrestee had a right of appeal to the court of appeals or superior court, but he could not appeal his criminal convictions to the supreme court as a matter of right.

      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) of this section provides for an appeal to the supreme court from civil actions commenced in the superior court, but it draws no distinctions between judgments which are adverse because a party has been required to pay money for costs and attorney’s fees and those which are adverse because a party has been required to pay money as damages.
       In each case, an appeal is a matter of right. La Moureaux v. Totem Ocean Trailer Express, 651 P.2d 839 (Alaska 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a testing facility had closed down and stopped serving patients due to an injunction issued by lower court by the time of its appeal, the facility’s appeal was not moot because trial court had entered an award of attorney fees against it, and under subsection (b), the facility could appeal as of right. Bridges v. Banner Health, 201 P.3d 484 (Alaska 2008), modified, — P.3d — (Alaska 2009).

       This section is a clear manifestation of the legislature’s intent that the supreme court would be able to exercise its final appellate jurisdiction other than by appeal. State v. Browder, 486 P.2d 925 (Alaska 1971).

       Where the son helped the father obtain a bank loan, the trial court awarded judgment in 2005 in favor of the son for specific performance of their separate contract regarding the bank loan; the father’s 2006 appeal of that judgment was dismissed for failure to prosecute under Alaska R. App. P. 511.5. Because he only had one right of appeal under this section, the father could not raise the same claims on appeal of a 2007 judgment ordering a writ of execution. Wagner v.

       The supreme court has in the past interpreted a memorandum opinion as a “final judgment” for purposes of appeal where such opinion clearly evidences the judge’s intent to presently and finally dispose of the matter pending before him. Breese v. Smith, 501 P.2d 159 (Alaska 1972).

       Where, in a case to determine the right of a student to choose his own hairstyle, the superior court did more than merely dissolve an outstanding temporary restraining order enjoining defendant school officials from denying plaintiff student permission to attend classes but also considered the parties’ claims and evidence, balanced the competing interest in favor of the orderly management of schools, held that the administrative hair length regulation in question was a “reasonable regulation,” and rendered judgment in favor of defendant principal and the school board, the superior court, manifested its intention to finally dispose of the student’s claim for relief.
       Therefore, the supreme court possessed appellate jurisdiction in the case. Breese v. Smith, 501 P.2d 159 (Alaska 1972).

       </p>
       <p>
        Review of nonappealable orders or decisions will be granted when the sound policy of permitting most trials to run their course uninterrupted by piecemeal review of litigation is outweighed by the need for more immediate justice. Hanby v. State, 479 P.2d 486 (Alaska 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to be granted review of a nonappealable order, the case usually must pose an important question, and that question must demand an immediate answer. Hanby v. State, 479 P.2d 486 (Alaska 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        On occasion, cases nonappealable for one reason or another, which had been erroneously appealed, have been treated as petitions for review in order to prevent hardship and injustice. Hanby v. State, 479 P.2d 486 (Alaska 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Review of a nonappealable decision was granted in the instant case because of threats posed to freedom of expression, the importance of the issues presented, the conclusive disposition review would have upon the case, the certainty of the law on the questions presented, and the lack of issues of fact relevant to the questions of law presented for review.

        Appellate concurring opinion identifying potential problems with the State’s case did not entitle defendant to re-open an appeal because (1) the issues were preserved in the trial court and raised in the statement of points on appeal, so appellate counsel’s failure to brief the issues was not due to oversight or neglect, and the issues were knowingly waived, and (2) the issues did not raise a defect in the appellate court’s subject- matter jurisdiction, as the issues had nothing to do with the court’s subject-matter jurisdiction, and, if the issues were jurisdictional, the issues had to be raised in the trial court.

       <p>
        The state is authorized to appeal in criminal cases only to test the sufficiency of the indictment or information. State v. Browder, 486 P.2d 925 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The state has the right to appeal a sentence only if it contends that the sentence imposed was too lenient. State v. Gibson, 543 P.2d 406 (Alaska 1975), overruled, State v. Dunlop, 721 P.2d 604 (Alaska 1986), overruled, State v. Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co., 723 P.2d 76 (Alaska 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Double jeopardy prevents retrial of all persons acquitted in the trial court.
        Only where a guilty verdict rendered in the trial court has been reversed on appeal in the superior court (when that court is acting as an intermediate appellate court) can the state appeal not guilty verdicts to the supreme court. State v. Gibson, 543 P.2d 406 (Alaska 1975), overruled, State v. Dunlop, 721 P.2d 604 (Alaska 1986), overruled, State v. Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co., 723 P.2d 76 (Alaska 1986).

        A post-conviction relief proceeding instituted by the defendant under Alaska Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b) is similar to an independent civil proceeding such as a habeas corpus proceeding for purposes of the state’s ability to appeal, and consequently the state has the right to appeal in this case.

        Prior decision by a three- judge court held it did not have jurisdiction to review a criminal sentence for abuse of discretion. While the current five-judge court had not had the opportunity to rule on that question, a majority of the court was of the opinion that, even if it had the authority, the sentence in the instant case did not demonstrate an abuse of discretion.

        Because defendant's sentence did not exceed two years of imprisonment, she did not have the right to appeal her sentence as excessive to the Court of Appeals of Alaska, and the Court of Appeals did not have jurisdiction to consider her excessive sentence claim. Defendant was required instead to petition the Alaska Supreme Court for discretionary sentence review.

        , limiting the right of sentence appeal of a defendant sentenced to less than two years to serve, does not affect the inherent authority of the judiciary to review sentences nor violate equal protection or due process under the constitution. Rozkydal v. State, 938 P.2d 1091 (Alaska Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>

        Defendant sentenced to less than two years to serve has no right to appeal the sentence, but is entitled to petition the supreme court for review of the sentence under Alaska Rule of Appellate Procedure 215. Rozkydal v. State, 938 P.2d 1091 (Alaska Ct. App. 1997).

        Where defendant claimed that his 2-year sentence was excessive, because defendant’s term of imprisonment did not exceed 2 years, the court had no jurisdiction to decide defendant’s claim, and pursuant to Alaska Rule of Appellate Procedure 215(k), defendant’s excessive sentence claim was referred to the supreme court.

        Because the propriety of defendant’s composite sentence had to be assessed in light of the totality of his conduct and background, the appellate court concluded that it should not review defendant’s misdemeanor sentence when it had no jurisdiction to review the accompanying felony sentence. Richards v. State, 249 P.3d 303 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate court's authority to review any flaws in defendant's sentence was limited because (1) defendant did not appeal the sentence, (2) double jeopardy limited the State's ability to appeal the sentence, and (3) the court could not revise a sentence the State appealed as too lenient. State v. Seigle, 394 P.3d 627 (Alaska Ct. App. 2017).

        Defendant's excessive sentence argument was transferred to the Alaska Supreme Court because, while the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to consider the claim as to a sentence imposed pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant could petition the Supreme Court for discretionary sentence review.

        When the state appeals a sentence on the ground that it is too lenient, the supreme court has jurisdiction to review the sentence pursuant to subsections (b) and (d), and, if it finds that the sentence is too lenient, it may disapprove the sentence, but it has no authority to increase it.

        Alaska Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to hear defendant's appeal of the denial of a suspended imposition of sentence (SIS) because the Court's jurisdiction to review non-term-of-imprisonment sentence appeals regardless of the length of a term of imprisonment included SIS denials, as the opportunity to set a conviction aside upon successfully completing probation made an SIS a unique disposition in which the Court was more likely to recognize error.

      Chapter 50 SLA 1959 implemented the constitution by providing for the establishment of the supreme and superior court system under the constitution.
      It was designed to accomplish the transfer of judicial functions within the three-year transition period contemplated by the Statehood Act, P.L. 85-508, of July 7, 1958, with provision being made for a more rapid transfer if the President sooner ended the jurisdiction of the territorial courts by executive order.
     </p>
     <p>
      In November, 1959, eight superior court judges were appointed.
      On February 20, 1960, the President signed Executive Order No. 10,867, which ended the jurisdiction of the District Court for the Territory of Alaska and proclaimed that the United States District Court for the District of Alaska was prepared to assume the functions imposed upon it.
      Section 31(1) ch 50 SLA 1959 provided that causes might be commenced, filed, and determined in the state courts in each judicial district from the appointment of one or more judges for the district. Although by the terms of § 31(2) the jurisdiction of the state courts was to be nonexclusive until January 3, 1962, the effect of the executive order was to give them the exclusive jurisdiction which they would in any event receive on that date.

       <p>
        It may be stated that the declaratory action is limited to no particular class of cases, and is confined to no special type of litigation.
        Its scope is pervasive.
        If a “case or controversy” is presented, and the requisite elements of jurisdiction are present, then in the absence of statutory prohibition, the court is competent to provide declaratory relief.
        Whether or not such relief will in fact be granted is a matter of judicial discretion.
        But the exercise of this discretion is to be in accordance with established principles, and is to be liberally exercised in achieving the Act’s remedial objectives. Jefferson v. Asplund, 458 P.2d 995 (Alaska 1969).

        The controversy must be definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.
        It must be a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts; and, as it is not essential to the exercise of the judicial power that an injunction be sought, allegations that irreparable injury is threatened are not required.

        Within the boundaries of the standards of this section, the decision as to whether venue will be changed is within the sound discretion of the superior court. Maier v. City of Ketchikan, 403 P.2d 34 (Alaska 1965), overruled, Johnson v. City of Fairbanks, 583 P.2d 181 (Alaska 1978); Oxereok v. State, 611 P.2d 913 (Alaska 1980); Wilson v.

        In making the independent evaluation of the circumstances surrounding trial, the supreme court will accord due deference to the informed discretion of the trial judge and reverse only where it believes that the trial judge has abused discretion in denying the change of venue motion.

        Superior court did not abuse its discretion in a child custody case by denying a mother's motion to change venue in Alaska from Anchorage to Haines because the mother and many of the mother's witnesses planned to appear telephonically from New York regardless of venue, the court agreed to work with the mother regarding e-filing, and the mother's decision to file a New York case delayed the Alaska case and caused the court to develop significant familiarity with the proceedings before ruling on the motion to transfer.

        In a child custody dispute, a mother’s conclusory remarks about a superior court’s alleged bias were insufficient for a change of venue, and the mother failed to specifically describe why the venue was inconvenient for witnesses; however, on remand the superior court would be allowed to reconsider a motion for change of venue because no one connected with the case lived in the forum city, and the superior court judge had retired.

        A motion for change of venue or continuance shall be granted whenever it is determined that, because of the dissemination of potentially prejudicial material, there is a substantial likelihood that, in the absence of such relief, a fair trial by an impartial jury cannot be had.
        A showing of actual prejudice shall not be required. Mallott v. State, 608 P.2d 737 (Alaska 1980); Oxereok v. State, 611 P.2d 913 (Alaska 1980).

        The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in granting a change of venue where the record of the jury voir dire supported his conclusion that the defendant could not obtain an impartial jury in the small town in which the trial was originally scheduled.

         Questions for trial judge. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        A decision whether to grant or deny a change of venue motion depends on the extent to which pretrial publicity is prejudicial and the extent to which the publicity has affected the ability of potential jurors to be fair and impartial. These are questions well suited for evaluation by the trial judge.
        This is especially true where the motion is made or renewed during jury selection. Brown v. State, 601 P.2d 221 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Abuse of discretion. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was extensive pretrial publicity, the nature of the events was highly inflammatory, and there was obvious potential for prejudice, much of which might even be unconscious but no less real, the superior court’s refusal to change venue, after voir dire had revealed that a large number of venire persons were not impartial, amounted to an abuse of discretion. Oxereok v. State, 611 P.2d 913 (Alaska 1980).

        In the absence of “inherently prejudicial pre-trial publicity” so inflammatory that a subsequent trial in that locale would be, or would appear to be, but a hollow formality, the supreme court will not find reversible error merely because the trial judge chose to proceed with voir dire to determine the impact of the publicity.

      A superior court judge is subject to impeachment by the legislature for malfeasance or misfeasance in the performance of official duties.
      Impeachment shall originate in the senate and must be approved by two-thirds vote of its members.
      The motion for impeachment must list fully the basis for the proceeding.
      Trial on impeachment shall be conducted by the house of representatives.
      A supreme court justice designated by the court shall preside at the trial. Concurrence of two-thirds of the members of the house is required for a judgment of impeachment.

      Because the University of Alaska is an instrumentality of the state and membership on its Board of Regents is necessarily an office under the state, a judge may not sit as a regent while holding judicial office. December 27, 1976 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a judge sits as a regent, the judge is not sitting in a representative capacity of the judicial branch or exercising judicial power but rather is exercising certain executive powers of control vested in the regents over the state’s sole institution of higher learning.
      This, the judge may not do pursuant to Alaska Const., art. IV, § 14.

       Since subsection (b) is not directly enforceable by private citizens, a party has no judicial remedy for a judge’s failure to rule timely. Hertz v. Hertz, 847 P.2d 71 (Alaska), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 955, 113 S. Ct. 2453, 124 L. Ed. 2d 669 (U.S. 1993).

       Superior court's failure to resolve the ex-wife's divorce case within six months of trial did not affect the validity of the judgment as this statute was not directly enforceable by private citizens; furthermore, even if the statute were privately enforceable, the wife's failure to show how the delay influenced the superior court's decision would prevent the supreme court from reversing on that ground.

    </p>
    <p>
     Under § 3, ch 24, SLA 1966, “district court” was substituted for “district magistrate court” in this chapter. In implementing § 3, ch. 24, SLA 1966, “district court of the State of Alaska” has in most instances been shortened to “district court,” following the approach of the Alaska Supreme Court in its handling of the magistrate-court district-court name change in the court rules. (See, for example, Supreme Court Order No. 82 and Supreme Court Order No. 101, with appendix.)

       Proper tailoring of notice to the capacities and circumstances of indigent bush defendants requires the communication of substantially more information regarding the methods by which such defendants can respond to a distant lawsuit than is presently imparted. Aguchak v. Montgomery Ward Co., 520 P.2d 1352 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       A notice that fails to inform the indigent bush defendant of the right to file a written pleading is not reasonably calculated to afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. Aguchak v. Montgomery Ward Co., 520 P.2d 1352 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       The summons served upon indigent bush defendants in a small claims action was constitutionally defective because it did not adequately convey the information necessary to their defense against a creditor’s claim.
       The district court’s assumption of personal jurisdiction over the debtors based on such a summons therefore violated the due process rights which inure to the debtors under Alaska Const., art. I, § 7. Aguchak v. Montgomery Ward Co., 520 P.2d 1352 (Alaska 1974).

       No constitutional right of a defendant was violated by a change of venue on motion of the prosecution on the ground that an impartial trial could not be had in the place where defendant had been indicted. United States v. Hoyt, 7 Alaska 276 (D. Alaska 1925).

       Small claims, like other actions in the district courts, are subject to change of venue when the defendant cannot, without unnecessary expense and inconvenience, defend the action in the plaintiff’s chosen forum. Aguchak v. Montgomery Ward Co., 520 P.2d 1352 (Alaska 1974).

        Pre-trial publicity. —

       No change of venue is required when, despite the dissemination of pre-trial publicity, a substantial portion of the prospective jurors have not been exposed to the publicity or, at least, not exposed to its prejudicial aspects. Cheely v. State, 861 P.2d 1168 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).

        Change under paragraph (1). —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In deciding whether to change venue under paragraph (1), the trial court exercises broad discretion and is empowered, in almost all instances, to reserve decision until completion of jury voir dire. Newcomb v. State, 800 P.2d 935 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).

        Waiver of motion. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       When a defendant does not renew his motion to change venue after jury voir dire, the failure to renew the motion is considered to be an apparently deliberate waiver of the motion to change venue. Alexander v. State, 838 P.2d 269 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).

        Refusal to change venue not error. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a number of jurors were familiar with the witnesses in the case, and several jurors were exposed to prejudicial pretrial information, the trial judge did not err in refusing to change venue but was required to exercise extreme diligence, by granting challenges, to select an impartial jury. Nelson v. State, 781 P.2d 994 (Alaska Ct. App. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to change venue in a case involving charges of attempted murder, assault, escape, and weapons offenses, where little of the extensive pretrial publicity was particularly inflammatory or inherently prejudicial and most articles describing the offenses conveyed information undisputed at trial. Newcomb v. State, 800 P.2d 935 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).

      <p>
       There is no conflict between Alaska Const., art. I, § 11, which provides for a jury of 12 in criminal cases but states that the legislature may provide for a jury of not more than 12 nor less than six in courts not of record, and this section, which provides for a jury of six in a district court, since the district court is a court not of record. Lopez v. Anchorage, 597 P.2d 146 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       As used in Alaska Const., art. I, § 11, the phrase “courts not of record” means courts of limited jurisdiction, such as the district court, which have been created by the legislature pursuant to constitutional authority and which the legislature has not seen fit to designate specifically as “courts of record.” Lopez v. Anchorage, 597 P.2d 146 (Alaska 1979).

         Magistrate is “judge”. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        A magistrate is not merely “an assistant” to a district court judge, but presides with full authority over a court of limited jurisdiction, exercising the judicial power vested by Alaska Const., art. IV, § 1.
        Such a person is a “judge” within the meaning of Alaska Const., art. IV, § 4. Buckalew v. Holloway, 604 P.2d 240 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Provision that magistrates serve at pleasure of presiding judge of superior court
        </b>
        in the judicial district for which appointed does not conflict with the requirement of Alaska Const., art. IV, § 4 that judges be “selected . . . for terms prescribed by law,” since with respect to the accountability demanded in this requirement, service “at the pleasure of” constitutes a “term.” Buckalew v. Holloway, 604 P.2d 240 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since magistrates do not campaign, are never accountable to the voting public, and are not appointed by the governor, for a magistrate to serve “at the pleasure of” the presiding superior court judge does not impair the independence of the magistrate to adjudicate cases impartially. Buckalew v. Holloway, 604 P.2d 240 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Providing that magistrates serve “at the pleasure of the presiding judge of the superior court” is clearly designed to achieve an ongoing guarantee of accountability. Buckalew v. Holloway, 604 P.2d 240 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if Alaska Const., art. IV, § 10, which created a commission on judicial qualifications which could recommend to the supreme court that a justice or judge be suspended, removed from office, retired or censured, is applicable to magistrates, it does not restrict the legislature’s authority under Alaska Const., art. IV, § 4 to prescribe that magistrates shall serve at the pleasure of the presiding judge, since at the very least, the removal provisions of art. IV are supplementary to the removal procedure that defines the end of a judge’s term. Buckalew v. Holloway, 604 P.2d 240 (Alaska 1979).

       It is the intention of the legislature that the superior court apply an identical standard in reviewing sentences appealed to it pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Galaktionoff v. State, 486 P.2d 919 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the exercise of its sentence appeal jurisdiction, the superior court’s scope of review is to be identical with that exercised by the supreme court under

        State v. Chaney,
       </i>
       777 P.2d 441 (Alaska 1970).
       The application of this standard to the superior court means that when a sentence is appealed to the superior court, the reviewing judge is to make his or her own examination of the record and must modify the sentence if he is convinced that the district court was clearly mistaken in imposing the sanction it did.

       The fair approach in reviewing sentences is to treat the case as presenting only the crime of which the defendant has been convicted.
       Other offenses, for which guilt has not been established, should not be considered. Galaktionoff v. State, 486 P.2d 919 (Alaska 1971).

       The superior court judge’s estimation of crimes committed but not charged cannot provide support for the affirmance of the sentence. Galaktionoff v. State, 486 P.2d 919 (Alaska 1971).

       The superior court judge gave undue influence and consideration to the district judge’s opportunity to observe the defendant, and, in so doing, the reviewing judge failed to make the requisite full and independent examination of the record with a view to determining if the district judge was clearly mistaken in imposing the sanction he did.

        Superior court did not err in denying a father’s motion for recusal because the record did not support a contention that the trial judge could not be fair; while one of the superior court’s findings appeared to be erroneous, the controlling findings of fact were not, and as a whole, the factual findings did not reflect an abuse of discretion, much less any bias.

        Denial of the ex-husband's motions for recusal were properly denied because the record revealed neither actual bias nor the appearance of bias as the superior court judge did not decide in the ex-wife's favor 100% of the time; throughout the proceedings the superior court judge had taken many reasonable measures to deal equitably with the many post-divorce enforcement issues raised by both parties, including the ex-husband; throughout the proceedings, the superior court judge was careful to ensure that the ex-wife was served properly and able to participate in the proceedings, but those efforts did not indicate any bias against the ex-husband; and the superior court judge's actions did not create an appearance of impropriety.

       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court rejected the argument that the disqualification standards under paragraph (a)(9) are wholly subjective and therefore not amenable to appellate review. Clearly, review is contemplated on a challenge for cause grounded in bias.
        The supreme court’s duty to assure that judicial proceedings comply with due process mandates appellate scrutiny of allegations of bias. Coffey v. State, 585 P.2d 514 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the initial determination under paragraph (a)(9) of this section has been placed in the discretion of the trial judge, that judge’s decision should be given substantial weight. When the judge does not recuse himself or herself, the decision should be reviewable on appeal only if it amounted to an abuse of discretion. Amidon v. State, 604 P.2d 575 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        A judge challenged under paragraph (a)(9) is independently required to consider not only actual impartiality, but also the appearance that is likely to flow from participation in the case at issue. Moreover, the need to consider the appearance of impartiality seems implicit in the language of paragraph (a)(9), for whenever it is predictable that an unmistakable appearance of bias will arise from a judge’s participation in a case, there will be “reason” for concluding that “a fair and impartial decision cannot be given.” Perotti v.

        Trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to recuse himself in a divorce matter when a party, the husband, cited a law review article that mentioned the husband as the head of a group that was critical of a decision of the trial judge; by virtue of holding a judicial office, the trial judge was in a position to render decisions capable of sparking controversy and spirited public comment.

        On appeal from a grant of summary judgment against him for claims based on medical treatment received, the prisoner made various references to judicial bias, but there was no persuasive argument that it was an abuse of discretion for the judge not to have recused himself. The arguments indicated the prisoner was merely displeased with the judge’s interpretations of the law and adverse rulings involving the exclusion of expert affidavits. Hymes v. DeRamus, 222 P.3d 874 (Alaska 2010).

        Judge was not required to recuse himself where a sexual and physical assault victim’s sister lived in the judge’s neighborhood and was a friend of his wife. The judge had very limited contact with the sister and there was no evidence that the judge had discussed the case with the sister. Phillips v. State, 271 P.3d 457 (Alaska Ct. App. 2012).

        Trial judge did not abuse its discretion in denying the husband’s motion for disqualification, as none of the reasons the husband offered to prove the judge was biased fell within the bases for disqualification listed in this section, nor did a review of the record suggest that the judge misapplied the law regarding judicial disqualification. Martin v. Martin, — P.3d — (Alaska Dec. 16, 2015) (memorandum decision).
       </p>
       <p>
        The ex-husband’s motions for recusal were properly denied because the record revealed neither actual bias nor the appearance of bias. The superior court judge did not decide in the ex-wife’s favor all of the time; throughout the proceedings the judge took reasonable measures to deal equitably with the many post-divorce enforcement issues raised by both parties. The judge was careful to ensure that the ex-wife was served properly and able to participate in the proceedings, but those efforts did not indicate any bias against the ex-husband, nor did not create an appearance of impropriety.

        It was not improper for a trial court to send a copy of the court's order denying a father's motion for recusal to opposing counsel in another case in which the father appeared before the trial court because (1) the motion was an ex parte communication not subject to an exception, as filing the motion without notifying counsel in the other case could have given the father a procedural or tactical advantage, and (2) if an exception permitted the motion's consideration ex parte, the court still had to take reasonable steps to notify all opposing counsel promptly of the substance of the communication and give them an opportunity to respond.

        A litigant is entitled to a fair hearing before a tribunal which is disinterested, impartial and unbiased, and a statute which affords that right by providing some means for showing bias or lack of impartiality does not offend the principle of separation of powers of government. Channel Flying v. Bernhardt, 451 P.2d 570 (Alaska 1969).

        This section represents a permissible accommodation of the due process rights of individual litigants and the ability of judges and the judicial system to function efficiently. Hornaday v. Rowland, 674 P.2d 1333 (Alaska 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where no affidavit is necessary, a judge may be disqualified for good cause, bad cause, or no cause at all.
        But where an affidavit is required, the assertion of bias or prejudice under oath is at least some showing or an imputation of the fact that the judge is disqualified, and this is sufficient to save the statute from successful attack on constitutional grounds.

        The main subject matter of the statute is substantive in nature and was within the province of the legislature to deal with. Channel Flying v. Bernhardt, 451 P.2d 570 (Alaska 1969).

        Since the original case is a separate action from the refiled suit, any motions made in the original case cannot be used to establish waiver in the refiled case. Additionally, the actions emphasized by the state are substantively different from those which will constitute waiver under the statute. None of the motions made in the original case concerned the merits of the case: there was no pretrial conference or substantive motion made. Thus, the plaintiff did nothing which would necessitate a finding that he had waived his right to peremptorily disqualify the judge. Beilgard v. State, 896 P.2d 230 (Alaska 1995).

         Obvious purpose of five-day requirement

        is to avoid a waste of judicial time which would result if an affidavit of disqualification were not filed until the day of the trial, because this would mean that the case would have to be continued until another judge could be assigned, and the disqualified judge would probably not be ready at that time to start the trial of another action. Roberts v. State, 458 P.2d 340 (Alaska 1969); Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. State, 498 P.2d 274 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The granting of the five-day period is to allow a party or his attorney an opportunity to investigate the judge to whom the case is assigned and, if necessary, file the requisite affidavit for disqualification, thus avoiding the waste of judicial time which would result if an affidavit for disqualification were not filed until the date of trial, because this would mean that the case would have to be continued until another judge could be assigned and the disqualified judge would not be ready at that time to start the trial of another action.

However, where no showing of divergent interests or other cause was made requiring the judge, in the interests of justice, to grant additional challenges, there is no constitutional right to a peremptory challenge; and to allow each defendant a peremptory challenge would cause great delays and trial scheduling problems, it was not an abuse of discretion to limit the defense to one peremptory challenge.

        Since the challenge could have been exercised at any time within five days of reassignment, even during trial, the failure to do so was a waiver of the right to a peremptory challenge to the trial judge, and it was not error for the court to refuse to grant a continuance of five days to permit appellant to ponder this matter at length.

        Security for release of files. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In cases where the attorney did not terminate the relation, the client cannot compel the attorney, or former attorney, to deliver up papers or documents on which the attorney has a retaining lien, unless the client pays the amount due the attorney, or furnishes adequate security for the payment of what may be due or subsequently found to be due the attorney. Miller v. Paul, 615 P.2d 615 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the adequacy of the lien is not contested, courts have provided for a lien against the eventual proceeds of a lawsuit as security for turning over files in an attorney’s possession. Miller v. Paul, 615 P.2d 615 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining what constitutes adequate security for relinquishment, the trial court should consider a number of factors and set forth the basis for the decision. Miller v. Paul, 615 P.2d 615 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Factors to be weighed in determining what security, if any, should be required for release of files should include, among others (a) whether there was just cause for discharging the attorney; (b) whether the attorney initiated the withdrawal; (c) the client’s ability to provide security or to pay the fee; (d) the importance of the files to the client; (e) the ethical obligations of an attorney; (f) whether the fee is disputed, and, if so, the reasonable amount of any lien to be charged; (g) whether the amount due the attorney is contingent or fixed; and (h) whether part of the sum due is for costs advanced by the attorney which may justify reimbursement before ordering release of the files. Miller v. Paul, 615 P.2d 615 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       A trial court may exercise its discretion in determining whether it is just to require a client’s home to be encumbered as a condition for release of an attorney’s files under certain circumstances.
       However, only in an extreme case would the requirement of encumbering a home be justified.
       Under AS 09.35.090 (now see AS

      The standards for determining incapacity must be sufficiently strict that the judicial retirement system continues to serve as an incentive encouraging judges and justices to continue in state service at least until age 60. Dec. 27, 1982 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The three-person panel appointed by the governor under (c) should probably not include the attorney general or any of his employees since their duties would include defending against a justice’s appeal of an adverse finding. There is no reason why any other state employee who has no personal interest in the outcome could not be appointed to the panel, unless the appointment conflicted with the individual’s duties or with a statute or regulation applicable to that employee. It is suggested that the panel include at least one doctor and one private attorney or former judge or justice. Dec. 27, 1982 Op. Att’y Gen.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Each justice and judge appointed after July 1, 1978, is a member under the judicial retirement system as of the date of the justice’s or judge’s appointment and shall contribute seven percent of the base annual salary received by the justice or judge to the judicial retirement system. Contributions shall be made for all creditable service under this chapter up to a maximum of 15 years. This contribution is made in the form of a deduction from compensation, at the end of each payroll period, and is made even if the compensation paid in cash to the justice or judge is reduced below the minimum prescribed by law. The contributions shall be deducted from the justice’s or judge’s compensation before the computation of applicable federal taxes and shall be treated as employer contributions under 26 U.S.C. 414(h)(2). A member may not have the option of making the payroll deduction directly in cash instead of having the contribution picked up by the employer. Each justice and judge is considered to consent to the deduction from compensation. Payment of compensation less the deduction constitutes a full discharge of all claims and demands for the services rendered by the justice or judge during the period covered by the payment, except as to the benefits provided for under this chapter. The contributions shall be credited to the judicial retirement fund established in accordance with AS

If the surviving spouse dies after the member but before payments to the spouse have begun, the provisions of this subsection apply as if the surviving spouse were the member.

      The Commission on Judicial Conduct shall consist of nine members as follows: three persons who are justices or judges of state courts, elected by the justices and judges of the state courts; three members who have practiced law in this state for 10 years, appointed by the governor from nominations made by the governing body of the organized bar and subject to confirmation by a majority of the members of the legislature in joint session; and three citizens who are not judges, retired judges, or members of the state bar, appointed by the governor and subject to confirmation by a majority of the members of the legislature in joint session. Commission membership terminates if a member ceases to hold the position that qualified that person for appointment. A person may not serve on the commission and on the judicial council simultaneously. A quorum of the commission must include at least one person who is a justice or judge, at least one person appointed by the governor who has practiced law in the state for 10 years, and at least one citizen member who is not a justice, judge, or member of the state bar. The commission shall elect one of its members to serve as chairman for a term prescribed by the commission. A vacancy shall be filled by the appointing power for the remainder of the term.

       Judge’s self-validation of reduced fare tickets through a defunct airline created an appearance of impropriety which warranted the sanction of a private reprimand. In re Inquiry Concerning A Judge, 788 P.2d 716 (Alaska 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the court found no actual impropriety on the part of the judge, a public reprimand was appropriate in light of the substantial harm caused by the appearance of impropriety that he created and the compelling need to foster public confidence in our judicial system’s ability to protect against favoritism.

       During a criminal jury trial arising out of domestic violence allegations, the presiding district court judge passed a note to a state trooper while the judge made a comment about fishing; the note constituted an ex parte communication, and the judge’s comment created the appearance of impropriety. The appearance of impropriety continued when the judge, who had initially recused himself, continued to preside over the matter before declaring a mistrial.

      The Commission’s statutory obligation of confidentiality does not preclude it from sharing confidential information with another state agency if the requesting agency is authorized to have access to the confidential information and the access is consistent with a legitimate purpose, unless the constitutional right to privacy is implicated, and provided that the requesting agency maintains the confidentiality of the information. Jan. 1, 1992 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The statutory change seeking to give the Ombudsman access to confidential records of every state agency will override the Commission’s statutory confidentiality requirement if the ombudsman’s investigation is authorized by the statutes governing his activities, the information sought is reasonably related to that investigation, and the disclosure does not violate the privacy interests of anyone who is protected by the statute. Jan. 1, 1992 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ombudsman was clearly prohibited from obtaining sealed court records, but that protection may not apply to ancillary material. His efforts to review a matter pending before a court could violate his regulation prohibiting him from investigating matters that were subject of a judicial proceeding. Jan. 1, 1992 Op. Att’y Gen.

       A judge is disqualified from acting as a judge, without loss of salary, while there is pending (1) an indictment or an information charging the judge in the United States with a crime punishable as a felony under Alaska or federal law, or (2) a recommendation to the supreme court by the commission for the removal or retirement of the judge.

If the conviction is reversed, suspension terminates, and the judge shall be paid the judge’s salary for the period of suspension. If the judge is suspended and the conviction becomes final, the supreme court shall remove the judge from office.

       On recommendation of the commission, the supreme court may (1) retire a judge for disability that seriously interferes with the performance of duties and that is or may become permanent, and (2) reprimand, publicly or privately censure, or remove a judge for action occurring not more than six years before the commencement of the judge’s current term which constitutes wilful misconduct in the office, wilful and persistent failure to perform duties, habitual intemperance, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, or conduct that brings the judicial office into disrepute. The effective date of retirement under (1) of this subsection is the first day of the month coinciding with or after the date that the supreme court files written notice with the commissioner of administration that the judge was retired for disability. A duplicate copy of the notice shall be filed with the judicial council.

        Supreme court has ultimate authority. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska Const., art. IV, § 10 and subsection (c) unambiguously establish the supreme court of Alaska as the body entrusted with the ultimate dispositive decision in a judicial qualifications matter. In re Hanson, 532 P.2d 303 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        And is to exercise independent judgment in determining sanction. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally considerable weight will be accorded to a given recommendation from the Commission on Judicial Qualifications, if supported by an adequate factual basis. Nevertheless, both § 10, art. IV, of the state constitution and item (2) of subsection (c) clearly establish that the supreme court of Alaska is to exercise its independent judgment in determining as appropriate sanction, if any, as to any recommendation made by the commission. In re Robson, 500 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be tantamount to an abdication of its constitutional and statutory obligations if the supreme court were to automatically adopt the sanction recommendations of the Commission on Judicial Qualifications. In re Robson, 500 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The supreme court’s scope of review in a judicial qualifications proceeding should be that of an independent evaluation of the evidence. In re Hanson, 532 P.2d 303 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>

        Appearance of impropriety. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       During a criminal jury trial arising out of domestic violence allegations, the presiding district court judge passed a note to a state trooper while the judge made a comment about fishing; the note constituted an ex parte communication, and the judge’s comment created the appearance of impropriety. The appearance of impropriety continued when the judge, who had initially recused himself, continued to preside over the matter before declaring a mistrial. In re Cummings, 211 P.3d 1136 (Alaska 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Review of commission recommendation is broader than substantial evidence test. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the discretionary grant to the supreme court under Alaska Const., art. IV, § 10 and item (2) of subsection (c), its review of a particular recommendation by the commission is necessarily broader than the substantial evidence criterion adopted for review of findings of fact made by the commission. In re Robson, 500 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Which is employed in reviewing findings of fact. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the scope of review which the supreme court should exercise in reviewing findings of fact of the Commission on Judicial Qualifications, there is no reason to depart from the substantial evidence test which has heretofore been employed in reviewing matters coming to the supreme court from administrative agencies and other governmental bodies. In re Robson, 500 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1972).

        Duties of supreme court in cases under item (2) of subsection (c). —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In every case concerning the suspension, removal, retirement or censorship of a judge, the supreme court must insure that procedural due process has been accorded the judicial officer proceeded against and that requisite findings of fact have been made and are supported by substantial evidence. The supreme court is further obligated to decide whether the commission’s recommended sanction is justified by the record and is in accord with the objectives of the commission as reflected in the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions. In re Robson, 500 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        No separate hearing on question of appropriateness of sanction. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither considerations of procedural due process nor the rules of procedure of the commission provide for separate hearing on the question of the appropriateness of any given sanction. In re Hanson, 532 P.2d 303 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>

        Censure held appropriate sanction. —

       <b>
        Supreme court sanction decision made of record. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the actions of a judge were serious enough infractions to justify its following the censure recommendation of the Commission on Judicial Qualifications, the supreme court was of the opinion that given the necessity for the creation of such a commission and the need for enforcement of standards of judicial conduct and canons of judicial ethics, these ends were more fully served by making of record its sanction decision. In re Robson, 500 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       By making its sanction part of the public record, the supreme court believed that the public’s confidence would be maintained, both in the workings of the commission and in the ability of the judicial branch of government to insure its continued integrity. In re Robson, 500 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1972).
