      <p>
       The matter of rate discrimination and investigation is such that the commission must be free to weigh the charges and data presented and the costs to the public and the utility, against which a complaint has been brought, to determine whether further proceedings are in the public interest.

      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature intended to grant the commission broad powers to establish “fair and just” rates. Implied within that broad grant of powers is the authority for the commission to declare a rate interim and refundable, so long as the commission provides protection for the interests of both the utility and the public. Far N. Sanitation v. Alaska Pub. Utils. Comm'n, 825 P.2d 867 (Alaska 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the Regulatory Commission of Alaska had the power to do all things necessary or proper to carry out its purposes, it had the authority to interpret a provision in a purchase and sale agreement that related to rate disputes; the parties to the contract were bound by the dispute resolution procedures set forth in their contract.

        Confiscation. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A court may evaluate the showing of confiscation.
       That is, although the process of determining whether a rate is confiscatory involves fact/law determinations which require the special competence of the commission, the ultimate issue in confiscation questions is whether due process will be violated by the continued operation of the rate. United States v. RCA Alaska Communications, Inc., 597 P.2d 489 (Alaska 1979).

        Standard of review of rate-making decisions. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since generally rate-making decisions relate to complex subject matter which requires the particularized knowledge and experience of the rate-making body, the appropriate standard of review is normally whether the administrative body had a reasonable basis for its decision. United States v. RCA Alaska Communications, Inc., 597 P.2d 489 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The following requirements must be met before the superior court can intervene and overrule or modify an order of the Public Utilities Commission affecting utility rates.
       First, the utility must make a serious and substantial showing that the existing rates are so low as to be confiscatory.
       Second, the utility is obligated to show that no date has been set by the commission for a prompt final hearing, and that the existing confiscatory rates are likely to remain in force for an unreasonable period of time before the Public Utilities Commission makes its permanent rate determination.
       Third, the utility must convince the court that without the benefit of being permitted to operate under an interim rate increase, it will face irreparable harm.
       Fourth, the utility is required to demonstrate that if the interim rate relief is granted, the public can be adequately protected. Fifth, the utility must show that “serious” and “substantial” questions are involved in the rate case it has presented. United States v. RCA Alaska Communications, Inc., 597 P.2d 489 (Alaska 1979).

        The standard of review of agency findings of fact
       </b>
       is that they will be set aside if they are not supported by substantial evidence on the whole record. Inherent in this standard is a requirement, in part statutory, that the facts found be based on evidence in the record. City of Fairbanks v. Alaska Pub. Utils. Comm'n, 611 P.2d 493 (Alaska 1980).

        The requirement that the facts found be based on evidence in the record serves three purposes:
       </b>
       First, it helps to ensure that the agency does not make decisions that have no adequate basis in fact; second, it gives opposing parties the opportunity to challenge the agency’s reasoning process and the correctness of the decision; and third, it affords reviewing courts the opportunity to evaluate the decision.

        Commission’s handling of financial information unconstitutional. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The city of Fairbanks and a corporation both sought a certificate of public convenience and necessity to provide telephone service. At the hearing to decide the matter the Alaska public utilities commission staff requested two years’ annual balance sheets and income statements from the corporation; the corporation agreed to supply them to the staff, but requested that they not be divulged to Fairbanks or become part of the record, claiming that they were proprietary and that revealing them could place the corporation at a competitive disadvantage in its telecommunications contracting business. It was a violation of procedural due process to have a commission staff member review the income statements and balance sheets, and, based on that review, testify that the corporation could meet its financial commitments and was financially fit, where the information upon which this determination was based was never placed in the record. City of Fairbanks v. Alaska Pub. Utils. Comm'n, 611 P.2d 493 (Alaska 1980).

       A certificate of public convenience and necessity to a public utility by the Alaska Public Service Commission is not an exclusive, or monopoly, grant to furnish electrical energy within the corporate limits of a city. Chugach Elec. Ass'n v. City of Anchorage, 426 P.2d 1001 (Alaska 1967).

       Where the public utility commission granted two different utility companies rights to serve a particular city and later found that competition between the utilities was not in the public interest and awarded the territory to appellee utility, the appellant utility company had no compensable property interest in its certificate allowing it to operate in the territory, because the public utility commission, as a condition of issuing the certificate, reserved the right to revoke it for good cause.

       The delineation of a service area contained in a certificate of public convenience and necessity does not provide the basis for precluding a municipality from competing, within its own corporate limits, with a certificated utility.

      <p>
       The legislature did not intend, by virtue of its passage of the 1963 amendments to this chapter, that a certificate of public convenience and necessity was to be a monopoly grant in relation to competition from a municipally owned and operated utility.

      <p>
       The Public Service Commissioner’s issuance, to a public utility, of a certificate of public convenience and necessity providing for a service area which encompassed within its territory a city, did not preclude such city from furnishing electrical energy within its own city limits in competition with such public utility’s electrical distribution system.

       When a disgruntled phone subscriber seeks to recover damages for inadequate telephone service which is common to the public, the complaint may properly be referred to the public utilities commission for exercise of primary jurisdiction. When, however, a phone customer alleges that he has suffered from acts or omissions of the utility which result in inadequate service which is different from that provided to the public as a whole, the complaint should be handled as a traditional common-law action, and the superior court should determine the issues in accordance with settled principles of tort liability.

       In a company’s tort suit against a telephone directory publisher for damages allegedly arising from errors in the company’s listings in the telephone directory, tariff explicitly applied only to “Alaska Communications Systems” (ACS), and did not purport to apply to entities with which ACS contracted; thus, under a literal application of the tariff, only ACS was exculpated from liability arising from errors or omissions in its directories; the exculpatory clause in the tariff did not protect the publisher as it was not mentioned either by name or by description in the tariff.

       , a public utility may not, as to rates, grant an unreasonable preference or advantage to any of its customers or subject a customer to an unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage. A public utility may not establish or maintain an unreasonable difference as to rates, either as between localities or between classes of service. A municipally owned utility may offer uniform or identical rates for a public utility service to customers located in different areas within its certificated service area who receive the same class of service. Any uniform or identical rate shall, upon complaint, be subject to review by the commission and may be set aside if shown to be unreasonable.

       A public utility may not directly or indirectly refund, rebate or remit in any manner, or by any device, any portion of the rates and charges or charge, demand, or receive a greater or lesser compensation for its services than is specified in its effective tariff.  A public utility may not extend to any customer any form of contract, agreement, inducement, privilege, or facility, or apply any rule, regulation, or condition of service except such as are extended or applied to all customers under like circumstances.  A public utility may not offer or pay any compensation or consideration or furnish any equipment to secure the installation or adoption of the use of utility service unless it conforms to a tariff approved by the commission, and the compensation, consideration, or equipment is offered to all persons in the same classification using or applying for the public utility service; in determining the reasonableness of such a tariff filed by a public utility the commission shall consider, among other things, evidence of consideration or compensation paid by a competitor, regulated or nonregulated, of the public utility to secure the installation or adoption of the use of the competitor’s service.

        Standard of review. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since generally rate-making decisions relate to complex subject matter which requires the particularized knowledge and experience of the rate-making body, the appropriate standard of review is normally whether the administrative body had a reasonable basis for its decision. United States v. RCA Alaska Communications, Inc., 597 P.2d 489 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The following requirements must be met before the superior court can intervene and overrule or modify an order of the Public Utilities Commission affecting utility rates.
       First, the utility must make a serious and substantial showing that the existing rates are so low as to be confiscatory.
       Second, the utility is obligated to show that no date has been set by the commission for a prompt final hearing, and that the existing confiscatory rates are likely to remain in force for an unreasonable period of time before the Public Utilities Commission makes its permanent rate determination.
       Third, the utility must convince the court that without the benefit of being permitted to operate under an interim rate increase, it will face irreparable harm.
       Fourth, the utility is required to demonstrate that if the interim rate relief is granted, the public can be adequately protected. Fifth, the utility must show that “serious” and “substantial” questions are involved in the rate case it has presented. United States v. RCA Alaska Communications, Inc., 597 P.2d 489 (Alaska 1979).

       The commission may, after providing reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard, ascertain and set the fair value of the whole or any part of the property of a public utility, insofar as it is material to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the commission.  The commission may make revaluations from time to time and ascertain the fair value of all new construction, extensions, and additions to the property of a public utility. If a public utility furnishes more than one classification of utility service the utility shall allocate the investment and expenses associated with the property used and useful in furnishing service among the utility services and it may not solely consider the utility’s total investment and expenses in fixing rates for a particular service.

       In determining the value for rate-making purposes of public utility property used and useful in rendering service to the public, the commission shall be guided by acquisition cost or, if lower, the original cost of the property to the person first devoting it to public service, less accrued depreciation, plus materials and supplies and a reasonable allowance for cash working capital when required.

       For rate-making purposes, indebtedness, debt service, and payments by a regulated public utility to a person having an ownership interest of more than 70 percent in the utility shall be considered to be ownership equity, profits, or dividends except to the extent that there is a clear and convincing showing that

       Superior court had jurisdiction to determine the Regulatory Commission of Alaska's authority to issue its order of interim rates because the order was expressly made a final, appealable order with regard to the line loss docket. Furthermore, the issue was ripe and not moot because the challenge was not to the rates, but to the RCA's authority to address the subject at all. Regulatory Comm'n of Alaska v. Matanuska Elec.

      An electrical utility owned and operated by a regional electrical authority would continue to qualify for the broad exemption from this chapter, available to political subdivisions under subsection (b) of this section once the regional electrical authority had completed its proposed organization as a nonprofit corporation under AS 10.20. June 7, 1976, Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a deregulated utility exceeds the gross annual limit of $325,000 [increased in 1995 to $500,000] specified in subsection (f), and thus fails to be eligible for deregulation, the deregulation exemption ends automatically, and the utility is again subject to economic regulation. December 20, 1988, Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      In order for the commission to effectively provide for an overview of eligibility for statutory exemption from regulation, it should specify the nature and extent of the exemption certified and require the subject utility to submit a report on its annual operating revenues.
      These terms and conditions should be included in the order which certifies the deregulation election results.
      December 20, 1988, Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (r) provides for an exemption from regulation of certain public utilities by the Regulatory Commission of Alaska. It is ambiguous, in that it uses the terms "plant or facility'' and "placed into commercial operation'', but does not define those terms, and it does not make it clear whether or not the entire plant or facility is required to be placed into operation. The better interpretation is that the exemption is applicable to an expansion of a plant or facility that qualified for the exemption, even if it is later expanded, so long as the facility produces less than 65 megawatts of electricity. April 6, 2016 Op. Att'y Gen.

       Regulatory Commission of Alaska’s finding that pipeline owners collected settlement methodology depreciation over a 20-year period did not violate public policy against the use of settlement negotiations in subsequent proceedings involving settling parties. If the commission remained absolutely free to establish any tariff consistent with the Pipeline Act, it could look to the settlement to measure accumulated depreciation for purposes of a rate-based calculation.

      If the commission, upon its own motion or upon complaint, after providing reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, finds that an oil or gas pipeline facility is making or granting an unreasonable preference or advantage to any person or subjecting any person to an unreasonable prejudice or discrimination, the commission may prescribe rules to end the discrimination or the commission may itself prescribe the allocation of the service until it determines the discrimination can be avoided by appropriate rule or agreement.

      Rate regulation scheme not unconstitutional taking. —

    <p>
     The institution of a rate regulation scheme by the Alaska Public Utilities Commission which resulted in lower tariff revenues for an oil pipeline did not constitute an unconstitutional taking of the pipeline’s property where there was no showing that the scheme threatened the pipeline’s financial integrity and the argument that the commission took property when it reduced the utilities rate base was without merit, as the pipeline’s rate base does not constitute property.

      Disparity between intrastate and interstate rates not necessarily unjust discrimination. —

    </p>
    <p>
     In the regulation of public utilities a disparity between interstate rates and intrastate rates does not, by itself, equate to unjust discrimination against interstate commerce. Rather, a finding of unjust discrimination must rest on specific findings based on substantial evidence that demonstrates that the intrastate rates are less than compensatory or insufficient to cover the full cost of service or that they were abnormally low and failed to contribute a fair share of overall revenue.

    <p>
     Since Interstate Commerce Act; former 49 U.S.C. § 2 (now 49 U.S.C. 10741) prohibits unlawful discrimination by common carriers in the setting of utility rates, does not apply to intrastate rates, § 2 does not require the Alaska public utilities commission to allow the owners of a pipeline to get intrastate rates which match interstate rates. There are other provisions under federal law, not relied upon by the utility, which prohibit intrastate rate discrimination. Cook Inlet Pipe Line Co. v. Alaska Pub. Utils. Comm'n, 836 P.2d 343 (Alaska 1992).

       When a tariff filing is made containing an initial or revised rate, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or condition of service the commission may, either upon written complaint or upon its own motion, after reasonable notice, conduct a hearing to determine the reasonableness and propriety of the filing. Pending a hearing the commission may, by order stating the reasons for its action, suspend the operation of the tariff filing for an initial period not longer than six months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect.  If good cause is shown, the commission may suspend the operation of the tariff filing for an additional period not to exceed one year following the end of the initial suspension period. If information on which to base a just and reasonable tariff is lacking or incomplete at the close of the second suspension period, the commission may, during the suspension period and for good cause shown, with or without a hearing, order a further suspension and in such instance shall order the filed rate to be collected, subject to refund of the difference between the filed rate and the final rate, until a final rate can be set.  The commission may order the difference between the temporary rate established under this section and the filed rate to be placed in escrow or secured by bond pending establishment of the final rate.

       An order suspending a tariff filing may be vacated if, after investigation, the commission finds that it is in all respects proper.  Otherwise the commission shall hold a hearing on the suspended filing and issue its order, before the end of the suspension period, granting, denying, or modifying the suspended tariff in whole or in part.  If an initial tariff is suspended, the commission shall establish a reasonable temporary tariff.  The commission may allow the collection of the filed initial tariff, or it may require collection of the temporary tariff.  If the commission allows collection of the filed initial tariff, it shall require the pipeline carrier to place the revenue representing the difference between the filed tariff and the temporary tariff in escrow in a financial institution approved by the commission, and keep accurate accounts of all amounts received, specifying by whom and in whose behalf the amounts are paid.  At the end or vacation of the suspension period the amount, if any, owing to the pipeline carrier from the difference between the temporary tariff and the permanent tariff shall be paid to the pipeline carrier.  The surplus, if any, shall be refunded to the persons in whose behalf the amounts were paid into escrow. Funds may not be released from escrow without the commission’s prior written consent and instructions to the escrow agent. The commission may allow the pipeline carrier, at the carrier’s expense, to substitute a bond or letter of credit in lieu of the escrow requirement.  If the commission requires collection of the temporary tariff, it shall require the shipper to place the revenue representing the difference between the filed initial tariff and the temporary tariff in escrow in a financial institution approved by the commission, and require that accurate accounts similar to those specified above in this section be kept by the carrier and the shipper.

      <p>
       Regulatory Commission of Alaska’s (RCA) use of settlement methodology accelerated depreciation to calculate the year-end 1996 rate base did not violate the prohibition against retroactive ratemaking because the RCA permissibly found that the settlement methodology accelerated depreciation was actually used by the pipeline owners to compute their rates prior to the instant rate challenge; this finding rendered the retroactivity argument untenable, as the RCA did not meddle with prior rates, but simply parsed a highly customized private settlement to determine what portion of past revenues should fairly be allocated to depreciation.

        Use of prior settlement negotiations in administrative proceedings. —

       Regulatory Commission of Alaska’s finding that pipeline owners collected settlement methodology depreciation over a 20-year period did not violate public policy against the use of settlement negotiations in subsequent proceedings involving settling parties. If the commission remained absolutely free to establish any tariff consistent with the Pipeline Act, it could look to the settlement to measure accumulated depreciation for purposes of a rate-based calculation.

       Investigations.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The commission may investigate any matter that affects the cost or quality of transportation of oil or gas in this state by pipeline carriers or affiliated interests or of related services and may ensure compliance by pipeline carriers and their affiliated interests with the provisions of this chapter.
      Investigations may be public, nonpublic, or both. In conducting investigations, the commission may compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of records and testimony before the commission or its designee. In the course of an investigation, the commission may exclude from attendance at the taking of investigative testimony all persons except the person compelled to attend, that person’s attorney, members of the commission or the commission’s staff, and a person authorized to transcribe the proceedings. Following an investigation and after providing reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, the commission may institute proceedings to determine whether unreasonable practices have occurred, whether expenditures have been imprudently incurred, the costs of those practices or expenditures, and whether a pipeline carrier and its affiliated interests are in compliance with this chapter. Following such a determination, the commission shall take appropriate action to ensure that neither the direct nor indirect costs of any unreasonable practices or imprudent expenditures are included in any tariff or rate of a pipeline carrier or are borne by the public or the state.

      Each pipeline carrier shall file with the commission a written appointment of a named permanent resident, which may be a corporation, of this state as its registered agent in this state upon whom service of all notices, regulations, and requests of the commission may be made.
      The appointment shall specify an address in this state of the appointed agent, which address may be changed from time to time by filing a new Alaska address with the commission.
      If a pipeline carrier fails to appoint an agent, service of notices, regulations, and requests may be made by posting a copy in the main office of the commission and filing a copy in the office of the lieutenant governor.

At a minimum, the in-state natural gas pipeline carrier shall publish reasonable public notice in advance of an open season. The notice shall contain the approved recourse tariff, the proposed form of the precedent agreement, the proposed form of the firm transportation service agreement, and other information sufficient to show the proposed route, capacity, operating pressures, in-service date, quality specifications, and other operating conditions that the pipeline carrier determines are relevant to an evaluation of the proposed service. The notice shall also state the methods for awarding capacity set out in the carrier’s recourse tariff and whether presubscription agreements have been executed. An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier shall provide a mechanism for providing additional relevant information requested by potential shippers.

The results made public must include the name of each prospective shipper, the amount of capacity allocated, and the period of commitment. If the carrier determines that the commitments received during the open season are not sufficient to permit the carrier to continue the development or construction of the in-state natural gas pipeline, the corporation shall report that to the commission within 30 days.

       The commission shall review the proposed initial recourse tariff and verify that the proposed terms and conditions of service are not unduly discriminatory. The commission also shall review the supporting cost study provided with an initial recourse tariff filing and verify, taking into consideration the expected risks, that the proposed rate of return on equity is within the range of permissible rates of return as determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in recent decisions related to the construction of natural gas pipelines, that the cost study incorporates a reasonable depreciation methodology and depreciable life, and that the cost study uses a reasonable capital structure.

Pending a hearing the commission may, by order stating the reasons for its action, suspend the operation of the initial recourse tariff for a period not longer than 30 days beyond the time when the initial recourse tariff would otherwise go into effect. An order suspending an initial recourse tariff filing may be vacated if, after investigation, the commission finds that it is in all respects proper. Otherwise, the commission shall hold a hearing on the suspended filing and issue its order, before the end of the suspension period, approving or denying the suspended initial recourse tariff.

       Unless a recourse tariff is denied because it includes a proposed term or condition of service that is unduly discriminatory, includes a proposed rate element that does not comply with (b) of this section, or violates a provision of this chapter, the commission shall approve the initial recourse tariff. If the commission does not issue its ruling within the 90-day period, and the period of suspension, if any, the initial recourse tariff filing shall be considered approved.

After construction or an expansion of the pipeline, and at any time that a carrier files for a revised recourse rate, the carrier shall file a supporting cost study. Notice shall be given by filing with the commission and keeping open for public inspection the revised recourse tariff provisions, which shall plainly indicate the changes to be made in the schedules then in force and the time when the changes will go into effect. The commission may prescribe additional means of giving notice. The commission, for good cause shown, may allow changes to take effect on shorter notice under conditions the commission prescribes by order.

The commission shall verify that the carrier is using the same elements that were last approved by the commission. A proposed recourse tariff with a new or revised term or condition of service that is unduly discriminatory shall be denied. The commission also shall deny a revised tariff rate that does not use the previously approved value of the specified rate element, unless the carrier proves that the new value is just and reasonable. If the commission does not issue its ruling within 90 days, the revised recourse tariff filing shall be considered approved.

If the carrier does not use the correct rate elements in its triennial report, the commission may require the carrier to recalculate and file a corrected report. If, on the date the report described in (a)(2)(C) of this section is delivered, the report reflects that the three-year average actual return on equity exceeds the approved rate of return, the carrier shall, not later than 90 days after the date the report is delivered, deposit an amount equal to the excess in a segregated operating reserve fund. The carrier shall continue to deposit the excess described in this subsection at the times described in this subsection until the amount in the operating reserve fund is equal to 20 percent of the most recent three-year average of the carrier’s annual operating costs. The carrier may use money in the operating reserve fund to offset any shortage in the recovery of operating costs set out in another triennial report. If a deposit will cause the operating reserve fund to exceed 20 percent of the most recent three-year average of the carrier’s annual operating costs, the amount exceeding 20 percent must be used to reduce, on a volumetric basis, the firm transportation service rates for all shippers for the next three-year period.

     <p>
      An agent or employee of a telephone or electric light company may not remove any instrument or meter or disconnect any wire connected to the instrument or meter without notifying the owner, agent, or tenant of the building or room where the instrument or meter is installed.
      A notice in writing of the intention to remove the instrument or meter or to disconnect a wire is sufficient if delivered to the owner, agent, or tenant of the building or room before removal or disconnection, or in case of the absence of the owner, agent, or tenant, either by depositing the notice in the post office with postage prepaid, or by posting in a conspicuous place upon the building or room 24 hours before removal or disconnection.
      An agent or employee of a telephone or electric light company may not enter a building or room to examine, remove, or disconnect an instrument or meter without first announcing the agent’s or employee’s presence to the occupant.
      A person violating this section is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction, is punishable by a fine of not more than $200, or by imprisonment for not more than 30 days, or by both.

       A law enforcement officer is subject to the same penalties as a private citizen who violated the provisions of the statute. Roberts v. State, 453 P.2d 898 (Alaska 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1022, 90 S. Ct. 594, 24 L. Ed. 2d 515 (U.S. 1970).

      <p>
       In regard to evidence obtained by wiretap or other eavesdropping devices being used in court proceedings, this section does not in any way change the existing law of Alaska.
       The admittance or rejection of such evidence is left to case law and the rules governing the admissibility of evidence as interpreted by the court. Roberts v. State, 453 P.2d 898 (Alaska 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1022, 90 S. Ct. 594, 24 L. Ed. 2d 515 (U.S. 1970).

       Subsection (b) of this section deals with the initial acquisition of a message by persons through the interception of the message at any time. The section contemplates an intentional interception. It should be noted that under this section, the interception alone constitutes a prohibited activity. There is no need to prove interception and divulgence, although the latter activity is also prohibited by this section. Roberts v. State, 453 P.2d 898 (Alaska 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1022, 90 S. Ct. 594, 24 L. Ed. 2d 515 (U.S. 1970).

      In 1989 “city” was substituted for “municipality” in two places in this section. When this provision was enacted by sec. 43, ch. 97, SLA 1923, the only municipalities in Alaska were cities. See sec. 1, ch. 97, SLA 1923. Several related provisions enacted at the same time referred only to cities or to city councils. See, e.g., AS

      . When the Alaska Statutes were codified in 1962, the term “city”’ should have been substituted for “municipality” to reflect the enactment of the borough laws in 1961. The 1989 change corrects this oversight.

      Contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff in the action is a defense. However, allowing stock to run at large upon common unfenced range or upon enclosed land owned or in possession of the owner is not contributory negligence.
