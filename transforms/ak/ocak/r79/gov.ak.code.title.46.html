        This chapter is not void for vagueness
       </b>
       under the Alaska and United States constitutions. Stock v. State, 526 P.2d 3 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Owner of a trailer park charged with polluting a stream by channeling raw sewage from the trailer park into the stream failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality of this section; while there may be instances in which the statute could be arbitrarily and capriciously enforced, there was not, on the basis of such mere hypothesis and in the absence of any history of actual arbitrary application, any ground upon which to invalidate the statute. Stock v. State, 526 P.2d 3 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        There can be no doubt of the general frame of operation of this chapter;
       </b>
       no contention can be made that this chapter has a subterfugal purpose or effect of curtailing the exercise of protected political or individual rights to speech, association, privacy, and the like. Stock v. State, 526 P.2d 3 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Adequacy of notice of what acts prohibited. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A statute must give adequate notice to the ordinary citizen of what is prohibited. A statute may be subject to criticism for failure to give adequate notice as to all types of conduct that are punishable, but may still pass muster if there is no question that it applies to the particular offense involved, and the statute may be construed so that, in the future, the type of offenses coming within its purview may reasonably be understood. Stock v. State, 526 P.2d 3 (Alaska 1974).

       <b>
        State as trustee of air quality. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska Legislature has intimated that the State of Alaska acts as trustee with regard to the air just as it does with regard to other natural resources. Kanuk v. State, Dep't of Natural Res., 335 P.3d 1088 (Alaska 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The concern indicated by this chapter
       </b>

       Dredge or fill activities in coastal and fresh water wetlands shoreward to the aquatic vegetation line do result in the disposal of solid waste material into the waters of the state within the meaning of this section and thus, to the extent that these activities are of a commercial or industrial nature, do require a permit from the Department of Environmental Conservation.

       This section requires no more than that the Department of Environmental Conservation allow a 30-day public comment period, and that it fully and completely review those comments on receipt.
   June 11, 1975 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Environmental Conservation cannot issue a waste disposal permit prior to expiration of the 30-day public comment period.
   June 11, 1975 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Department of Environmental Conservation has reviewed and considered all public and agency comments prior to the expiration of the 60-day period, and has also completed the preparation of the permit itself within that period, it would be competent for the department to waive the remainder of the 60-day “pre-commencement” period, and issue the permit at that time.
   June 11, 1975 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public comments received pursuant to subsection (b) of this section function similarly to environmental impact statements for federal agencies contemplating major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the environment. June 11, 1975 Op. Att’y Gen.

   Such an element added to the definition of the offense also criminalizes only that conduct which is serious enough to warrant enforcement and conviction, thus discouraging discriminatory enforcement. Stock v. State, 526 P.2d 3 (Alaska 1974).

       The state has jurisdiction to require permits of government contractors discharging sewage from a federally-owned treatment plant.

       The Department of Environmental Conservation’s regulations concerning on-site water wells and wastewater disposal systems are a legitimate exercise of the department’s police power though the department lacks authority to adjudicate among conflicting future uses of land. The department also has authority under this section to regulate the construction of all (private and public) water wells drawn from a public water source. Sept. 5, 1985 Op. Att’y Gen.

    Civil penalties for discharges of oil.

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t46c03a09s46.03.758ol1a">
       The legislature finds that
       <ol>
        <li id="t46c03a09s46.03.758ol1a1">
         recent information discloses that the discharge of oil may cause significant short and long-term damage to the state’s environment; even minute quantities of oil released to the environment may cause high mortalities among larval and juvenile forms of important commercial species, may affect salmon migration patterns, and may otherwise degrade and diminish the renewable resources of the state;
        </li>
        <li id="t46c03a09s46.03.758ol1a2">
         the exact nature and extent of oil pollution can be neither documented with certainty nor precisely quantified on a spill-by-spill basis; however, in light of the magnitude of harm which may be caused by oil discharges, and the vital importance of commercial, sport, and subsistence fishing, tourism, and the state’s natural abundance and beauty to the economic future of the state and its quality of life, it is the judgment of the legislature that substantial civil penalties should be imposed for the discharge of oil in order to provide a meaningful incentive for the safe handling of oil and to insure that the public does not bear substantial losses from oil pollution for which, because of its subtle, long-term, or unquantifiable nature, compensation would not otherwise be received; and
        </li>
        <li id="t46c03a09s46.03.758ol1a3">
         the handling of oil in large quantities is a hazardous undertaking that poses a significant threat to the economy and environment of the state, which can be substantially reduced only by the taking of rigorous safety precautions involving considerable expense; conversely, persons handling oil in smaller amounts pose a correspondingly lower risk to the economy and environment of the state, and are capable of safe oil handling practices at correspondingly lower costs; in order to provide an incentive that is effective, but not punitive, it is necessary and appropriate that the assessment of civil penalties for discharges of small quantities of oil be left for case-by-case judicial determination, while ensuring, through the penalty provisions of this section, that the handling of oil in large quantities occurs in a manner that will not impair the renewable resources of the state.
        </li>

      <li id="t46c03a09s46.03.758ol1b">
       No later than the 10th day after the convening of the Second Session of the Tenth Alaska Legislature, the department shall submit to the legislature regulations establishing the following schedule of fixed penalties for discharges of oil:

       The schedule shall vary according to the toxicity, degradability and dispersal characteristics of the oil.  The schedule shall also vary according to the sensitivity and productivity of the receiving environment.  Variations under this subsection may be by subcategories of receiving environments, specific receiving environments, or both.  The maximum penalties established in (b) of this section shall apply to discharges in the most sensitive and productive of receiving environments within each category of receiving environment, and the penalty shall decrease for less productive or sensitive receiving environments.

       A person who is found to be liable under any other state law for an unpermitted discharge of crude oil in excess of 18,000 gallons is, in addition to liability for any other penalties or for damages or the cost of containment and cleanup, liable to the state in a civil action for a civil penalty, up to a maximum of $500,000,000, in the amount of
       <ol>
        <li id="t46c03a09s46.03.759ol1a1">

      <li id="t46c03a09s46.03.759ol1b">
       In determining how many gallons of crude oil have been discharged for purposes of assessing a penalty under (a) of this section, the court shall deduct the number of discharged gallons of crude oil that the defendant proves were removed by the defendant from the environment within the first 36 hours after the discharge as a result of a cleanup operation undertaken in conformity with applicable state and federal law. The dispersal of oil through burning, the use of chemical agents, biological additives, or sinking agents, or other means is not considered removal for the purposes of this subsection.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c03a09s46.03.759ol1c">
       Subject to the $500,000,000 maximum set under (a) of this section the court shall assess four times the penalty set out in (a) of this section if the court finds

       Notwithstanding AS 46.03.875, a person liable for civil penalties under this section is not also liable for the discharge of the crude oil under AS 46.03.760(a). A person causing or permitting a discharge of crude oil of 18,000 gallons or less not permitted under applicable state or federal law is liable for that discharge under the penalty provisions of AS 46.03.760(a); however, the court may impose a penalty of less than $500 for the discharge.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c03a09s46.03.759ol1e">
       The court may reduce the penalty imposed under this section if the defendant demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the discharge was caused solely by a negligent act of a third person unless the third person is a person with whom the defendant was found jointly and severally liable for the discharge under other state law.
      </li>

       A person otherwise liable for penalties under this section is not liable if the person demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the discharge occurred solely as a result of

       If, after complying with (b) of this section, the department determines that noncompliance still exists and the violation is subject to a penalty under this section, the department may make a preliminary determination to assess the penalty. The department shall provide notice to the entity of its preliminary determination. The entity may, within 10 days after receiving the notice, request the department to reconsider its decision. If a timely request for reconsideration is made, the department shall reconsider its preliminary determination and may affirm or modify the determination. The department shall notify the entity of the decision. If a timely request for reconsideration is not received or if, after reconsideration, the department determines that a penalty should be assessed, the department may assess the penalty. The department shall provide notice of the assessment and instructions for contesting and appealing the assessment to the entity by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice must inform the entity of the amount of the proposed penalty and that the entity has 45 days within which to file a notice with the department contesting the proposed penalty. If, within 45 days after receiving the notification issued by the department, the entity fails to file a notice contesting the proposed penalty, the proposed penalty is considered a final order.

After an opportunity for a hearing, the department shall issue an order, based upon findings of fact, affirming, modifying, or rescinding the administrative penalty. The order must include notice that the entity may appeal the order to the superior court and the address of the appropriate superior court. The order is the final agency action on the penalty.

       Subsection (g) does not bar a hold harmless agreement between a rural community and the state. However, such a hold harmless agreement probably would not adequately protect the state from liability under subsection (a). Mar. 22, 1991 Op. Att’y Gen.

      <p>
       Where liquefied natural gas (LNG) company proposed to construct a pipeline roughly parallel to the oil line previously constructed, the LNG could use construction camp pads built by the oil company. Contamination occurring prior to any use by the LNG company was the responsibility of the oil company and the state of Alaska. However, if the LNG company used the camp pads without an environmental audit or other precautionary measure, it would become jointly, severally, and strictly liable for all contamination unless it could prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that its contribution to the problem was divisible. Sept. 5, 1991 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The “innocent landowner” defense, both in federal law and in this section, applies to one who would otherwise be an owner potentially responsible party (PRP) who has not caused, could not have foreseen and prevented contamination, or was not aware of the contamination at the time of acquisition, and who does not have a contractual relationship with a party who did cause the contamination. To use the defense the PRP must act responsibly once it comes to know or should know of the contamination. Dec. 1, 1993 Op. Att’y Gen.

       Where a property owner sued his neighbors for starting a fire that destroyed his dog boarding business, testing revealed elevated levels of lead and the Environmental Protection Agency recommended cleanup procedures; the seller of the property where the fire occurred could not be held strictly liable as an “owner” under this section. A pre-fire bill of sale transferred title such that the seller could not be held jointly and severally liable for damages caused by the fire, because she had no ownership interest in the property when the fire occurred.

      <p>
       By use of the word “potentially” in paragraph (19) (now (20)) in prohibiting potentially harmful alterations of water, this chapter prohibits acts which a reasonable person would foresee as creating a substantial risk of making water actually injurious to the statutorily protected interests.

   Such an element added to the definition of the offense also criminalizes only that conduct which is serious enough to warrant enforcement and conviction, thus discouraging discriminatory enforcement. Stock v. State, 526 P.2d 3 (Alaska 1974).

If a contingency plan submitted to the department for approval relies on the services of an oil spill primary response action contractor, the department may not approve the contingency plan unless the primary response action contractor is registered and approved under AS 46.04.035. The contingency plan must provide for the use by the applicant of the best technology that was available at the time the contingency plan was submitted or renewed. The department shall identify the prevention and response technologies that are subject to a best available technology determination. The department may find that any technology meeting the response planning standards in (k) of this section or a prevention performance standard established under AS 46.04.070 is the best available technology. The department may prepare findings and maintain a list of those technologies that are considered the best available.

       A person may not cause or permit the operation of an oil terminal facility in the state unless the person has furnished to the department, and the department has approved, proof of financial ability to respond in damages. Proof of financial responsibility required for a crude oil terminal is $50,000,000 per incident. Proof of financial responsibility required for a noncrude oil terminal is $25, per incident, for each barrel of total noncrude oil storage capacity at the terminal or $1,000,000, whichever is greater, subject to a maximum of $50,000,000. For purposes of this subsection, an oil terminal facility that stores both crude oil and noncrude oil is subject to the financial responsibility requirements applicable to the type of facility that corresponds to the type of oil storage that predominates at the facility. However, if the facility stores more noncrude oil than crude oil, the $25 per incident, per barrel requirement of this subsection applies to each barrel of oil storage capacity at the facility.

       The dollar amounts change on October 1 of each third year according to the percentage change between the index for January of that year and the most recent index used to determine whether to change the dollar amounts.

       If the index is revised, the percentage of change is calculated on the basis of the revised index. If a revision of the index changes the reference base index, a revised reference base index is determined by multiplying the reference base index applicable by the rebasing factor furnished by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the index is superseded, the index referred to in this section is the one represented by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as reflecting most accurately changes in the purchasing power of the dollar for Alaskan consumers.

       The department shall establish by regulation an emission fee rate. The rate shall be set on the basis of dollars per ton of air pollutant emitted. The department shall assess emission fees annually on or before July 1 based on a stationary source’s estimated assessable emissions for the subsequent fiscal year. The department may allow installment payments of assessed emission fees.

       For a stationary source that begins operation during a fiscal year, the department shall prorate the first year’s fee to cover the time period occurring before the next annual payment date. The owner or operator shall pay the initial emission fee upon commencement of lawful stationary source operation unless authorized to pay by installments under (b) of this section. The first year’s emission fee may not duplicate a fee paid by a permittee under AS 44.46.025 for the same emissions units for the same time period. If the fees would otherwise be duplicative, the department shall provide a credit toward the emission fee in the amount of the unused balance of the fee collected under AS 44.46.025. The unused balance to be credited shall be based on prorating the total original fee under AS 44.46.025 for the time period for which an emission fee applies.

In making an apportionment under (f)(6) of this section, the department shall consider factors such as exemptions or reduced rates for small amounts of emissions, limits upon assessable emissions, exempting small business facilities from the costs of the small business assistance program established under AS 46.14.300, air pollution prevention efforts, and other factors that may ensure fair distribution of the costs described under (h) of this section.

       Alaska’s inspection and entry authority meets the requirements of federal law and regulations, and imposes no greater restrictions on the state’s inspection authority than exist under federal law.
   Although the Alaska Constitution contains a broader guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure than the U.S. Constitution, facilities with an operating permit issued under AS 46.14 are closely regulated with little reasonable expectation of privacy, and Alaska’s provisions requiring owners and operators of these facilities to consent to entry and inspection are permissible under the Alaska Constitution.
   Exceptions to the warrant requirement that are available under federal law are also available under state law, and the restrictions on the state’s inspection authority are no greater than under federal law.

       The court takes judicial notice of the fact that Alaska lies westward of the 98th meridian.
   Thus, under federal law, ownership and control of the land under navigable waters is confirmed in the state. Alaska Pub. Easement Def. Fund v. Andrus, 435 F. Supp. 664 (D. Alaska 1977).

   Under the Alaska Constitution and state law, the right to use such waterways is placed in the people of the state. Alaska Pub. Easement Def. Fund v. Andrus, 435 F. Supp. 664 (D. Alaska 1977).

       The commissioner may declare that an appropriator has wholly or partially forfeited an appropriation, and shall revoke the certificate of appropriation in whole or in part if the appropriator voluntarily fails or neglects, without sufficient cause, to make use of all or a part of the appropriated water for a period of five successive years.

       Failure to use beneficially for five successive years all or part of the water granted in a certificate of appropriation raises a rebuttable presumption that the appropriator has abandoned or forfeited the right to use the unused quantity of water and shifts to the appropriator the burden to prove otherwise to the satisfaction of the commissioner.

Employment by a federal, state, or local government agency does not disqualify an individual from appointment as master under this subsection if the court determines that the individual is otherwise impartial and qualified to act as master.

      <p>
       The party states recognize that low-level radioactive wastes are generated by essential activities and services that benefit the citizens of the states.
   It is further recognized that the protection of the health and safety of the citizens of the party states and the most economical management of low-level radioactive wastes can be accomplished through cooperation of the states in minimizing the amount of handling and transportation required to dispose of such wastes and through the cooperation of the states in providing facilities that serve the region.
   It is the policy of the party states to undertake the necessary cooperation to protect the health and safety of the citizens of the party states and to provide for the most economical management of low-level radioactive wastes on a continuing basis. It is the purpose of this compact to provide the means for such a cooperative effort among the party states so that the protection of the citizens of the states and the maintenance of the viability of the states’ economies will be enhanced while sharing the responsibilities of radioactive low-level waste management.

        Article III. Regulatory Practices.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Each party state agrees to adopt practices which will require low-level waste shipments originating within its borders and destined for a facility within another party state to conform to the applicable packaging and transportation requirements and regulations of the host state.
   Those practices must include:
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        (1)
       </b>
       maintaining an inventory of all generators within the state that have shipped or expect to ship low-level waste to facilities in another party state;
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        (2)
       </b>
       periodic unannounced inspection of the premises of such generators and the waste management activities on them;
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        (3)
       </b>
       authorization of the containers in which such waste may be shipped, and a requirement that generators use only that type of container authorized by the state;
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        (4)
       </b>
       assurance that inspections of the carriers which transport such waste are conducted by proper authorities, and appropriate enforcement action taken for violation;
      </p>
      <p>
       Each party state may impose fees upon generators and shippers to recover the cost of the inspections and other practices under this article.
   Nothing in this section limits any party state’s authority to impose additional or more stringent standards on generators or carriers than those required under this paragraph.

        Article IV. Regional Facilities.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        (1)
       </b>
       Facilities located in any party state, other than facilities established or maintained by individual low-level waste generators for the management of their own low-level waste, shall accept low-level waste generated in any party state if that waste has been packaged and transported according to applicable laws and regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        (2)
       </b>
       No facility located in any party state may accept low-level waste generated outside of the region comprised of the party states, except as provided in article V.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        (3)
       </b>
       Until paragraph (2) of this article takes effect, facilities located in any party state may accept low-level waste generated outside of any of the party states only if that waste is accompanied by a certificate of compliance issued by an official of the state in which the waste shipment originated. Such a certificate must be in the form required by the host state, and must contain at least the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        (4)
       </b>
       Each party state shall cooperate with the other party states in determining the appropriate site of any facility that might be required within the region comprised of the party states, in order to maximize public health and safety while minimizing the use of one party state as the host of such facilities on a permanent basis.
   Each party state further agrees that decisions regarding low-level waste management facilities in their region will be reached through a good-faith process which takes into account the burdens borne by each of the party states as well as the benefits each has received.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        (5)
       </b>
       The party states recognize that the issue of hazardous chemical waste management is similar in many respects to that of low-level waste management. Therefore, in consideration of the State of Washington allowing access to its low-level waste disposal facility by generators in other party states, party states such as Oregon and Idaho which host hazardous chemical waste disposal facilities will allow access to such facilities by generators within other party states.
   Nothing in this compact prevents any party state from limiting the nature and type of hazardous chemical or low-level wastes to be accepted at facilities within its borders or from ordering the closure of such facilities, so long as that action by a host state is applied equally to all generators within the region comprised of the party states.

      <p>
       The governor of each party state shall designate one official of that state as the person responsible for administration of this compact.
   The officials so designated comprise the Northwest Low-level Waste Compact Committee.
   The committee shall meet as required to consider matters arising under this compact.
   The parties shall inform the committee of existing regulations concerning low-level waste management in their states, and shall afford all parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any proposed modifications in those regulations. Notwithstanding any provision of article IV to the contrary, the committee may enter into arrangements with states, provinces, individual generators, or regional compact entities outside the region comprised of the party states for access to facilities on such terms and conditions as the committee considers appropriate.
   However, a two-thirds vote of all members, including the affirmative vote of the member of any party state in which a facility affected by such an arrangement is located, is required for the committee to enter into such an arrangement.
