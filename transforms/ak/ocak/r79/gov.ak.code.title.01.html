       This section, which makes the common law applicable in Alaska, refers to the common law of England.
       It should be noted here that Alaska has the common law of the United States now, some of which is over 300 years old.
       The ancient common law of England is not controlling over the developing common law of this country. Howarth v. Pfeifer, 443 P.2d 39 (Alaska 1968).

      </p>
      <p>
       The common law includes those principles, usages, and rules of action applicable to the government and security of person and property which do not rest for their authority on any express and positive declaration of the will of the legislature; a system of elementary principles and of general judicial truths which are continually expanding with the progress of society, and adapting themselves to the gradual changes of trade and commerce and the mechanic arts and the exigencies and usages of the country.

       Alaska has no law on separate maintenance, but the common law, by this section, has been declared to be in force in Alaska, and a suit for separate maintenance was well known at common law. Moller v. Moller, 66 F. Supp. 507, 11 Alaska 33 (D. Alaska 1946).

      </p>
      <p>
       Given the harsh nature of the remedy of sequestration and the fact that the Alaska legislature has spelled out in some detail the procedure for obtaining other similar remedies while it has not enacted a sequestration statute, the implication is clear that Alaska has decided that sequestration of the nature sought in an action to require a regional corporation organized under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 43 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq., to place certain funds in secure and liquid investments pending litigation is not available and has preempted the common law with a complex statutory scheme.

       Where the legislature has expressly addressed a consideration, such as the relationship between a defendant’s past conduct and his present offense, and imposed limitations on the trial court’s power to consider that relationship in mitigation of sentence, the trial court should not propose the same mitigating factor to a three-judge panel without complying with the limitations; to do so is to suggest a common-law development inconsistent with legislation.

       Application for post-conviction relief was properly dismissed as untimely. Although the prisoner was convicted before the limitation period for filing post conviction relief requests was reduced from two years to eighteen months, the prisoner had several months to file his claim after the amended law came into effect. The retrospective application of the limitation period was specified in the amending legislation, and did not constitute violation of due process under Alaska law.

      Any law heretofore or hereafter enacted by the Alaska legislature which lacks a severability clause shall be construed as though it contained the clause in the following language: “If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this Act and the application to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.”

        Legislative intent. —

      <p>
       This section expresses a general legislative intent in favor of severability, albeit a weak one. Williams v. Zobel, 619 P.2d 422 (Alaska 1980).

        Duty of supreme court to nullify statute or part of statute. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       If a statute is susceptible of no reasonable construction avoiding constitutional problems, the supreme court is under a duty to nullify the statute or, if possible, the particular provision found offensive to the constitution. Bonjour v. Bonjour, 592 P.2d 1233 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>

        There seems to be little or no authority as to the difference between general and specific severability clauses.
       </b>
       Lynden Transp. v. State, 532 P.2d 700 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas a specific severability clause creates a slight presumption in favor of severability, a general clause creates an even weaker presumption.
       For all practical purposes, the difference between the two is negligible. Lynden Transp. v. State, 532 P.2d 700 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        General ruling which states that the invalidation of an exception automatically precludes severability is overbroad.
       </b>
       It remains a question of legislative intent and the rule concerning invalidated exceptions is just another aid in determining that intent. Lynden Transp. v. State, 532 P.2d 700 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The test for determining the severability of a statute is twofold.
       </b>
       A provision will not be deemed severable “unless it appears both that, standing alone, legal effect can be given to it, and that the legislature intended the provision to stand, in case others included in the act and held bad should fall.” Lynden Transp. v. State, 532 P.2d 700 (Alaska 1975); Williams v. Zobel, 619 P.2d 422 (Alaska 1980).

        Severance of initiative provisions. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although neither this section nor any analogous section gives courts the authority to invalidate portions of proposed initiatives, courts should be granted such authority, since circumspect judicial exercise of such power will promote, rather than frustrate, the right of the people to enact laws by initiative. McAlpine v. University of Alaska, 762 P.2d 81 (Alaska 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the requisite number of voters have already subscribed to an initiative, a reviewing court should sever an impermissible portion of the proposed bill when the following conditions are met:
       (1) standing alone, the remainder of the proposed bill can be given legal effect; (2) deleting the impermissible portion would not substantially change the spirit of the measure; and (3) it is evident from the content of the measure and the circumstances surrounding its proposal that the sponsors and subscribers would prefer the measure to stand as altered, rather than to be invalidated in its entirety. McAlpine v. University of Alaska, 762 P.2d 81 (Alaska 1988).

        Statutes enacted simultaneously. —

      <p>
       The fact that two related statutes, one, the permanent fund statute, which contains an explicit non-severability clause, and the other, a tax exemption statute, which does not contain such a clause are enacted simultaneously, may indicate a legislative intent that the latter be severable. Williams v. Zobel, 619 P.2d 422 (Alaska 1980).

       , was sound because constitutionally-flawed procedures could be replaced by jury trial procedures that conformed to the requirements of Blakely and the severability clause of the section without destroying the essential functioning and purpose of Alaska’s presumptive sentencing scheme; the Alaska legislature has retained the basic framework of presumptive sentencing, including the same scheme of aggravating factors and mitigating factors, but with the proviso that many of these aggravating factors are to be litigated to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt under the current AS

       Superior court properly modified a father's child support because "residency" was statutorily defined by focusing on a person's intent; the father affirmatively claimed Alaska residency at trial and intended to return and make Alaska his home, the "tribunal" referred to by statute included both the superior court and the Child Support Services Division, the superior court had evidence before it establishing three relevant time periods based on the father's actual pay that jointly showed his income had changed by more than 15% during the time periods at issue, which both met the threshold for a material change in circumstances and was an appropriate method for calculating support covering past period.

      The statutory framework of the Alaska Statutes viewed as a whole contemplates that for any publicly employed law enforcement officer to be considered a peace officer within the meaning of present paragraph (7), he or she must be empowered with a full range of police duties and authority and must be currently functioning on essentially a full-time basis in that role. September 18, 1977 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Law enforcement officers within the category “peace officers” as used in present paragraph (7) include, but are not limited to, state troopers, fish and wildlife protection officers and police officers employed by police departments of incorporated municipalities. September 18, 1977 Op. Att’y Gen.

      Law enforcement officers with limited police authority with respect to specific statutes or ordinances are not police officers and are not necessarily peace officers either, at least within the meaning of present paragraph (7).

However, the converse of this proposition can never be the case; that is, peace officer status does not automatically vest one with the status of a police officer since peace officers are not necessarily employees of a police department and do not necessarily have the power to enforce all the penal, traffic or highway laws of the state.

      A law may be made retroactive without an immediate effective date; hence, in a law passed in 1989 making itself retroactive to January 1, 1989, the retroactivity provision was valid despite the fact that the effective date was ninety days after approval. On the date the law became effective it was to become retroactive to January 1, 1989. June 1, 1989 Op. Att’y Gen. (overruling March 31, 1988 Op. Att’y Gen. to the extent inconsistent with this conclusion).

       Application for post-conviction relief was properly dismissed as untimely. Although the prisoner was convicted before the limitation period for filing post-conviction relief requests was reduced from two years to eighteen months, the prisoner had several months to file his claim after the amended law came into effect. The retrospective application of the limitation period was not a violation of due process.

        Construction of general saving clause. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that a general saving clause or statute preserves rights and liabilities which have accrued under the act repealed and operates to make applicable in designated situations the law as it existed before the repeal, unless such application is negatived by the express terms or clear implication of a particular repealing act, or where not otherwise provided by the repealing act. Territory of Alaska v. American Can Co., 137 F. Supp. 181, 16 Alaska 71 (D. Alaska 1956), aff'd, 246 F.2d 493, 17 Alaska 280 (9th Cir. Alaska 1957); Alaska Pub. Utils. Comm'n v. Chugach Elec.

       A saving statute preserves rights unless the repealing act reveals an intention not to do so. Brice v. State, Div. of Forest, Land &amp; Water Mgmt., 669 P.2d 1311 (Alaska 1983).
      </p>

       Superior court properly imposed defendants' remaining jail time and refused to honor their rejection of further probation because, even though the original statute was repealed, its special probation requirement remained in force for the purpose of sustaining any prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty or liability, defendants could not reject the special term of probation, and had to serve out their statutorily mandated periods of probation, even though they had no further term of imprisonment remaining from their original sentences where another statute made it a separate crime for sex offenders to violate the conditions of their probation in such a situation.

       Alaska Supreme Court disagrees that the Alaska saving statute is limited to situations where the repeal of a statute would have abated a prosecution at common law; nothing in this language implies that the saving statute only applies to situations where prosecutions would otherwise be barred by operation of common law abatement and the prohibition against ex post facto legislation.
