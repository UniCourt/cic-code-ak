       If an employee produces sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of the work for which the employee was improperly compensated, the burden shifts to the employer to come forward with evidence sufficient to negate the reasonableness of the inference drawn from the employee’s evidence.
       Although this burden of proof in an action under the Alaska Wage and Hour Act is not binding on a bankruptcy court in a proceeding to determine the validity of a claim, it is indicative of the public policy interest that proper records be kept by an employer and that an employee be properly compensated for any overtime worked.

       The award of a penalty under this section is within the sound discretion of the trial court. Klondike Indus. Corp. v. Gibson, 741 P.2d 1161 (Alaska 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Findings by the court that it “does not find in the facts or circumstances of this case that any penalty should be applied” were not sufficient to determine whether its decision not to award penalties against the employer was an abuse of discretion. Lowery v. McMurdie, 944 P.2d 50 (Alaska 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although an employer maintained that its failure to pay an employee's final two days' compensation was not intentional or in bad faith, the court declined to exercise its discretion to waive the penalty and denied summary judgment as to whether the penalty should be imposed and, if so, the amount of such penalty, as the record showed that the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development informed the employer about the wage claim.

       The Alaska Wage and Hour Act does not violate the Commerce Clause as Alaska’s strong interest in protecting the health and efficiency of its work force outweighs the incidental burden on interstate commerce imposed by the required keeping of records for Alaska employees. Dayhoff v. Temsco Helicopters, 848 P.2d 1367 (Alaska 1993), overruled, Buntin v. Schlumberger Tech. Corp., 2021 Alas. LEXIS 47 (Alaska Apr. 23, 2021), overruled in part, Buntin v. Schlumberger Tech.

       When an employee sued a corporation under the Alaska Wage and Hour Act just before the corporation filed for bankruptcy protection, the employee’s veil-piercing claim against the corporation’s president was not part of the corporation’s bankruptcy estate because (1) no corporate injury was alleged, (2) the corporation could not have asserted the claim before filing for bankruptcy, and (3) the bankruptcy trustee could not assert the claim.

      <p>
       Requiring an employee to pay arbitral costs was unenforceable because it was contrary to the policies of the Alaska Wage and Hour Act and was not specific to arbitration; any contract requiring the waiver of substantive rights afforded by the Act may be declared void on that basis, and giving the employer the option on remand to agree that it would be responsible for all of the arbitration costs was preferable to ruling that the case may not be arbitrated.

       Alleged differences between state and federal law did not cause individual issues to predominate and thus did not preclude class certification in an action alleging misclassification of salespeople as exempt employees because this section provides that the exemption for executive, administrative, or professional employees is interpreted the same as under the Fair Labor Standards Act; moreover, because the employees' duties were much the same, common issues would predominate regardless.

      </p>
      <p>
       Summary judgment was improper on employee’s claim that the employer failed to pay overtime compensation, in violation of the Alaska Wage and Hour Act; there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the employee was an administrative or executive worker and the employee asserted that she did not exercise discretion or independent judgment. Hoendermis v. Advanced Physical Therapy, Inc., 251 P.3d 346 (Alaska 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employer raised genuine factual issues sufficient to defeat an employee's motion for summary judgment as to the applicability of the administrative exemption where it provided evidence that she had authority to hire and fire employees, that she had input into discounts offered to corporate customers, that she went on independent sales calls and signed contracts with customers, that she made bids on behalf of her employer, and that she supervised at least one full-time employee at all times, and frequently supervised two full-time employees. However, the employer's motion was denied, as the employee's evidence suggested that the majority of her decisions regarding matters of significance required approval from more senior managers.

       Partial summary judgment for plaintiffs was improper where superior court was obliged to consider district manager’s testimony that restaurant managers such as plaintiffs spent less than 10 percent of their time performing tasks otherwise performed by hourly employees; a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether plaintiffs spent more than 20 percent of their time on duties not directly and closely related to management of the restaurant.

       Applying a four part test, summary judgment was granted in favor of an employer with respect to whether an employee was an exempt executive employee under the FLSA and the Alaska Wage and Hour Act (AWHA) where it was undisputed that she received a salary of at least $455 per week; examining the character of her position as a whole, including her relative salary, the authority she exerted over other employees, and her relative freedom from supervision, the court found that her primary duty was management; she customarily and regularly directed the work of two or more other employees; and she had the authority to hire and fire employees.

       , the court applied the beyond a reasonable doubt standard to the employees' overtime claims under the Alaska Wage and Hour Act (AWHA), and the preponderance of the evidence standard to their FLSA claims. However, in light of the denial of the cross motions for summary judgment and the potential uncertainty regarding the applicable evidentiary standard under the AWHA, the court certified the question of what burden of proof applied to the determination of whether an employee was exempt from the overtime requirements of the AWHA as an executive or administrative employee.

      In the case of pilots, flight crews, and other interstate air carrier employees whose activities are directly and substantially related to the transportation activities of the carrier, and who are covered by a valid existing collective bargaining agreement or agreements with the carrier, the state is precluded from applying its overtime laws due to the preemptive nature of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. §§ 151-188.

      In instances where no collective bargaining agreements apply, crews of interstate air carriers are nonetheless beyond the jurisdiction of state overtime law because of certain commerce clause implications. April 15, 1980, Op. Att’y Gen.

       The Alaska Wage and Hour Act merely requires higher minimum and overtime pay than the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201-219.

      <p>
       Amendment of the Alaska Wage and Hour Act to retroactively exempt pilots from the act’s overtime compensation provision, was an unconstitutional taking of the pilot’s overtime wages under Alaska Const. art. I, § 18, and an unconstitutional impairment of the parties’ employment agreement under Alaska Const. art. I, § 15; because the pilots had already worked the overtime hours, and by law were entitled to receive the compensation for those hours of work at the end of each pay period, the pilots had a vested property right protected by the takings clause. Further, the retroactive removal of existing contract rights from one party in favor of another who clearly violated existing law was manifestly unfair and violated the contracts clause.

      In 1999, “Department of Education” was changed to “Department of Education and Early Development” in (c) of this section in accordance with § 89, ch. 58, SLA 1999.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) was repealed and reenacted by 2014 General Election Ballot Measure No. 3, and in 2015 a comma was added to conform the initiative to the style of the Alaska Statutes, and “Beginning February 24, 2015,” was substituted for “Beginning with the passage of this Act”.
      Subsection (d) was enacted as section 4 of 2014 General Election Ballot Measure No. 3 and was codified in 2014 at which time “(a) of this section” was substituted for “Section 3” in two places.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although, Ballot Measure No. 2 (Initiative 13-MINW), which was enacted at the 2014 general election and repealed and reenacted subsection (a) and enacted subsection (d), provides that an increase in the minimum wage is to take effect January 1, 2015, the Ballot Measure itself did not take effect until February 24, 2015.

      <p>
       The Alaska Wage and Hour Act merely requires higher minimum and overtime pay than the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201-219. Although compliance with both is more expensive than compliance with the federal act, it is not, in any sense, impossible so as to make the Alaska law void. Webster v. Bechtel, Inc., 621 P.2d 890 (Alaska 1980).

       <b>
        Concurrent coverage of minimum wage claims is not preempted
       </b>
       by the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act.
       It appears that 29 U.S.C. § 218(a) was intended to allow the recovery of additional amounts under more protective state laws. It is logical that Congress contemplated that the state would allow for an action as to the whole claim, not just the increment, and, further, that Congress intended that the claims would be brought together, where possible, so that enforcement would not be costly. Webster v. Bechtel, Inc., 621 P.2d 890 (Alaska 1980).

       If an employee produces sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of the work for which the employee was improperly compensated, the burden shifts to the employer to come forward with evidence sufficient to negate the reasonableness of the inference drawn from the employee’s evidence.
       Although this burden of proof in an action under the Alaska Wage and Hour Act is not binding on a bankruptcy court in a proceeding to determine the validity of a claim, it is indicative of the public policy interest that proper records be kept by an employer and that an employee be properly compensated for any overtime worked.

Webster v. Bechtel, Inc., 621 P.2d 890 (Alaska 1980) (decided prior to the 1995 amendment, which among other things, added subsection (d)).

       It appears that 29 U.S.C. § 218(a) was intended to allow the recovery of additional amounts under more protective state laws. It is logical that Congress contemplated that the state would allow for an action as to the whole claim, not just the increment, and, further, that Congress intended that the claims would be brought together, where possible, so that enforcement would not be costly.

       Although it denied an employee the right to participate in a class action suit alleging violations of the Alaska Wage and Hour Act, trial court reserved the plaintiff’s right to sue directly, and, under equitable tolling principles, employee had the full statutory period to file his claim to recover for all of his overtime hours. Fred Meyer of Alaska, Inc. v. Bailey, 100 P.3d 881 (Alaska 2004), overruled in part, Buntin v. Schlumberger Tech. Corp., 487 P.3d 595 (Alaska 2021).

       Policy.

     </h3>
     <p>
      As a guide to the interpretation and application of this chapter, the public policy of the state is declared to be as follows: Economic insecurity due to involuntary unemployment is a serious menace to the health, morals, and welfare of the people of the state. Involuntary unemployment is, therefore, a subject of general interest and concern which requires appropriate action by the legislature to prevent its spread and to lighten its burden and to maintain purchasing power as a factor in stabilizing the economy of the state.
      This can be accomplished by encouraging employers to provide more stable employment and by the systematic accumulation of funds during periods of employment, from which benefits may be paid for periods of involuntary unemployment.
      The legislature, therefore, declares that, in its considered judgment, the public good and the general welfare of the citizens of the state require the enactment of this measure, under the police power of the state, for the operation of public employment service offices and for the establishment of an employment security program to be used for the benefit of eligible unemployed persons.

        Extraordinary and unusual stress. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Because the Alaska Workers’ Compensation Board and Commission failed to consider the character of the sudden, traumatic threat to the employee, the Commission erred in concluding that substantial evidence supported the Board’s finding that the employee’s stress was not “extraordinary and unusual” in comparison to the stresses encountered by other prison guards. Even accepting that prison guards might have been subject to threats, the traumatic death threat that the employee described in detail constituted “extraordinary and unusual” stress. Kelly v.

      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this chapter, the Alaska Employment Security Act, is furthered, in part, by the availability requirement since it ensures that unemployment benefits go to those whose unemployment is truly involuntary; i.e., those who are ready and willing to work if a job becomes available to them. Given this policy, the legislature did not intend to benefit those who have voluntarily limited their ability to obtain work by being unavailable for full-time work. Department of Labor v. Boucher, 581 P.2d 660 (Alaska 1978).

      A pay order drawn on the unemployment benefit account for the payment of unemployment benefits must bear the signature of the commissioner of administration since it would be a warrant within the meaning of subsection (d) of this section.
      July 13, 1966, Op. Att’y Gen. (decided prior to 2004 amendment).
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner does not have to sign with his own hand each check or warrant issued against the benefit account; his signature may be printed on the appropriate check or warrant as it is now in the case of benefit checks.
      July 13, 1966, Op. Att’y Gen. (decided prior to 2004 amendment).
     </p>
     <p>
      It is permissible to affix the signature of the commissioner of administration to the pay order card by means of a rubber validation stamp that would be used by the claims examiner at the time he countersigns for the commissioner of labor and issues the pay order card.

      For each calendar year the department shall maintain separate accounts for each employer and claimant to obtain facts and studies upon which the legislature may determine whether an experience rating system should be adopted to require contributions from employers based upon their experience with unemployment risk, and, if so, the most equitable system for accomplishing this purpose consistent with the solvency of the unemployment compensation fund.

      <p>
       When in 1955 the lien provisions were broadened, it is logical to presume that it was to avoid evasion in payment of taxes; for an employer engaged in business could conceivably nullify the act creating a lien to enforce payment of contributions by using in the operation of his business property belonging to a third person.

      </p>
      <p>
       When the state’s lien was extended in 1955 to cover “property used with the permission of the owner,” the legislature did not expressly provide that this was meant to include property in circumstances where the “use” and “permission” antedated the statute and where the owner of the property, after the enactment of the law, had no practical means of protecting himself against the state’s claim of lien for unpaid taxes.
       In the absence of such express provisions, the statute reasonably may be construed as having a more limited application, so that the state’s lien does not attach to property leased before the 1955 amendment. Territory v. Craig Enters., 355 P.2d 397 (Alaska 1960).

       At the end of each calendar quarter, or at the end of any other period as determined by the department, the department shall bill each government entity, federally recognized tribe, nonprofit organization, or group of nonprofit organizations that has elected to make payments in place of contributions, for benefits paid during the quarter or other prescribed period that are attributable to service in the employ of the government entity, federally recognized tribe, nonprofit organization, or group. In the case of nonprofit organizations and groups of nonprofit organizations, the amount billed is an amount equal to the full amount of regular benefits plus extended benefits that are not reimbursable by the federal government. In the case of a government entity or federally recognized tribe, the amount billed is an amount equal to the full amount of the regular benefits plus the full amount of the extended benefits paid.

       <ol>
        <li id="t23c20a03s23.20.277ol1c1">

       At the end of each taxable year, the department shall determine whether the total of payments for the year made by a nonprofit organization or group of nonprofit organizations is less than, or in excess of, the total amount of regular benefits plus extended benefits not reimbursable by the federal government paid to individuals during the taxable year based on wages attributable to service in the employ of the nonprofit organization or group. In the case of a government entity or federally recognized tribe that has elected to make payments under this section, the department shall determine whether the total of payments for the year is less than, or in excess of, the total amount of regular benefits plus the total amount of extended benefits as determined in this subsection. If total payments for the taxable year are less than the amount so determined, the employer is liable for payment of the unpaid balance to the fund in accordance with (f) of this section. If the total payments exceed the amount so determined for the taxable year, all or part of the excess may, at the discretion of the department, be refunded from the fund or retained in the fund as part of the payments that may be required for the next taxable year.

       Since the Alaska Employment Security Act, AS 23.20, exists in part to provide unemployment benefits to eligible unemployed persons, the purpose and policies of the act are not served by strict application of the time period for filing an appeal in circumstances where a claimant had as little as two days to file a timely appeal; particularly when no apparent prejudice is caused to the department by allowing the appeal.

       The distinctions drawn in the unemployment compensation law between vocational training and academic training are reasonable, not arbitrary, and are fairly and substantially related to their purposes.

       Substantial evidence did not support the administrative law judge’s (ALJ) credibility determination where the ALJ erred in relying on claimant’s receipt of unemployment benefits in making an adverse credibility determination. The record contained no certification by claimant that he was physically and mentally able to work, and the ALJ erred in relying on claimant’s activities of daily living in making an adverse credibility determination.

       (1) that an individual claimant be willing to accept suitable work which he has no good cause for refusing, and (2) that the claimant thereby make himself available to a substantial field of employment. Arndt v. State, Dep't of Labor, 583 P.2d 799 (Alaska 1978).

        Claimant must be available for full-time work

       in order to qualify for unemployment benefits. Department of Labor v. Boucher, 581 P.2d 660 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the testimony as a whole of a claimant for unemployment benefits led the Department of Labor to conclude that the claimant was neither willing nor prepared to find and maintain a full-time job during the period in which she was going to school, because her primary interest was to obtain her beauty operator license in a reasonable amount of time and, at most, she was open to the idea of working a few hours a day, this evidence was sufficient to support the Department of Labor’s conclusion that the claimant was not available for full-time work. Department of Labor v. Boucher, 581 P.2d 660 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of the Alaska Employment Security Act is furthered, in part, by the availability requirement since it ensures that unemployment benefits go to those whose unemployment is truly involuntary; i.e., those who are ready and willing to work if a job becomes available to them.
       Given this policy, the legislature did not intend to benefit those who have voluntarily limited their ability to obtain work by being unavailable for full-time work. Department of Labor v. Boucher, 581 P.2d 660 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Availability for part-time work does not suffice to qualify for unemployment. Sonneman v. Knight, 790 P.2d 702 (Alaska 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimant stated that he would not accept full-time work while in law school but that he would be available for work during hours he was not in school, and he stated that he did not know if he could manage both full-time employment and law school, such evidence sufficed to support a determination that he was not available for full-time work. Sonneman v. Knight, 790 P.2d 702 (Alaska 1990).

       Until a better definition of “labor dispute” is found, or there is some substantial reason for a finding that the legislature had in mind a different meaning to be attached thereto, there would seem to be no impropriety in accepting existing definitions [in Norris-LaGuardia and Wagner Acts] in the determination of what was then meant. Aragon v. Unemployment Compensation Comm'n, 10 Alaska 236 (D. Alaska 1942), rev'd, 149 F.2d 447, 10 Alaska 524 (9th Cir. Alaska 1945).

       The courts of Alaska are not bound by the definition of a labor dispute contained in the federal statutes, but these definitions are at least persuasive of what should be the definition of such a dispute and are not out of line with the general and common acceptation of the meaning of the term.

       Where the act itself does not define the meaning of the term “last employed”, it would seem that the commission could properly construe it to mean in effect “last regularly employed.”
       To do otherwise would open the door to unlimited abuse.
       It would permit a striker to obtain any sort of temporary work and when it was terminated to apply for benefits for the loss of the temporary job even though the work stoppage still continued. Alin v. Alaska Employment Sec. Comm'n, 17 Alaska 607 (D. Alaska 1958).

       Premises leased by a lumber mill operator for the purpose of hiring workers to harvest the timber thereon to be delivered to the mill for processing were considered a place of business for the purpose of unemployment tax liability. Clayton v. State, 598 P.2d 84 (Alaska 1979).

      <p>
       It is evident from the statutory requirement of a showing “to the satisfaction of the department” under paragraph (a)(10) that the Department of Labor is vested with broad discretion in deciding whether an “employment” relationship exists. Clayton v. State, 598 P.2d 84 (Alaska 1979).

      <p>
       Under paragraph (a)(10) of this section, a business proprietor must prove the factors listed in (A), (B) and (C) to win an exemption from the tax. Clayton v. State, 598 P.2d 84 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory definition is controlling, and the employer must show that all three prongs of the “ABC test” in paragraph (a)(10) are met. Tachick Freight Lines v. State, Dep't of Labor, 773 P.2d 451 (Alaska 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an employer could not demonstrate that workers hired for a particular job were customarily entrepreneurs engaged in an independently established business, but that the unavailability of work created unemployment for them, he failed to carry the burden of proof to establish the requirements of subparagraph (a)(10)(C) of this section. Clayton v. State, 598 P.2d 84 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the company’s lease-drivers provided “services,” and did not satisfy the “ABC test” in paragraph (a)(10), the company was not exempt from contribution liability and was, therefore, a liable employer required to make contributions under the Alaska Employment Security Act.

        So-called employers’ liability statutes did not aspire to create any new principle of liability applicable to the employment relation as such.
        The most they ever set out to accomplish was the restoration of the employee to a position no worse than that of a stranger injured by the negligence of the employer or his servants. Haman v. Allied Concrete Prods., 495 P.2d 531 (Alaska 1972).

       Workers’ Compensation Appeals Commission erred in deciding that no penalty could be imposed upon an employer for the bad faith controversion of a prescription for a bed because its construction of the Workers’ Compensation Act was contrary to the Act’s purpose of providing quick, efficient, fair, and predictable delivery of medical benefits to a claimant; the Act permits imposition of a penalty where a medical benefit that has been prescribed but not yet paid.

       While the Alaska Workmen’s Compensation Board is a quasi-judicial agency, the same criteria for judicial review of any administrative action should apply. Hood v. State, Workmen's Comp. Bd., 574 P.2d 811 (Alaska 1978).

       In an occupational disability benefits case, although the Alaska Workers’ Compensation Board (AWCB) found that the employee’s disability was a work related injury, the Anchorage Police and Fire Retirement Board (PFRB) was not in privity with the AWCB; thus, the AWCB’s determination that the employee’s disability claim was work related did not preclude the PFRB’s reconsideration of that issue.

On any matter taken to the commission, the decision of the commission is final and conclusive, unless appealed to the Alaska Supreme Court, and shall stand in lieu of the order of the board from which the appeal was taken.

       Creation of Alaska Workers’ Compensation Appeals Commission was quasi-judicial, and it was properly established; the authority of the commission did not encroach on the judicial branch.

      <p>
       In a case in which a mother sought workers' compensation death benefits or other damages related to her daughter's death, the Workers' Compensation Commission erred in awarding attorney fees to the daughter's employer because the mother's appeal to the Workers' Compensation Commission was not unreasonable or frivolous. Burke v. Raven Elec., Inc., 420 P.3d 1196 (Alaska 2018), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 140 S. Ct. 135, 205 L. Ed. 2d 48 (U.S. 2019).

       Alaska Workers’ Compensation Appeals Commission erred in affirming the decision of the Alaska Workers’ Compensation Board ordering an employee to reimburse his employer for workers’ compensation benefits he received while he was working and directing him to pay his employer’s attorney fees. The employee was not required to pay the employer’s appellate attorney fees for a frivolous appeal where he prevailed on most issues and there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the employee.

      <p>
       Analogizing to Alaska R. App. P. 508(g)(2), a workers’ compensation claimant was a “successful party” under this section for purposes of an attorney’s fee award on appeal to the Alaska Workers’ Compensation Appeals Commission where she obtained the remedy requested. Lewis-Walunga v. Municipality of Anchorage, 249 P.3d 1063 (Alaska 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       In light of the statutory mandate that the successful party in an appeal was entitled to fully compensable and reasonable attorney's fees, the Alaska Workers' Compensation Appeals Commission's decision to award a claimant only half of the claimant's attorney's fees was legal error as the claimant was successful on appeal in that what the claimant obtained through litigation was more than the employer's proposed settlement. Warnke-Green v. Pro-West Contrs., LLC, 440 P.3d 283 (Alaska 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska Workers' Compensation Appeals Commission abused its discretion when it lowered the hourly rate for a claimant's attorney and disallowed one of the attorney's time entries as the Commission did not have an evidentiary basis for doing so. However, the Commission did not abuse its discretion by excluding entries for paralegal supervision because the relevant time entries were vague and did not clearly indicate that the attorney was adding value to the work as opposed to training the attorney's staff. Warnke-Green v. Pro-West Contrs., LLC, 440 P.3d 283 (Alaska 2019).

       Trial court erred in granting summary judgment for an employer in a wrongful death suit brought by the decedent’s estate because genuine issues of material facts remained as to whether the decedent was “on-shift” or “off-shift” when his injury occurred, and there was an issue as to whether the employer authorized the decedent’s use of an ATV.

       is belief in the wisdom of providing, in the most efficient, most dignified, and most certain form, financial and medical benefits for the victims of work-related injuries which an enlightened community would feel obliged to provide.

        Theory of compensation legislation

      <p>
       The principle that inevitable losses to third persons incident to carrying on an enterprise should be included in the costs of operation and, therefore, the burden distributed among those benefited by the enterprise has been recognized by every state in the enactment of workmen’s compensation laws whereby employees may recover compensation for injuries arising out of and in the course of their employment without reference to negligence on the part of employers.
       The costs to the employers are distributed to the public in the price of the product. Fruit v. Schreiner, 502 P.2d 133 (Alaska 1972).

       The chief purpose of the Workmen’s Compensation Law is to do away with the old disputed questions of negligence, assumption of risk, etc., as well as to remove the uncertainty of juries’ findings as to the amount of damages recoverable, and provides that employees injured shall have a specific recovery for specific injuries, and the heirs dependent upon the deceased shall also have a specific compensation.

       Alaska Workers’ Compensation Appeals Commission erred in deciding that an employer rebutted the presumption of compensability because the Alaska Workers’ Compensation Board carefully considered each doctor’s opinion, and it correctly determined that none of the doctors provided substantial evidence of another cause for the employee’s injury; the doctors’ opinions did not show that the employee’s work-related scratch could not have been the entry point for the bacteria that caused the infection.

      <p>
       The Alaska Workers’ Compensation Board had jurisdiction to approve an employee’s settlement despite the fact that the employee also brought a maritime claim against his employer because the Board did not act to enforce or approve a settlement of the maritime claim, but only asked to see that settlement to determine if the employee’s settlement of the employee’s workers’ compensation claim was in the employee’s best interests. Rosales v. Icicle Seafoods, Inc., 316 P.3d 580 (Alaska 2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1004, 134 S. Ct. 1516, 188 L. Ed. 2d 452 (U.S. 2014).

       Form parties used for a global settlement agreement could not expand an agency's jurisdiction, and the statute did not transmute funds paid for a civil settlement into workers' compensation benefits. Seal v. Welty, 477 P.3d 613 (Alaska 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the settlement agreement contained provisions related to the wrongful death claim, the board did not have jurisdiction over all of its aspects; the board only had jurisdiction to dismiss the workers' compensation claim. Seal v. Welty, 477 P.3d 613 (Alaska 2020).

       A permissible way to seek relief from a board-approved compromise and release on the ground it was obtained fraudulently was to petition the board to set aside or modify the compromise and release in the same workers’ compensation case it was intended to resolve.

       The one-year limitation in Rule 60(b), R. Civ.

       Claimant's attempts to set aside the partial settlement or to enforce the putative medical benefits agreement was rejected because the Alaska Workers' Compensation Act foreclosed the possibility of modifying or amending the partial compromise and release agreement based on a mistake of fact; the claimant accepted the money the employer sent him to fulfill its obligation under the agreement; no agreement about the claimant's medical benefits met the administrative requirements that the agreement be in writing and signed by both parties; and any putative agreement about those benefits was void under this statute.

      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska Workers’ Compensation Board did not err by refusing to set aside a settlement agreement between an injured worker and his former employer; substantial evidence in the record supported the Board’s decision that the worker was competent when he signed the compromise and release agreement, because he was represented by counsel and his doctor testified that he was competent.

      <p>
       Res judicata prevented a claimant from setting aside a settlement and reopening his workers' compensation claim where he had a full and fair opportunity to litigate regulatory compliance when the settlement agreement was approved, and the issues of medical stability, the claimant's best interest, and other issues were considered or could have been raised at that time.

       Alaska Workers' Compensation Appeals Commission did not err in deciding that the employee did not substantially comply with this section, as nothing indicated that the employee's counsel ever told the employer about the workers' compensation claim but only told the employer's underinsured motorist carrier about the settlement, which did not necessarily impart knowledge to the employer.

       Alaska Workers' Compensation Appeals Commission (Commission) properly dismissed an employee's appeal of a decision of the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board because the employee (1) offered no argument as to why the Commission erred when dismissing the employee's claim for failure to obtain an employer's required consent to settle a related personal injury case, and (2) did not explain why the employee's appeal was filed late.

       It does not follow from the language of this section, taken in its entirety, that an employee who sues a third party for aggravation of a existing work-related injury forfeits his or her right to all compensation, both for the initial injury and for the aggravation, simply because the employer was excluded from settlement negotiations; such an interpretation would result in a windfall for the employer, and it would also constitute a particularly harsh penalty for an injured worker who would end up paying for what is undoubtedly an attorney’s blunder.

       It may not allocate only a portion of the total fault to the employer. Jury instructions must be carefully prepared to prevent a panel from attributing to the employee any negligence of the employer. Lake v. Construction Mach., 787 P.2d 1027 (Alaska 1990).

       Trial court by giving its own workers' compensation instruction, rather that an airline passenger's preferred instruction on workers' compensation recovery, did not commit reversible error because the court's instruction properly told the jury not to consider any possible workers' compensation benefits that the passenger may have received. The passenger also failed to show prejudice as the jury never reached the issue of damages, and the potential of a double recovery by the passenger was unrelated to the negligence issue the jury addressed.

       Required policy provisions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A policy of a company insuring the payment of compensation under this chapter is considered to contain the provisions set out in this section.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t23c30a01s23.30.030ol11">
       The insurer assumes in full all the obligations to pay physician’s fees, nurse’s charges, hospital services, hospital supplies, medicines, prosthetic devices, transportation charges to the nearest point where adequate medical facilities are available, burial expenses, and compensation or death benefits imposed upon the insured under the provisions of this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c30a01s23.30.030ol12">
       The policy is made subject to the provisions of this chapter and its provisions relative to the liability of the insured employer to pay physician’s fees, nurse’s charges, hospital services, hospital supplies, medicines, prosthetic devices, transportation charges to the nearest point where adequate medical facilities are available, burial expenses, compensation or death benefits to and for said employees or beneficiaries, the acceptance of the liability by the insured employer, the adjustment, trial, and adjudication of claims for the physician’s fees, nurse’s charges, hospital services, hospital supplies, medicines, prosthetic devices, transportation charges to the nearest point where adequate medical facilities are available, burial expenses, compensation or death benefits, and the liability of the insurer to pay the same are considered a part of this policy contract.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c30a01s23.30.030ol13">
       As between the insurer and the employee or the employee’s beneficiaries, notice to or knowledge of the occurrence of the injury on the part of the insured employer is notice or knowledge on the part of the insurer; jurisdiction of the insured employer for the purpose of this chapter is jurisdiction of the insurer; and the insurer, in all things, is bound by and subject to the orders, awards, judgments, and decrees made against the insured employer under this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c30a01s23.30.030ol14">
       The insurer will promptly pay to the person entitled to them the benefits conferred by this chapter, including physician’s fees, nurse’s charges, hospital services, hospital supplies, medicines, prosthetic devices, transportation charges to the nearest point where adequate medical facilities are available, burial expenses, and all installments of compensation or death benefits awarded or agreed upon under this chapter.  The obligation of the insurer is not affected by a default of the insured employer after the injury, or by default in giving a notice required by this policy.  The policy is a direct promise by the insurer to the person entitled to physician’s fees, nurse’s charges, fees for hospital services, charges for medicines, prosthetic devices, transportation charges to the nearest point where adequate medical facilities are available, and hospital supplies, charges for burial, compensation or death benefits, and is enforceable in the name of that person.  The insurer shall provide claims facilities through its own staffed adjusting facilities located within the state, or by independent, licensed, resident adjusters with power to effect settlement within the state.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c30a01s23.30.030ol15">
       A termination of the policy by cancellation is not effective as to the employees of the insured employer covered by it until 20 days after written notice of the termination has been received by the division. If the employer has a contract with the state or a home rule or other political subdivision of the state, and the employer’s policy is cancelled due to nonpayment of a premium, the termination of the policy is not effective as to the employees of the insured employer covered by it until 20 days after written notice of the termination has been received by the contracting agency, and the agency has the option of continuing the payments on behalf of the employer in order to keep the policy in force. If, however, the employer has secured insurance with another insurance carrier, cancellation is effective as of the date of the new coverage.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c30a01s23.30.030ol16">
       All claims for compensation, death benefits, physician’s fees, nurse’s charges, hospital services, hospital supplies, medicines, prosthetic devices, transportation charges to the nearest point where adequate medical facilities are available, and burial expenses may be made directly against either the employer or the insurer, or both, and the order or award of the board may be made against either the employer or the insurer or both.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c30a01s23.30.030ol17">
       If the insurer fails or refuses to pay a final award or judgment (except during the pendency of an appeal) made against it, or its insured, or if it fails or refuses to comply with a provision of this chapter, the director of the division of insurance shall revoke the approval of the policy form, and may not accept further proofs of insurance from it until it has paid the award or judgment or has complied with the violated provision of this chapter, and has resubmitted its policy form and received the approval of the form by the director of the division of insurance.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c30a01s23.30.030ol18">
       An annual insurance premium that exceeds $2,000 may be paid on an installment basis of not fewer than two payments, if requested by the insured. Premiums paid by installment must be structured to reflect seasonal peaks in the basis of the premium. The insurer shall include this provision in the insurance policy in a manner that clearly informs the insured of the provision.

       In a case in which a mother sought workers' compensation death benefits or other damages related to her daughter's death, the Supreme Court held that the Workers' Compensation Act did not violate the mother's rights to equal protection or due process. The legislature has limited the substantive rights available to non-dependent family members of workers who die in work-related accidents, and the claims processing mechanism in the Act provided the mother an opportunity to challenge the constitutionality of the Act with respect to her own rights.

        Origin. —

      <p>
       The Alaska “contractor-under” statute was taken from the text of the federal Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act. Thorsheim v. State, 469 P.2d 383 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Purpose of subsection (a)
       </b>
       is to protect employees of irresponsible and uninsured subcontractors by imposing ultimate liability on the presumably responsible principal contractor, who has it within his power, in choosing subcontractors, to pass upon their responsibility and insist upon appropriate compensation protection for their workers. Thorsheim v. State, 469 P.2d 383 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) aims to forestall evasion of the act by those who might be tempted to subdivide their regular operations among subcontractors, thus escaping direct employment relations with the workers and relegating them for compensation protection to small contractors who fail to carry compensation insurance.

       The most appropriate definition of the term “contractor,” as it is used in subsection (a), is: a person who undertakes, by contract, the performance of certain work for another, including the furnishing of goods and services. Thorsheim v. State, 469 P.2d 383 (Alaska 1970).

       Pipeline operator met the statutory definition of “project owner” where, in the course of its business, it engaged the services of a contractor, which undertook performance of work for the operator; because of its contract with the contractor, the operator did not need to hire its own employees to perform the work done by the contractor. The operator was covered by the exclusivity provisions of this section, and the superior court correctly dismissed the employee’s lawsuit. Anderson v. Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co., 234 P.3d 1282 (Alaska 2010).

       Municipality would not be a “project owner” if it entered into a contract with a vendor whose primary business was leasing equipment. However, subsection (d) would still require it to ensure that the vendor had workers’ compensation coverage; subsections (d) and (f) do not conflict, and the municipality could be a “project owner” under (f)(2).

      <p>
       In a case in which the worker was injured on the job and later filed personal injury lawsuits against two companies, numerous issues of material fact made it impossible to determine whether the companies were entitled to judgment as a matter of law that they were immune from liability because no party asserted or presented evidence that the first company and the direct employer were joint venturers; no party argued or presented evidence establishing that the worker was a general or special employee of the first company; and it was error to speculate that a contractor-subcontractor relationship existed between the two companies, then rely on that to further speculate about the relationship between the first company and the direct employer.

Instead, it engaged in the traditional legislative practice of line drawing and by adopting marriage as the primary criterion for determining when an intimate partner qualifies for benefits, the legislature has determined that legal marriage is an adequate proxy for the more particularized inquiry concerning whether a relationship is serious enough or the partner is sufficiently dependent to justify awarding benefits.

       The only classification in this section is that separating work-related and nonwork-related injuries.

       When an employee claimed various parties conspired to present the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board a video falsely depicting the employee's physical abilities, in an attempt to terminate the employee's workers' compensation benefits, it was error to dismiss the employee's negligent infliction of emotional distress claim because, inter alia, the exclusive remedy provision did not apply to the employer's counsel.

       Because the exclusive remedy provision is related to claims made on account of the injury or death, whether appellant filed the workers' compensation claim as a potential beneficiary or as personal representative of the worker's estate was immaterial; had appellant or the estate received workers' compensation benefits, the estate's wrongful death suit would be barred by the exclusive remedy provision.

       The employer shall furnish medical, surgical, and other attendance or treatment, nurse and hospital service, medicine, crutches, and apparatus for the period which the nature of the injury or the process of recovery requires, not exceeding two years from and after the date of injury to the employee. However, if the condition requiring the treatment, apparatus, or medicine is a latent one, the two-year period runs from the time the employee has knowledge of the nature of the employee’s disability and its relationship to the employment and after disablement.  It shall be additionally provided that, if continued treatment or care or both beyond the two-year period is indicated, the injured employee has the right of review by the board.  The board may authorize continued treatment or care or both as the process of recovery may require. When medical care is required, the injured employee may designate a licensed physician to provide all medical and related benefits. The employee may not make more than one change in the employee’s choice of attending physician without the written consent of the employer. Referral to a specialist by the employee’s attending physician is not considered a change in physicians. Upon procuring the services of a physician, the injured employee shall give proper notification of the selection to the employer within a reasonable time after first being treated. Notice of a change in the attending physician shall be given before the change.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c30a02s23.30.095ol1b">
       If the employee is unable to designate a physician and the emergency nature of the injury requires immediate medical care, or if the employee does not desire to designate a physician and so advises the employer, the employer shall designate the physician.  Designation under this subsection, however, does not prevent the employee from subsequently designating a physician for continuance of required medical care.

       A claim for medical or surgical treatment, or treatment requiring continuing and multiple treatments of a similar nature, is not valid and enforceable against the employer unless, within 14 days following treatment, the physician or health care provider giving the treatment or the employee receiving it furnishes to the employer and the board notice of the injury and treatment, preferably on a form prescribed by the board.  The board shall, however, excuse the failure to furnish notice within 14 days when it finds it to be in the interest of justice to do so, and it may, upon application by a party in interest, make an award for the reasonable value of the medical or surgical treatment so obtained by the employee. When a claim is made for a course of treatment requiring continuing and multiple treatments of a similar nature, in addition to the notice, the physician or health care provider shall furnish a written treatment plan if the course of treatment will require more frequent outpatient visits than the standard treatment frequency for the nature and degree of the injury and the type of treatments. The treatment plan shall be furnished to the employee and the employer within 14 days after treatment begins. The treatment plan must include objectives, modalities, frequency of treatments, and reasons for the frequency of treatments. If the treatment plan is not furnished as required under this subsection, neither the employer nor the employee may be required to pay for treatments that exceed the frequency standard. The board shall adopt regulations establishing standards for frequency of treatment.

       If at any time during the period the employee unreasonably refuses to submit to medical or surgical treatment, the board may by order suspend the payment of further compensation while the refusal continues, and no compensation may be paid at any time during the period of suspension, unless the circumstances justified the refusal.

       The employee shall, after an injury, at reasonable times during the continuance of the disability, if requested by the employer or when ordered by the board, submit to an examination by a physician or surgeon of the employer’s choice authorized to practice medicine under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the examination occurs, furnished and paid for by the employer. The employer may not make more than one change in the employer’s choice of a physician or surgeon without the written consent of the employee. Referral to a specialist by the employer’s physician is not considered a change in physicians. An examination requested by the employer not less than 14 days after injury, and every 60 days thereafter, shall be presumed to be reasonable, and the employee shall submit to the examination without further request or order by the board. Unless medically appropriate, the physician shall use existing diagnostic data to complete the examination. Facts relative to the injury or claim communicated to or otherwise learned by a physician or surgeon who may have attended or examined the employee, or who may have been present at an examination are not privileged, either in the hearings provided for in this chapter or an action to recover damages against an employer who is subject to the compensation provisions of this chapter. If an employee refuses to submit to an examination provided for in this section, the employee’s rights to compensation shall be suspended until the obstruction or refusal ceases, and the employee’s compensation during the period of suspension may, in the discretion of the board or the court determining an action brought for the recovery of damages under this chapter, be forfeited. The board in any case of death may require an autopsy at the expense of the party requesting the autopsy. An autopsy may not be held without notice first being given to the widow or widower or next of kin if they reside in the state or their whereabouts can be reasonably ascertained, of the time and place of the autopsy and reasonable time and opportunity given the widow or widower or next of kin to have a representative present to witness the autopsy. If adequate notice is not given, the findings from the autopsy may be suppressed on motion made to the board or to the superior court, as the case may be.

        Physician’s ability to sue. —

      <p>
       Absent an Alaska Workers’ Compensation Board determination that employee’s injuries were not work related, subsection (f) could well foreclose the physician’s ability to sue employee for payment; by not giving the physician notice of the proposed settlement and opportunity to present his claim, the board denied him the opportunity to show that the medical care he provided was reasonable and necessary and that other medical care was not.

       Employer’s insistence on an independent medical examination of the employee prior to preauthorizing surgery was not in good faith; the employer knew the surgery was needed and the examination was not for the condition related to the surgery. Accordingly, the employee was entitled to attorney fees. Bockus v. First Student Servs., 384 P.3d 801 (Alaska 2016).

       Only where the claimant acquires knowledge of the nature of his disability and its relation to his employment more than two years but less than four years from the date of “injury” could the four-year period apply, but a result allowing a two-year filing period to an applicant who acquired knowledge four or more years after the mishap and a shorter period to an applicant who acquired knowledge in more than two but less than four years would be incongruent with the liberal purposes motivating the latency amendment.

       A disability which becomes apparent immediately upon the occurrence of some mishap will be more quickly barred by the two-year limitation; a disability which does not fall within the actual or chargeable knowledge of the claimant until four years have passed must be treated as a latent defect for which the four-year period is waived by the 1962 amendment.

       Where claimant, who applied on November 30, 1982, for disability benefits as a result of a February, 1982, breakdown, had experienced work-related stress prior to the breakdown, the relevant limitations periods for filing her breakdown-related claim did not begin to run when she began to suffer from work-related stress.

       A disabled worker does not know the “nature” of the disability and the relationship of the disability to the worker’s employment when the worker reasonably but erroneously believes the injury is controlled by medication. Thus, the two year statute of limitations period did not begin to run until the worker discovered that his condition was no longer safely treatable with medication. Leslie Cutting, Inc. v.

       — Because reemployment eligibility was tied to an employee's inability to return to employment at the time of injury, a claimant's termination and the reasons for it were not wholly unrelated to her reemployment claim; thus, the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board erred in its attorney's fees award.

If a party opposes the hearing request, the board or a board designee shall within 30 days of the filing of the opposition conduct a pre-hearing conference and set a hearing date. If opposition is not filed, a hearing shall be scheduled no later than 60 days after the receipt of the hearing request.

After a hearing has been scheduled, the parties may not stipulate to change the hearing date or to cancel, postpone, or continue the hearing, except for good cause as determined by the board. After completion of the hearing the board shall close the hearing record. If a settlement agreement is reached by the parties less than 14 days before the hearing, the parties shall appear at the time of the scheduled hearing to state the terms of the settlement agreement. Within 30 days after the hearing record closes, the board shall file its decision.

       The legislature made a rational policy decision when it enacted the 1988 amendments to subsection (c) adopting an objective standard to determine whether mental injuries are compensable. While both physical and mental injuries are real phenomena and very important to those who suffer from them, the two maladies are inherently different in ways that justify different treatment. In an attempt to ensure the quick, efficient, fair, and predictable delivery of medical benefits to injured workers, and to prevent fraud and abuse, thereby reducing costs to employers, the legislature, by enacting the 1988 amendment, removed the presumption of compensability for mental injuries and enacted the extraordinary and unusual test.

      <p>
       The presumption of compensability is not so limited that it does not apply in cases where the injury is not shown to have occurred on the job and is not sudden or unexplained, but rather the result of a preexisting condition which may have been aggravated by the employment. Burgess Constr. Co. v. Smallwood, 623 P.2d 312 (Alaska 1981).

       Where claimant’s theory was that his employment conditions, particularly his work on a haul road, aggravated his preexisting renal dysfunction by preventing him from getting proper medical attention and maintaining a low salt diet necessary to control hypertension, which accelerated his ultimate renal failure, such aggravation or acceleration must be presumed in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary.

      <p>
       Presumption of compensability did not apply to claimant’s case because the employer and the insurer did not dispute claimant’s entitlement to reemployment benefits or their liability for those benefits.

       The question in a particular case of whether the employment did so contribute to aggravate or accelerate the final result is one of fact which is usually determined from medical testimony, but once a prima facie case of work-relatedness is made, the board may not ignore the presumption and allocate the burden of proof to the claimant.

       Because the Board never inquired whether the employer had overcome its burden of rebutting the presumption of compensability with regard to the existence of a work-related injury, it incorrectly treated the claimant as having the burden to prove both the existence of a permanent disability and the work-relatedness of his injuries.

       The Workers’ Compensation Board’s failure to explicitly state that claimant was entitled to the presumption of compensability was a harmless error where the board articulated the correct legal standard and then concluded that claimant should be compensated because her work aggravated her preexisting injury and was a substantial factor in bringing about her current disability, so that no doubt could exist that the board applied the proper legal analysis.

       Two possible ways of overcoming the presumption of compensability are (1) by affirmative evidence showing that the death was not work-connected, or (2) by eliminating all reasonable possibilities that the death was work-connected. Miller v. ITT Arctic Servs., 577 P.2d 1044 (Alaska 1978); Burgess Constr. Co. v. Smallwood, 623 P.2d 312 (Alaska 1981).

       The employer can overcome the presumption of compensability by introducing affirmative evidence that the assault was not work-related. Marsh v. Alaska Workmen's Comp. Bd., 584 P.2d 1134 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the statutory presumption of workers’ compensation coverage governs, it is necessary for the employer to show by substantial evidence that the employee’s continuing back problems did not result from the work-related accident. Rogers Elec. Co. v. Kouba, 603 P.2d 909 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the presumption of compensability has been raised, it is the employer’s burden to come forward with substantial evidence that the injury was not work related in order to overcome the presumption. The employer may overcome the presumption in two ways: (1) present affirmative evidence that the injury was not work related, or (2) eliminate all reasonable possibilities that the injury was work-connected. Resler v. Universal Servs., 778 P.2d 1146 (Alaska 1989).
      </p>

       There are two ways by which the presumption of compensability can be overcome in relation to work-relatedness: affirmative evidence that the injury was not work-related, or elimination of all reasonable possibilities that the injury was work-connected. Adamson v. University of Alaska, 819 P.2d 886 (Alaska 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       To rebut the presumption of compensability set out in subsection (a), it is not required that medical experts not only rule out a link between employment and disability but also present an alternative diagnosis. An employer has always been able to rebut the presumption of compensability with an expert opinion that the claimant’s work was probably not a substantial cause of the disability. Childs v. Copper Valley Elec. Ass'n, 860 P.2d 1184 (Alaska 1993).

       There is no inconsistency between the presumption of compensability found in this section and a holding that the burden of proving that an injury arose out of and in the course of the employment rests upon the claimant for compensation, for the presumption of this section places a burden on the employer to go forward with evidence on the issue of whether the injury arises outside or within the scope of employment.

       In workers’ compensation cases, compensability is presumed once the worker establishes a “preliminary link” between his employment and his disability. The employer can rebut this presumption by producing substantial evidence that the injury is not compensable.

       The presumption of compensability shifts the burden of production to the employer once the employee has established a preliminary link between his employment and the injury. Since the presumption shifts only the burden of production and not the burden of persuasion, the evidence tending to rebut the presumption should be examined by itself and not weighed by the court with the evidence tending to establish causation in deciding whether the employer has produced substantial evidence to rebut the presumption.

       There was substantial evidence rebutting the presumption of compensability including: (1) evidence that employee’s illness was the result of an allergic reaction to another substance; (2) doctor’s opinion that employee may have mistaken her one allergy for another allergy; (3) employee’s delays in seeking medical attention for “life-threatening” reactions; (4) the opinion of an allergy specialist who was “not convinced” that employee’s illnesses were caused by the contested substance; (5) a determination that employer’s doctor was more qualified than employee’s doctor; (6) a determination that employer’s doctor’s procedure was more accurate and accepted; (7) medical opinion that if employee were allergic to often-used contested substance, it was unlikely that she would have suffered only four reactions in 10 years of employment; and (8) the fact that the board was presented with significantly more medical testimony on employer’s behalf.

       Credibility of witnesses.

     <p>
      The board has the sole power to determine the credibility of a witness.
      A finding by the board concerning the weight to be accorded a witness’s testimony, including medical testimony and reports, is conclusive even if the evidence is conflicting or susceptible to contrary conclusions.
      The findings of the board are subject to the same standard of review as a jury’s finding in a civil action.

       Deference should be given to the Alaska Workers’ Compensation Board’s determination of witness credibility. However, the weight to be accorded the doctors’ testimony must take place after a determination of whether the presumption of compensability has been overcome. Norcon, Inc. v. Alaska Workers' Compensation Bd., 880 P.2d 1051 (Alaska 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Injured employee improperly tried to apply the rule that doubtful medical evidence should be resolved in her favor beyond its original scope; the record included testimony and reports of multiple medical experts who unequivocally expressed the opinion that the employee’s condition likely was not caused by her injury. Brown v. Patriot Maint., Inc., 99 P.3d 544 (Alaska 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska Workers’ Compensation Board was free to give less weight to the treating physician’s testimony as he was not an expert in toxicology, and substantial evidence supported the board’s finding that the employee did not establish a compensable claim. Apone v. Fred Meyer, Inc., 226 P.3d 1021 (Alaska 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the Workers’ Compensation Board’s decision rejecting the employee’s claim because two orthopedic doctors testified that the employee’s lower back pain was probably not caused by the initial accident or by subsequent surgery, rebutting the presumption of compensability; the board did not err by giving little weight to a doctor who thought that the employee’s back pain was related to his work accident because the doctor largely deferred to one of the orthopedic doctors.
       Davis v. Kiewit Constr. Co., — P.3d — (Alaska Oct. 6, 2010) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska Workers’ Compensation Appeals Commission properly upheld the denial of an employee’s claim for benefits by the Alaska Workers’ Compensation Board. Because the board was authorized to weigh the medical evidence, it was entitled to give less weight to the testimony of the employee’s family physician. Rivera v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 247 P.3d 957 (Alaska 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers’ Compensation Board was empowered to weigh the evidence from medical records showing employee had symptoms in her wrist for many years, and to determine that a doctor’s testimony indicating the employee had a permanent condition was credible evidence.
       Rockstad v. Chugach Eareckson Support Servs., — P.3d — (Alaska Jan. 18, 2012) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Award of workers’ compensation benefits to an employee who injured her back should not have been overturned by the Alaska Workers’ Compensation Appeals Commission. The Commission is required to accept the Alaska Workers’ Compensation Board’s credibility determinations, including its decision regarding witness credibility. De Rosario v. Lodging, 297 P.3d 139 (Alaska 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee could not avoid a settlement of his workers’ compensation claim on grounds of duress, when the employer demanded the return of funds paid pursuant to the settlement if the employee were not going to perform the settlement. The Alaska Workers’ Compensation Board found the employee’s claim of coercion was not credible, and those findings were binding, so the employee could not show that he involuntarily accepted the settlement. Rosales v. Icicle Seafoods, Inc., 316 P.3d 580 (Alaska 2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1004, 134 S. Ct. 1516, 188 L. Ed. 2d 452 (U.S. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Worker's injury was properly found not compensable, under a pre-2005 presumption analysis, because the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board permissibly found substantial credible evidence showed an employer rebutted a presumption of compensability, as medical reports excluded work-related factors as a substantial cause of a disability and need for treatment, as physicians found no pathology supporting claims of pain, and two psychiatrists did not think the worker was disabled or needed treatment due to a work-related incident.
       McCullough v. Job Ready, Inc., — P.3d — (Alaska Dec. 21, 2016) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the decision of the Workers' Compensation Board that a worker was entitled to compensation because medical testimony that the worker would not have become disabled but for the work exacerbating a prior injury showed the work was the most important cause of the disability. Traugott v. Arctec Alaska, 465 P.3d 499 (Alaska 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming that a worker did need further medical care for the worker's lower back, substantial evidence supported the the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board's decision that the worker's employment was not the substantial cause of that need because doctors diagnosed degenerative disc disease unrelated to the worker's lower back injury at work. Espindola v. Peter Pan Seafoods, Inc., 486 P.3d 1116 (Alaska 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board's crucial findings supporting its decision with regard to a worker's shoulder injury were not supported by the record as the testimony and reports from the worker's treating doctors did not diagnose the worker's shoulder condition with certainty, the Alaska Workers' Compensation Commission erred in concluding that the findings were supported by substantial evidence. Espindola v. Peter Pan Seafoods, Inc., 486 P.3d 1116 (Alaska 2021).

       Because health questionnaires were the only written records that employer alleged that it had before employee’s injury, question whether employer’s knowledge of a permanent impairment satisfied the written record requirement turned on what conclusions could have been drawn from those health questionnaires; because the board was charged with evaluating evidence in compensation proceedings, the case needed to be remanded to the board.

       Although deference should be given to the board’s determination of a witness’ credibility, any weighing of medical testimony may not take place at the rebuttal stage. Rather, determining the weight to be accorded the doctors’ testimony must take place after a determination of whether the presumption has been overcome. Norcon, Inc. v. Alaska Workers' Compensation Bd., 880 P.2d 1051 (Alaska 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a worker alleged he injured his hip, lower back and ear during a fight with his co-workers, the Workers’ Compensation Board erred by applying the presumption of compensability in considering the worker’s credibility at the first stage of the analysis under this section; however, the error was harmless because the Board correctly determined the employer rebutted the presumption with evidence showing the pain the worker reported more than a year later was not caused by the fight. McGahuey v. Whitestone Logging, Inc., 262 P.3d 613 (Alaska 2011).

        While the supreme court will not vacate findings of the Workmen’s Compensation Board if supported by substantial evidence, its scope of review is not so limited where the board’s decision rests on erroneous legal foundations. Hewing v. Alaska Workmen's Compensation Bd., 512 P.2d 896 (Alaska 1973); Alaska State Hous. Auth. v. Sullivan, 518 P.2d 759 (Alaska 1974); M-K Rivers v. Schleifman, 599 P.2d 132 (Alaska 1979).

        The reviewing court is not to weigh the evidence or choose between competing inferences reasonably to be drawn from the evidence.

       <p>
        In order to modify a previous order on the theory of mistake, a new order should make it clear that it is doing so, should review the evidence of the first hearing and should indicate in what respect the first order was mistaken, whether in the inaccuracy of the evidence, in the impropriety of the inferences drawn from it, or because of the impossibility of detecting the existence of the particular condition at the time of the earlier order.

       </p>
       <p>
        In order to justify the modification of a compensation order on the basis of a mistake, the subsequent showing must consist of something more than additional evidence of facts already known, an accumulation of testimony on facts previously established, a mere change of mind by a witness, or a reanalysis of the prior record by the deputy and a change of his conclusions as a result of a retrospective exploration of the original record.

       Nothing in the regulation of the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board or the statute ties an attorney's hourly rate solely to his or her experience in Alaska workers' compensation law; the Board must consider all of the factors set out in Alaska R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(a) when determining a reasonable attorney's fee, and those factors must guide the Board's analysis of the reasonableness of requested fees. Rusch v.

      <p>
       Because reemployment eligibility was tied to an employee's inability to return to employment at the time of injury, a claimant's termination and the reasons for it were not wholly unrelated to her reemployment claim; thus, the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board erred in its attorney's fees award.

      <p>
       Because of the uncertainty in both the duration and amount of an employee's continuing permanent total disability benefits, the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board's award of fees accomplished the statutory objectives; in light of the uncertain amount of continuing benefits and uncertain length of the human lifespan, the Board could reasonably fashion a fee award as it did, awarding fees both as a lump sum based on the past work of the employee's attorney and as statutory minimum fees. Dep't of Corr. v. Wozniak, 491 P.3d 1081 (Alaska 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska Workers' Compensation Appeals Commission correctly determined that the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board did not abuse its discretion in awarding fees above statutory minimum fees because the award was not manifestly unreasonable, and the order was consistent with the statute; based on the affidavit of the employee's attorney documenting the time he spent on the permanent total disability claim, Board regulations allowed the Board to award fees in excess of the statute's minimum fees.

      <p>
       Workers' compensation attorney's fees awards are in some ways analogous to other fee-shifting statutory schemes; thus, in a workers' compensation settlement where the parties dispute the issues on which a claimant prevailed for purposes of attorney's fees, the employer who contends its conduct was a wholly gratuitous response to a claim that lacked colorable merit, must demonstrate the worthlessness of the claim and explain why it nonetheless voluntarily gave the claimant the requested relief.

      <p>
       Alaska Workers' Compensation erred in affirming the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board's analysis about the issues on which the claimants prevailed because the Board did not offer a rationale for its decisions about success, nor did it explore how the non-monetary issues could have impacted one of the claimant's success on her monetary claims; the Board should consider the discovery issues that it did not have to resolve because of the settlement.

       Fees awarded were unreasonably low because due to the procedure the Alaska Board of Workers' Compensation used, the claimants were not able to document and get payment for their attorney's time spent responding to the employer's extensive objections to the fee affidavits or its objection to the timeliness of their responses.

      <p>
       Reduction in hours solely based on the use of quarter-hour increments was an abuse of discretion because the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board's regulations did not require use of a specific time increment, and the Board did not tell an attorney at the hearing that he needed to use tenths of an hour so that he could modify his affidavit.

       Reductions solely based on block billing were an abuse of discretion because the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board's regulation did not prohibit block billing, and prior Board decisions did not have a clear rule about reductions solely for block billing; in evaluating entries with block billing, the Board at times awarded less time than the employer agreed was reasonable without explaining why.

       Alaska Board of Workers' Compensation's use of extra-record information without providing the claimants an opportunity to see and respond to it before the Board made its decision violated due process because the Board has no regulation tying a certain number of clients or years of practice to a specific hourly fee; the Board had no regulation explaining how experience in workers' compensation was measured and how that experience was used to arrive at a reasonable hourly fee.

       Alaska Workers' Compensation Act is to be construed and applied in a manner that encourages, not discourages, attorney representation of injured workers; awarding only a paralegal rate for work done by an attorney will result in fewer attorneys who will represent claimants; reducing an attorney's hourly fee to a paralegal rate for work the attorney performed discourages rather than encourages representation of injured workers.

      <p>
       Alaska Workers' Compensation Board and Commission should not penalize an attorney who does not employ a paralegal and performs legal tasks that either an attorney or a paralegal can perform; even when attorneys employ paralegals, attorneys must have discretion to manage their law practices and select which tasks to delegate to paralegals.

      </p>
      <p>
       Attorney's voluntary decision to charge only a paralegal rate in one claim does not create a legal rule that permits the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board to reduce arbitrarily the fees awarded when an attorney performs tasks that are necessary to the claim but might be within a paralegal's duties in a larger firm.

       It was improper to award a paralegal's hourly rate for legal tasks performed by an attorney because the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board's regulations allowed awards of attorney's fees only to licensed attorneys and permitted paralegal work to be billed as a cost only when the paralegal was employed by an attorney licensed in this state or another state.

       This section does not directly state whether attorney’s fees should be paid periodically or in a lump sum. However, fees based on a percentage of an award cannot be presently calculated for lump sum payment where substantial uncertainties exist as to the value of the award, since the claimant will receive permanent total disability benefits only as long as he lives and continues to be unable to work because of his disability, or since the claimant’s future benefits may also be reduced or eliminated if the claimant recovers damages or a settlement from a third-party tortfeasor.

       The amount of the court’s award of attorney’s fees to the claimant’s counsel was not an abuse of discretion in light of the time spent by counsel, the complexity and novelty of the case, the benefit which resulted to the claimant, and the contingent nature of counsel’s right to compensation.

      <p>
       An attorney in a workers’ compensation proceeding has the right to appeal from an award of attorney’s fees by either the board or the superior court. Rose v. Alaskan Village, 412 P.2d 503 (Alaska 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Commission erred in denying attorney fees to the claimant on appeal, as he raised enough questions about the Board’s award of fees to have that award vacated. Humphrey v. Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse, Inc., 337 P.3d 1174 (Alaska 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the State did not ask the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board or the Alaska Workers' Compensation Appeals Commission to construe the statute to require an analysis of future statutory minimum fees to compare them to reasonable fees, because its appellate argument depended on new facts, and because the argument was neither closely related to its arguments made before the administrative agencies nor inferable from those arguments, the State waived consideration of the argument.

        The original check was mailed to employee within the statutory 14 days, but when the check was never received, stopping payment on the initial check reinstated the payment obligation, and imposed a new 14-day deadline. But because employer did not mail the substitute payment to the employee until 19 days after it stopped payment, the court found that it failed to comply with the statute’s 14-day mandate under subsection (f) of this section, and the court had no discretion to excuse the mandatory 25 percent penalty for late payment.

        To the extent that claimant’s procedural due process claims were based on the assertion that the board should have scheduled a hearing sua sponte under this section, the argument was meritless.

        Because the State's controversion, based on the employer's medical evaluation (EME) report, contended that the care was not related to the work injury, the Workers' Compensation Board was required to evaluate the EME report in order to determine whether the care was compensable and the State was liable for the controverted services.

       </p>
       <p>
        When an employee was evaluated for both orthopedic and psychiatric injuries, an employer had to pay permanent partial impairment (PPI) compensation after each rating because (1) PPI and temporary total disability (TTD) compensated for different losses, (2) PPI was not tied to medical stability, and (3) the employer did not controvert an orthopedic rating, despite the employee's continued receipt of psychiatric TTD benefits.

        Employer's controversions, one related to the claimant's medical treatment and the other one related to the claimant's temporary total disability and medical benefits, were frivolous under the Alaska Workers' Compensation Appeals Commission's precedent because the employer did not have sufficient evidence to support its factual assertions in the controversions.

       <p>
        For a controversion notice to be filed in good faith, the employer must possess sufficient evidence in support of the controversion that, if the claimant does not introduce evidence in opposition to the controversion, the board would find that the claimant is not entitled to benefits. Harp v. ARCO Alaska, 831 P.2d 352 (Alaska 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Alaska Workers’ Compensation Board’s conclusions that the employer’s controversions were not frivolous or unfair were supported by the evidence where employer filed the controversions on the bases that: (1) The injury in question was not work-related, (2) the claimant refused to attend a required medical examination, (3) the claimant had been released to return to work, or (4) the claimant refused to sign releases as ordered to by the board.

        Alaska Workers’ Compensation Board properly denied claimants’ request for a penalty against an employer, which failed to pay death benefits even after a second jury found that an employee died, because there was no finding that the employer acted in bad faith in filing its controversion.

        Workers’ Compensation Appeals Commission erred in deciding that no penalty could be imposed upon an employer for the bad faith controversion of a prescription for a bed because its construction of the Workers’ Compensation Act was contrary to the Act’s purpose of providing quick, efficient, fair, and predictable delivery of medical benefits to a claimant; the Act permits imposition of a penalty where a medical benefit has been prescribed but not yet paid.

        A showing of “financial irresponsibility” alone is insufficient to obtain a stay of a workers’ compensation award. The movant must also show that these are serious and substantial questions going to the merits of the case (rather than the former standard of probable success on the merits of the appeal).

       For workers’ compensation purposes total disability does not necessarily mean a state of abject helplessness.
       It means the inability because of injuries to perform services other than those which are so limited in quality, dependability or quantity that a reasonably stable market for them does not exist. J. B. Warrack Co. v. Roan, 418 P.2d 986 (Alaska 1966).

      </p>
      <p>
       Disability ratings, as distinct from ratings based on the concept of permanent impairment, are based on the worker’s loss of earning capacity and are not measured by any particular degree of medical impairment. Rydwell v. Anchorage Sch. Dist., 864 P.2d 526 (Alaska 1993).

      </p>
      <p>
       If, by reason of certain injuries, a worker is, under this section, totally and permanently disabled from doing any work, it follows that there is no remaining ability to work which can be affected, either permanently or temporarily, by other injuries received in the same accident. Alaska Indus. Bd. v. Chugach Elec. Ass'n, 245 F.2d 855, 17 Alaska 183 (9th Cir. Alaska 1957), rev'd, 356 U.S. 320, 78 S. Ct. 735, 2 L. Ed. 2d 795 (U.S. 1958).

        Applicability of suitable regular employment standard. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In making a permanent total disability determination, evidence that suitable regular employment is continuously available elsewhere in the United States generally does not prove regular and continuously available employment in the labor markets specified by subsection (a) of this section, absent evidence that the pertinent labor markets are similar to the national market. Leigh v. Seekins Ford, 136 P.3d 214 (Alaska 2006).

       <b>
        Sufficiency of labor market evidence. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a rehabilitation counselor did not expressly testify that regular and continuously available employment existed in the specific labor markets listed in subsection (a) of this section, labor market evidence ws inadequate, and, on remand, the employer had to present specific evidence of regular and continuously available employment in the relevant labor markets listed in the statute. Leigh v. Seekins Ford, 136 P.3d 214 (Alaska 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       In making a permanent total disability determination, the fortuity of a specific position’s availability at any given time does not determine that a regular market for the job exists. Instead, the proper focus must remain on whether an employer has presented substantial evidence that there are jobs reasonably available in the relevant labor market that an employee could realistically obtain and hold. Leigh v. Seekins Ford, 136 P.3d 214 (Alaska 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       In making a permanent total disability determination that a regular market for a job existed, rehabilitation counsel’s testimony that openings occurred for the jobs that she identified as suitable for the claimant was insufficient, where she did not testify that the claimant had a realistic chance of obtaining and holding one of those jobs.

       Because a worker presented no evidence that an ear infection was disabling other than his own testimony that it caused him pain, the Alaska Workers' Compensation Appeals Commission correctly determined that substantial evidence supported the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board's finding that the worker was not entitled to ongoing TTD. Moreover, nothing in the record indicated that he did not or could not perform his job when he had a documented hearing loss, and no healthcare provider had suggested that his hearing loss was disabling.

       The period of temporary total disability is defined as: the healing period or the time during which the worker is wholly disabled and unable by reason of his injury to work. It is, therefore, a separate and unitary period of compensation, and as such is distinguished from a permanent partial disability. Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Alaska Indus. Bd., 17 Alaska 658 (D.

      <p>
       In calculating a lump sum award for a permanent partial disability, the employee’s total future loss equals the total payments the employee would receive for his normal life expectancy, without considering actual or possible retirement. Bailey v. Litwin Corp., 780 P.2d 1007 (Alaska 1989).

      <p>
       The determination of lost earning capacity is not limited to an examination of those losses that appear immediately after claimant’s injury stabilizes, but it requires the board to use all “available clues” to forecast the losses that the disabled claimant will incur over the course of her work life. Fairbanks N. Star Borough Sch. Dist. v. Crider, 736 P.2d 770 (Alaska 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       To fairly measure the difference between pre- and post-injury earning capacity, the board must first eliminate substantial differences caused by inflation.
       Where there is a substantial difference in wage levels, the post-injury earnings should be corrected to correspond with the general wage level in force at the time that pre-injury earnings were calculated, or the pre-injury earnings should be recomputed at the scale in effect at the time of the post-injury earnings.

      <p>
       In permanent partial disability situations, the ultimate finding of decrease in earning capacity must be based upon basic fact findings which relate to inability to earn wages, as evidenced by proof of a disparity between wages earned before and after the injury was sustained, and to the claimant’s physical condition.

        Under the whole man theory, the primary criteria governing disability awards are physiological and psychiatric. This theory challenges the concept, basic to Alaska’s Workmen’s Compensation Law, that unscheduled partial disability awards should be made for economic loss, not for physical injury as such.

       <p>
        It appears to be the duty of the board to determine the amount of wages or compensation the injured employee is capable of earning and which he is or may be precluded from earning and receiving by reason of his injuries, and base the award on that result. Vanney v. Alaska Packers Ass'n, 12 Alaska 284 (D. Alaska 1949). See Hohn v. Alaska Indus. Bd., 150 F. Supp. 519, 17 Alaska 94 (D. Alaska 1957).

        An award must be supported by an ultimate finding that the claimant has suffered a compensable disability, or more precisely, a decrease in his earning capacity. Manthey v. Collier, 367 P.2d 884 (Alaska 1962); Vetter v. Alaska Workmen's Compensation Bd., 524 P.2d 264 (Alaska 1974); Hewing v. Peter Kiewit &amp; Sons, 586 P.2d 182 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The ultimate finding that the claimant has suffered a compensable disability must be based upon basic fact findings which relate to inability to earn wages as evidenced by proof of a disparity between wages earned before and after the injury was sustained, and to the claimant’s physical condition. Manthey v. Collier, 367 P.2d 884 (Alaska 1962); Hewing v. Alaska Workmen's Compensation Bd., 512 P.2d 896 (Alaska 1973).

        The fact that one who is physically disabled from manual labor and is unqualified in other types of work is not motivated to seek work, is not the equivalent of a physically competent person being unemployed due to lack of motivation.

        Just as no one should be denied a fair award because, by reason of his injury, he may be unable to prove that he would inevitably have had remunerative employment during the period of his actual disability, so also, one temporarily or seasonally employed at wages above the scale which he was earning or is capable of earning during the remainder of the year may not justly claim disability compensation based on those seasonal or temporary wages for a disability arising during such employment which does not really disable the employee until after the temporary or seasonal employment has been carried through to completion without any loss of wages therefor.

       Liability may be imposed on a subsequent employer only after the claimant has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the employment aggravated, accelerated, or combined with a preexisting condition and that this aggravation, acceleration or combination was a substantial factor contributing to the ultimate disability.

       that the injury would not have happened “but for” an act, omission or force and that reasonable persons would regard this act, omission or force as a cause and attach responsibility to it. Fairbanks N. Star Borough v. Rogers &amp; Babler, 747 P.2d 528 (Alaska 1987).

       This course has the advantage of avoiding subtle inquiries into the degree by which a particular pre-existing impairment affected the employability of a given workman.

        Constitutionality. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The gross weekly wage determination method of this section as it existed prior to the 1995 amendment created large differences in compensation between similarly situated injured workers, bore no relationship to the goal of accurately calculating an injured employee’s lost wages for purposes of determining his or her compensation, was unfair to workers whose past history did not accurately reflect their future earning capacity, and was unnecessary to achieve quickness, efficiency, or predictability. The formula expressed was not substantially related to the purposes of the Workers’ Compensation Act and could not survive scrutiny on even the lowest end of the sliding scale; therefore, the formula was an unconstitutional infringement on the equal protection clause of the Alaska Constitution. Gilmore v. Alaska Workers' Comp. Bd., 882 P.2d 922 (Alaska 1994), amended, 882 P.2d 922 (Alaska 1994), limited, Dougan v. Aurora Elec., Inc., 50 P.3d 789 (Alaska 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to determine whether subsection (a), prior to the 1995 amendment, could be constitutionally applied to a particular employee, the first question was whether a worker’s past employment history was an accurate predictor of losses due to injury. As a general matter, if past wage levels had no rational tendency to show earning capacity, application of the paragraph (a)(1) formula might be unfair to either employer or employee, but, where past wage levels were accurate predictors, the Board was required to apply the statutory formula. Thompson v. UPS, 975 P.2d 684 (Alaska 1999).

        Retroactivity of amendment. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       As the 1995 amendments to this section evidence no intent that the provision be applied retrospectively, the 1988 version of subsection (a), defining spendable weekly wages, is applicable to cases where the injury occurred prior to September 4, 1995. Thompson v. UPS, 975 P.2d 684 (Alaska 1999).

       It is common knowledge that many employees come to Alaska, either being recruited by contractors to work on a certain job or on their own volition to find employment at the high wages of the construction industry in Alaska, and, upon the termination of their particular job or the completion of the project, return to their home states.
       When those circumstances exist and the claimant, after his return, is found to be entitled to workers’ compensation based upon injury received, the rate should be based upon the amount of pay he would have received at the same type of employment in the state of his residence.

       Where an employee worked part-time while receiving workers’ compensation benefits for a shoulder injury, the nondisclosure of his work was not a “false statement or representation”; the Workers’ Compensation Board erred by ordering the employee to reimburse his employer for workers’ compensation benefits he received for the entire time he was working and by ordering him to pay the employer’s attorney fees. Common law fraud elements were not applicable, an affirmative false statement or representation must be a causal factor in the employer’s payment of workers’ compensation benefits to constitute fraud, and the appeal was not frivolous.

        Several of the cases cited in the notes below were decided under prior statutes.

         Constitutionality. —

       </p>
       <p>
        This section’s definition of “medical stability,” its burden of proof, and its presumption of medical stability are constitutional and do not violate substantive due process. Municipality of Anchorage v. Leigh, 823 P.2d 1241 (Alaska 1992).

       <p>
        <b>
         Underlying premise of workmen’s compensation system

        is that liability is based upon the existence of an employment relationship, not upon a determination of culpability. M-K Rivers v. Schleifman, 599 P.2d 132 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Liberal construction. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Normally the Alaska Workmen’s Compensation Act is read liberally to effectuate its beneficent purposes. S.L.W. v. Alaska Workmen's Compensation Bd., 490 P.2d 42 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Broad coverage. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a general policy of applying the coverage provisions of workers’ compensation acts broadly. S.L.W. v. Alaska Workmen's Compensation Bd., 490 P.2d 42 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the duties of decedent’s position were broadly defined and included “anything that would inure to the benefit of the country,” it would be difficult to find a rational basis upon which it could be asserted that he was not acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the crash. Laborers &amp; Hod Carriers Union v. Groothuis, 494 P.2d 808 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>

        <b>
         Controversion. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Employer's controversions, one related to the claimant's medical treatment and the other one related to the claimant's temporary total disability and medical benefits, were frivolous under the Alaska Workers' Compensation Appeals Commission's precedent because the employer did not have sufficient evidence to support its factual assertions in the controversions. Vue v. Walmart Assocs., 475 P.3d 270 (Alaska 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Paragraph (24) not vague. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        While the statute must necessarily address the subject broadly because every employee’s condition is different, it provides specific information on how to determine whether a stress related mental injury is in fact compensable under the Act. It thus has meaning in itself and through the process of adjudication this meaning will be enhanced. Paragraph (17) (now (24)) is not void for vagueness as amended in 1988 and the claimant was not deprived of procedural due process. Williams v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 895 P.2d 99 (Alaska 1995).

        The compensation remedy should not be exclusive when an employee commits an intentional tort on a fellow worker. Elliott v. Brown, 569 P.2d 1323 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Workmen’s compensation benefits are paid from employees’ premiums, as a means of spreading the cost of hazards of the workplace.
        It would not be wise public policy to allow an intentional tort-feasor to shift his liability for his acts to such a fund. Assaults by fellow workers differ not in degree, but in kind, from the type of harm the statute was enacted to deal with. Elliott v. Brown, 569 P.2d 1323 (Alaska 1977).

       <p>
        The beneficial effect of the rule that workmen’s compensation is the exclusive remedy in workplace fight cases would be largely destroyed if every case required an inquiry into the relative rank of the assailant and victim, an inquiry which is not relevant to the question whether the quarrel was work-related. Elliott v. Brown, 569 P.2d 1323 (Alaska 1977).

       <p>
        Where the manager of the corporate premises was guilty of assault and battery, directed against two employees, the corporate veil may not be pierced and the corporation’s assets made liable for his intentional torts merely because the manager controlled the activities of the corporation, owned 50 percent of its shares and was its president.
        Workmen’s compensation is the exclusive remedy against the employer. Elliott v. Brown, 569 P.2d 1323 (Alaska 1977).

        Former § 43-3-9, ACLA 1949, defining “independent contractor,” meant that one was to be regarded as an employee if the principal had the right to control the details of the work; and the four principal factors showing right of control were: (1) direct evidence of right or exercise of control; (2) method of payment; (3) furnishing of equipment; and (4) the right to fire.

        The trial court’s instruction embodying the master-servant control test for determination of “employee” status was harmless error because this test is narrower than the “nature of the work” criterion and therefore more favorable to a plaintiff suing for personal injury than an instruction using the relative nature of the work test.

         Dual employment. —

       </p>
       <p>
        The dual employment situation arises when an employee of two employers, who is under the separate control of each, performs services which are more closely related to the business of one than of the other.
        When dual employment is found, the employers will be liable for compensation either jointly or separately, depending upon whether it is possible to ascribe the service of the employee at the time of his injury or death to a particular employer or to several employers.
        The more difficult it is to determine whose interests the employee was furthering at the time of his injury, the greater is the likelihood of joint liability. Laborers &amp; Hod Carriers Union v. Groothuis, 494 P.2d 808 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        An employee can be said to be a joint employee when he simultaneously engages in work for more than one employer and the work performed for each employer is identical or nearly identical to that performed for the other employer.
        Both employers are clearly liable when there is joint employment. Laborers &amp; Hod Carriers Union v. Groothuis, 494 P.2d 808 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>

       <p>
        While some cases have used a hairsplitting approach to uphold the liability of one employer when a dual employment relationship exists, the better view is more flexible and provides for joint liability when there are only incidental services being performed for one of the employers while the employee is primarily on the business of the other employer.

        The difficulty of determining the place of infection or the cause of a nonindustrial disease, including a cold, is undoubtedly the reason that a causal connection must be shown under the workmen’s compensation acts between such disease and some unusual event or condition of employment as a prerequisite to recovery of compensation.

        Adoption of the “greater than all employees must experience” requirement with regard to mental injuries is contrary to the fundamental principle in workers’ compensation law that the Workers’ Compensation Act should be read liberally and that the employer must take the employee “as he finds him.” Fox v.

        A “greater than all employees must experience” test as a preliminary means of demonstrating mental injuries is neither essential nor even germane to the legislative requirement that the injury “arise out of” the employment; furthermore, the argument that threshold requirements are necessary for mental injuries because such injuries are easier to feign than physical injuries is unsubstantiated.

         Workers’ compensation law and respondeat superior doctrine differ in scope. —

       </p>
       <p>
        While workmen’s compensation law and respondeat superior doctrine both involve allocations of costs regarding industrial accidents, they differ in scope. Luth v. Rogers &amp; Babler Constr. Co., 507 P.2d 761 (Alaska 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the supreme court has noted the similarity between Alaska workmen’s compensation policy and the enterprise theory of vicarious tort liability, it has not equated the tort concept “in the scope of employment” with the workmen’s compensation concept “arising out of and in the course of employment.” Luth v. Rogers &amp; Babler Constr. Co., 507 P.2d 761 (Alaska 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Workmen’s compensation benefits turn solely upon whether the employee was injured while performing an activity related to his job — and “relatedness” is usually a function of benefit to the employer. Luth v. Rogers &amp; Babler Constr. Co., 507 P.2d 761 (Alaska 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        In contrast, respondeat superior subjects employers to liability for injuries suffered by an indefinite number of third persons.
        To limit this burden of liability, the narrower concept, “scope of employment,” has long been tied to the employer’s right to control the employee’s activity at the time of his tortious conduct.
        While the right to control is not a prerequisite to a holding of liability, it is a factor that may be considered in determining whether the employee’s activity is sufficiently related to his employer’s enterprise, and while the employer’s benefit from the employee’s activity is relevant to the existence of vicarious liability, benefit is not its sole determinant.

Uganik Fisheries v. Alaska Indus. Bd., 12 Alaska 242 (D. Alaska 1949); Anchorage Roofing Co. v. Gonzales, 507 P.2d 501 (Alaska 1973).

        There is an exception to the general rule as to injuries incurred going to and from work not arising in the course of employment, called the special errand doctrine, that is based on the principle that the particular journey is an inherent part of the employment. R. C. A. Serv. Co. v. Liggett, 394 P.2d 675 (Alaska 1964); Department of Highways v. Johns, 422 P.2d 855 (Alaska), aff'd, Johns v. State Dep't of Highways, 431 P.2d 148 (Alaska 1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        The special errand rule may be stated as follows: When an employee, having identifiable time and space limits on his employment, makes an off-premises journey which would normally not be covered under the usual going and coming rule, the journey may be brought within the course of employment by the fact that the trouble and time of making the journey, or the special inconvenience, hazard, or urgency of making it in the particular circumstances, is itself sufficiently substantial to be viewed as an integral part of the service itself. Department of Highways v. Johns, 422 P.2d 855 (Alaska), aff'd, Johns v. State Dep't of Highways, 431 P.2d 148 (Alaska 1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        The general rule pertaining to injuries sustained by employees when going to or returning from their regular place of work is subject to exceptions which depend upon the nature and circumstances of the particular employment.
        No exact formula can be laid down which will automatically solve every case. While service on regular hours at a stated place generally begins at that place, there is always room for agreement by which the service may be taken to begin earlier or elsewhere. Service in extra hours or on special errands has an element of distinction which the employer may recognize by agreeing that such service shall commence when the employee leaves his home on the duty assigned to him and shall continue until his return.
        An agreement to that effect may be either express or be shown by the course of business. In such case the hazards of the journey may properly be regarded as hazards of the service and hence within the purview of the Workmen’s Compensation Act. Department of Highways v. Johns, 422 P.2d 855 (Alaska), aff'd, Johns v. State Dep't of Highways, 431 P.2d 148 (Alaska 1967).

       <p>
        The decedent’s trip to join his family for Christmas dinner was purely one of his own choice and for his own private purpose and convenience, and his employer took no part in arranging or paying for the transportation and exercised no control over the private carrier chartered by the decedent, and there was no express or implied agreement that his service would cover the time he was away from the job; therefore, the special errand exception to the going and coming rule was not applicable.

        There is a special hazard exception to the going-and-coming rule in workers’ compensation cases, and the presumption of compensability applies to the factual determinations necessary to decide whether a claim falls within that exception. Sokolowski v. Best Western Golden Lion Hotel, 813 P.2d 286 (Alaska 1991).

       <p>
        When an employer, in connection with the operation of its business, is charged with a legal duty to control or abate a specific hazard in the area adjacent to its premises, even a common hazard to which the general public is exposed, the legal duty itself supplies the necessary element of work-relatedness for a workers’ compensation action. Seville v. Holland Am. Line Westours, Inc., 977 P.2d 103 (Alaska 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even where the plaintiff was traveling to her future place of employment for a work-related purpose, her claim for compensation failed where the decision to visit that site, although acquiesced in by the future employer, was that of the plaintiff, and where flying to that remote location was not a special hazard causally related to employment, in that the normal route to work, once employment commenced and the plaintiff was living at the location, would not involve flying.

       <p>
        Although a demonstration that travel time was specifically paid for is one of the most reliable ways of making a case for the compensability of a going or coming trip, and is ordinarily sufficient in itself to support such a finding, the fact that the employee is not paid for his travel time does not mean that the trip was not in the course of employment.

        That a servant gave his wages to his parents, and such wages were devoted to the support of the family, is sufficient to afford a legal basis for the finding of actual dependency, within the Workmen’s Compensation Act. Ketchikan Lumber &amp; Shingle Co. v. Bishop, 24 F.2d 63, 5 Alaska Fed. 405 (9th Cir. Alaska 1928).

        It is clear under the statutory definition of “married” that a decedent, though divorced, is “married” for the purpose of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, where the divorce decree required him to contribute to the support of his former wife.

        Where one sustains an injury in Alaska, and then removes to another state, the amount of the award of compensation is determined by the wage rate of the state to which the claimant has removed. Hanson v. Benson, 179 F. Supp. 130 (D. Alaska 1959).

     <p>
      A fisherman, upon becoming disabled, is entitled to receive benefits as follows: immediately after the fisherman sustains an injury or disability arising out of an accident directly connected with operations as a fisherman, either ashore in the state or in Alaska water, or suffers an occupational disease, the fisherman is entitled to emergency treatment, transportation to the nearest place where approved medical facilities are available, medical care, and hospitalization. In this section, “Alaska water” means the inland and territorial water of the state and the fishery conservation zone adjacent to the state established by 16 U.S.C. 1811 (§ 101, Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976).

      The Department of Labor may not adopt a regulation requiring that a reasonable deductible amount be satisfied on each claim before the Fund pays benefits. March 4, 1985, Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is not required that an injury or accident be “directly caused” by the fishing endeavor; if the legislature had intended that interpretation, it seems likely that it would have said “directly caused by” rather than “directly connected with.” March 4, 1985, Op. Att’y Gen.

      The cost of treatment by acupuncture is an expense that is covered by the Fishermen’s Fund. June 18, 1985, Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The council is limited by the plain meaning of this section, which incorporates the federal definition by reference, to define Alaska waters as including to the 200 mile limit. March 30, 1988, Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The council can validly refuse to pay claims from Metlakatla fishermen who do not pay into the fund through the purchase of commercial license or gear holder permits even though he or she may be validly fishing in Metlakatla waters by tribal permit at the time of the injury. March 30, 1988, Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The fund is required to cover injuries that occur in the waters off Metlakatla, where fisheries are regulated by the tribal government of the Metlakatla Indian Community and not by the State of Alaska. March 30, 1988, Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fishermen who are injured while they are performing “test fishing” are not entitled to benefits from the Fishermen’s Fund because they were not commercial fishing when they were injured. February 17, 1999 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the Indian Health Service, an Indian tribe, or a tribal organization treats an Alaska Native for injuries occurring as a result of commercial fishing, the Fishermen’s Fund is not responsible for paying the cost for medical treatment. Section 25 U.S.C.A. 1621e(b) does not give the Indian Health Service, an Indian tribe, or a tribal organization a right of recovery for health care against the Fishermen’s Fund because the Commercial Fishermen’s Fund Act is neither a state workers’ compensation law nor a state self-insured program. August 16, 2001 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a private or public health provider under contract with the Indian Health Service treats the same fisherman, the Indian Health Service is the payor of last resort and consequently the Fishermen’s Fund is responsible for the first $2,500 that the private or public health provider charges for medical treatment.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature finds that joint decision-making is the modern way of administering government.
      If public employees have been granted the right to share in the decision-making process affecting wages and working conditions, they have become more responsive and better able to exchange ideas and information on operations with their administrators.
      Accordingly, government is made more effective. The legislature further finds that the enactment of positive legislation establishing guidelines for public employment relations is the best way to harness and direct the energies of public employees eager to have a voice in determining their conditions of work, to provide a rational method for dealing with disputes and work stoppages, to strengthen the merit principle where civil service is in effect, and to maintain a favorable political and social environment.
      The legislature declares that it is the public policy of the state to promote harmonious and cooperative relations between government and its employees and to protect the public by assuring effective and orderly operations of government.
      These policies are to be effectuated by

The Act also provides various mechanisms for resolution of employer and union or employee disputes. Thus, union representation and activity is not outside service and does not have to be reported.

       Superior court erred in affirming a ruling by the Alaska Labor Relations Agency (ALRA) that a city violated the Public Employer Relations Act in reconsidering and rejecting an agreement because the city council was not a public employer and because the ALRA panel's bad faith finding was not supported by substantial evidence where it was only after public comment and additional information from staff that the city council realized the city might not be able to afford the agreement, postponing the ratification vote gave the city council time to reassess the contract, and the city council's reevaluation and subsequent rejection of the agreement was a reflection of the political process.

       The union did not establish the presence of an antiunion motive on the part of the university where there was testimony that the applicant was not hired because more qualified applicants were available and ultimately because a lack of student interest caused the class to be cancelled and where although the union presented correspondence which demonstrated that the university considered the applicant’s unavailability (because of his position as a negotiator) in determining his qualification, there was unequivocal testimony that it was the mere fact of the applicant’s unavailability, not the reason therefor, which was considered in this regard.

     <p>
      If, after a reasonable period of negotiation over the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, a deadlock exists between a public employer and an organization, the labor relations agency may appoint a competent, impartial, disinterested person to act as mediator in any dispute either on its own initiative or on the request of one of the parties to the dispute.
      The parties may also select a mediator by agreement or mutual consent.
      It is the function of the mediator to bring the parties together voluntarily under such favorable auspices as will tend to effectuate settlement of the dispute, but neither the mediator nor the labor relations agency has any power of compulsion in mediation proceedings.

       This section’s cost-of-living wage differentials do not violate the federal constitution’s commerce clause since Alaska acted as a “market participant” rather than as a “market regulator.” Int'l Org. of Masters v. Andrews, 626 F. Supp. 1271 (D. Alaska 1986), aff'd in part, vacated in part, 831 F.2d 843 (9th Cir. Alaska 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the existence and amount of the wage differentials imposed under this section reasonably further a legitimate state purpose, the wage differentials do not violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. Int'l Org. of Masters v. Andrews, 626 F. Supp. 1271 (D. Alaska 1986), aff'd in part, vacated in part, 831 F.2d 843 (9th Cir. Alaska 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Imposing wage differentials according to Alaska Marine Highway System (AMHS) employee’s states of residence did not infringe on their “right to travel” guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment since the wage adjustments do not penalize AMHS employees for migrating to or emigrating from Alaska. Int'l Org. of Masters v. Andrews, 626 F. Supp. 1271 (D. Alaska 1986), aff'd in part, vacated in part, 831 F.2d 843 (9th Cir. Alaska 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section’s wage differentials do not violate the privileges and immunities clause because the interest “burdened” by this section’s wage differentials is not “fundamental” in nature, and even if this interest were fundamental for purposes of privileges and immunities analysis, Alaska has a substantial interest in eliminating disincentives that discourage Alaska Marine Highway System employees from residing in the state, and its wage differentials bear a “substantial relationship” to its objective of eliminating, or at least minimizing, these disincentives. Int'l Org. of Masters v. Andrews, 626 F. Supp. 1271 (D. Alaska 1986), aff'd in part, vacated in part, 831 F.2d 843 (9th Cir. Alaska 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section, granting cost of living wage adjustments to resident, but not nonresident employees of the Alaska Marine Highway System, does not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause or the right to travel as embodied in the fourteenth amendment.

       The language of the Public Employment Relations Act mandates that “monetary terms of any agreement” entered into under its provisions “are subject to funding through legislative appropriation.” Since the union does not contend that the geographic differential increases fall outside the definition of a “monetary term of an agreement,” the statute appears to compel legislative approval. Hence, penalties for nonpayment would not accrue until the date when legislative approval is obtained. Public Safety Employees Ass'n, Local 92 v. State, 895 P.2d 980 (Alaska 1995).

       There is nothing in the language of the definition of “organization” which suggests that an otherwise qualified labor organization could not represent two different bargaining units within the same public employer.
       Indeed, the use of the phrase “labor organization of any kind” suggests the contrary. City of Fairbanks v. Alaska Dep't of Labor, 763 P.2d 976 (Alaska 1988).

      <p>
       Since paragraph (3) of this section defines “labor relations agency,” which supervises and enforces this article, as the state personnel board for state employees and the Department of Labor with regard to all other public employees, the state personnel board would be the applicable regulatory agency with regard to ferry personnel.

      <p>
       Although the Alaska State Operated School System, the predecessor to the regional educational attendance areas, was a state agency subject to this article and not a “school district” whose noncertificated employees are exempt under paragraph (6), and therefore did not have a “right” to refuse to bargain which it could waive.
       Even if the Alaska State Operated School System had waived its right to claim exemption under this article, it does not follow that the regional educational attendance areas also have waived their right to assert the statutory exemption, since the regional educational attendance areas are not simply successors to the Alaska State Operated School System but are independent entities which have been given broad powers to run their individual school districts as they see fit. Northwest Arctic Regional Educ. Attendance Area v. Alaska Pub. Serv. Employees, 591 P.2d 1292 (Alaska 1979), overruled, Alaska Commercial Fishing &amp; Agric. Bank v.

       This article may be rejected when all evidence indicates that municipal governments exempted themselves solely for the purpose of retaining local control over their labor relations, and with the clear intent of continuing collective bargaining rather than to interfere with established employee rights. Anchorage Mun. Emples. Ass'n v. Municipality of Anchorage, 618 P.2d 575 (Alaska 1980); City of Sitka v. International Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 653 P.2d 332 (Alaska 1982).

       <b>
        Rejection must be prior to substantial organizational activity by public employees. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is evident from the wording of the exemption provision that the legislature intended to limit the freedom of the political subdivision to consider whether it wishes this article to apply to it by adopting the position that the article must be rejected prior to substantial organizational activity by public employees. State v. City of Petersburg, 538 P.2d 263 (Alaska 1975), limited, Sitka v. International Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 653 P.2d 332 (Alaska 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to becoming aware of substantial organizational activity, the city could have exempted itself from the applicability of this article without interfering with the right of the employees to organize.
       Rejection of this article after becoming aware of such activity constitutes a gross and impermissible interference with the employees’ freedom to choose which collective bargaining association should represent them. State v. City of Petersburg, 538 P.2d 263 (Alaska 1975), limited, Sitka v. International Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 653 P.2d 332 (Alaska 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       This article was intended to recognize the right of employees to organize for the purpose of collective bargaining and to require public employers to negotiate and enter into labor contracts with employee organizations.
       It is apparent that this purpose would be substantially frustrated if a city would wait until the employees elected to be represented by a specific union, and then could exempt itself from the requirements of this article if that union was not favored by the city.
       In effect, this would give the city the right to control the organization to be selected by the employees. State v. City of Petersburg, 538 P.2d 263 (Alaska 1975), limited, Sitka v. International Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 653 P.2d 332 (Alaska 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       A city council cannot validly reject application of this article more than six months after it becomes effective, and after the members of the council have learned of the organizational activity of the city’s power plant employees. State v. City of Petersburg, 538 P.2d 263 (Alaska 1975), limited, Sitka v. International Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 653 P.2d 332 (Alaska 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right and power of a city to reject this article becomes subordinated to the rights of the employees granted by the same legislation once the public employer becomes aware of substantial organizational activity on the part of its employees. Anchorage Mun. Emples. Ass'n v. Municipality of Anchorage, 618 P.2d 575 (Alaska 1980).

        Freedom to develop varying scheme of collective bargaining. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Local governments which have validly rejected this article are free to develop a local scheme of collective bargaining which varies from the state scheme as provided in this article. Anchorage Mun. Emples. Ass'n v. Municipality of Anchorage, 618 P.2d 575 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature has expressly declared that the state policy of promoting harmonious and cooperative relations in public employment relations can best be effectuated by requiring public employers to bargain collectively with their employees. It is, therefore, most difficult to construe this article to prohibit local governments, which effectively rejected the article, from engaging in collective bargaining under their own local ordinances.
       It is far more likely that § 4, ch. 113, SLA 1972 [now AS

       The legislature finds that permitting competing physicians to engage in collective negotiation of certain terms and conditions of contracts with a health benefit plan will benefit competition, so long as the physicians do not engage in an express or implied threat of retaliatory collective action, including boycotts or strikes.

       The legislature finds that permitting physicians to engage in collective negotiations over fee-related terms may, in some circumstances, yield anticompetitive effects. There are, however, instances in which a health benefit plan dominates the market to the degree that fair negotiations between physicians and the health benefit plan are not possible in the absence of joint action on behalf of the physicians. In those circumstances, the health benefit plan can virtually dictate the terms of the contracts that it offers to physicians.
