     <p>
      In the event of war, disaster, insurrection, rebellion, tumult, catastrophe, wildland fire, invasion, or riot; or if a mob or body of men act together by force with intent to commit a felony or to offer violence to persons or property, or by force and violence to break and resist the laws of the state, or the United States; or in the case of imminent danger of the occurrence of any of these events; or whenever responsible civil authorities fail to preserve law and order, or protect life and property, or the governor believes that failure is imminent, the governor may order the organized militia or any part of it, into active state service to execute the laws and to perform duties in connection with them that the governor considers proper. Whenever any portion of the militia is ordered into active state service by the governor, it becomes an additional police force, retaining its separate entity and operating at all times as a military organization under military command, with power to cooperate with but not to supersede the existing civilian law enforcement officers whenever possible, for the re-establishment of law and order and for the protection of life and property. The governor may also order members of the organized militia to active state service, with their consent, for the purpose of training or for full-time duty with the office of the adjutant general. In the event of wildland fire, the governor may delegate to the adjutant general the governor’s authority under this section to order some or all of the organized militia into active state service to fight wildland fire. In this section, “wildland fire” includes the uncontrolled burning of grass, brush, timber, and other vegetative material.

     <p>
      Courts-martial have primary jurisdiction over offenses under this chapter, except when an act or omission violates both this chapter and local criminal law, foreign or domestic. In that case, a court-martial may be initiated only after a civilian authority has declined to prosecute or dismissed the charge, provided jeopardy has not attached. Jurisdiction over attempted crimes, conspiracy crimes, solicitation, and accessory crimes must be determined by the underlying offense. These jurisdictional requirements do not apply to nonjudicial punishment or administrative action taken by military authorities.

      A member of the militia who makes, draws, utters, or delivers a check, draft, or order for the payment of money on a bank or other depository, knowing at the time that the maker or drawer has not or will not have sufficient funds in, or credit with, the bank or other depository for the payment of that check, draft, or order in full on its presentment, with intent to defraud for the procurement of any article or thing of value or with intent to deceive for the payment of a past due obligation or for another purpose, may be punished by up to one year of confinement, by separation with characterization up to dishonorable discharge, and by such other punishment as a court-martial may direct. The making, drawing, uttering, or delivering by a maker or drawer of a check, draft, or order, payment of which is refused by the drawee because of insufficient funds of the maker or drawer in the drawee’s possession or control, is prima facie evidence of the person’s intent to defraud or deceive and of the knowledge of insufficient funds in, or credit with, that bank or other depository, unless the maker or drawer pays the holder the amount due within five days after receiving notice, orally or in writing, that the check, draft, or order was not paid on presentment. In this section, “credit” means an arrangement or understanding, express or implied, with the bank or other depository for the payment of that check, draft, or order.

     A contract transferring property financed by a veterans’ loan to a nonveteran was not expressly prohibited or illegal, and was not void as against public policy. Currington v. Johnson, 685 P.2d 73 (Alaska 1984).
    </p>
    <p>
     Option contract transferring property financed by a veterans’ loan to a nonveteran was not voidable under the doctrine of frustration of purpose because the veterans’ loan could be called due since the veteran’s deed of trust provided for such event, and the veteran therefore clearly had reason to know of the possibility of acceleration of his veterans’ loan at the time the option contract was formed.

        ARTICLE I PURPOSES; DEFINITIONS
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states that enact this compact, which are called party states. For the purposes of this agreement, “states” means the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all United States territorial possessions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is declared by the governor of the affected state or states, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states’ National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.

        ARTICLE II GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdiction boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies that require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources that they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state is the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact are understood.
      </p>
      <p>
       On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management is responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.

       Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms of the compact; however, it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state. Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers, except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state; duties; rights; and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect, or loaned resources remain in the receiving state or states, whichever is longest.

      With regard to the reference to “the federal Disaster Relief Act” in paragraph (8) of this section, most federal disaster relief statutes can be found at 42 U.S.C. 5121 — 5208. Assistance for temporary housing is covered by 42 U.S.C. 5174. However, no definition for the term exists at 42 U.S.C. 5174 or in 42 U.S.C. 5122, which contains most definitions for disaster relief.

      The Alaska Aerospace Development Corporation (AADC) must secure an appropriation from the legislature before expending funds not previously appropriated. This requirement covers interest on the $1,000,000 previously appropriated to the AADC for capitalization, and any other funds that come into the revolving fund. See 1981 Inf. Op. Att’y Gen. (Aug. 21; J-66-590-81). However, because the $1,000,000 capitalization has already been appropriated to the AADC by the legislature in sec. 41, ch. 136, SLA 92, an additional appropriation is unnecessary before expenditure of the $1,000,000. March 15, 1995 Op. Att’y Gen.

     <p>
      The members of the corporation and a person executing the bonds are not liable personally on the bonds by reason of their issuance. The bonds of the corporation are not a debt of the state or a political or municipal corporation or other subdivision of the state, including the University of Alaska, and each bond must so state on its face. Neither the state nor a political or municipal corporation or other subdivision of the state, including the University of Alaska, other than the corporation is liable on the bonds, nor are the bonds payable out of funds or properties other than those of the corporation. The corporation may not pledge the faith of the people of the state for a loan or obligation. Bonds of the corporation are not a debt, indebtedness, or the borrowing of money within the meaning of a limitation or restriction on the issuance of bonds contained in the constitution or laws of the state.

     <p>
      Bonds and notes of the corporation are authorized by adoption of a resolution prescribing the date of issuance and maturity, interest rate, denomination, form, conversion privilege, rank or priority, execution, terms of redemption, medium, and place of payment. Bonds and notes may be sold in the manner, on the terms, and at the price the corporation determines. Each bond and note is negotiable. The signature of a member or an officer upon a bond or note or coupon is not invalidated by that person’s ceasing to hold office before the delivery of the bond or note. The recitation of a bond or note that it has been issued in the financing of a space-related project or purpose under this chapter is conclusive as to the issuance of the bond or note and the character of the project in a challenge of the validity of the bond or note or the security for it.
