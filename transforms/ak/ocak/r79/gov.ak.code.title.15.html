    The provisions of this title were redrafted in 1988 to remove personal pronouns pursuant to § 4, ch. 58, SLA 1982, and in 1988, 2000, 2010, and 2018 to make other minor word changes.
   </p>
   <p>
    In 1971 “secretary of state” was changed to “lieutenant governor” throughout the title in conformity with the 1970 Alaska constitutional amendment (SJR 2) changing the designation of that office.

        Equal right to vote. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A citizen has a constitutionally protected right to participate in elections on an equal basis with other citizens in the jurisdiction. This “equal right to vote” is not absolute; the states have the power to impose voter qualifications, and to regulate access to the franchise in other ways.
       But, as a general matter, before that right to vote can be restricted, the purpose of the restriction and the assertedly overriding interests served by it must meet close constitutional scrutiny. Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S. Ct. 995, 31 L. Ed. 2d 274 (U.S. 1972).
      </p>

       <b>
        Denial of right must promote compelling state interest. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       If a challenged statute grants the right to vote to some citizens and denies the franchise to others, the supreme court must determine whether the exclusions are necessary to promote a compelling state interest. Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S. Ct. 995, 31 L. Ed. 2d 274 (U.S. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        There is a difference between bona fide residence requirements and durational residence requirements.
       </b>
       The states have the power to require that voters be bona fide residents of the relevant political subdivision.
       An appropriately defined and uniformly applied requirement of bona fide residence may be necessary to preserve the basic conception of a political community, and therefore could withstand close constitutional scrutiny.
       But durational residence requirements, representing a separate voting qualification imposed on bona fide residents, must be separately tested by the stringent standard. Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S. Ct. 995, 31 L. Ed. 2d 274 (U.S. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Durational residence laws impermissibly condition and penalize the right to travel
       </b>
       by imposing their prohibitions on only those persons who have recently exercised that right. Absent a compelling state interest, a state may not burden the right to travel in this way. Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S. Ct. 995, 31 L. Ed. 2d 274 (U.S. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Durational residence laws which classify bona fide residents on the basis of recent travel, penalizing those persons, and only those persons, who have gone from one jurisdiction to another during the qualifying period, directly impinge on the exercise of a fundamental personal right, the right to travel. Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S. Ct. 995, 31 L. Ed. 2d 274 (U.S. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       All durational residency requirements are prima facie invalid as in contravention of the equal protection clause because they penalize the right to travel and the right to vote in elections on an equal basis with other citizens in the jurisdiction.
       The only durational residency requirements that will be countenanced are those which are absolutely necessary for administrative purposes. State v. Van Dort, 502 P.2d 453 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        And they must be measured by a strict equal protection test.
       </b>
       They are unconstitutional unless the state can demonstrate that such laws are necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest. Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S. Ct. 995, 31 L. Ed. 2d 274 (U.S. 1972).
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       The United States supreme court upheld a 50-day voter registration cutoff where the state had offered evidence to establish the need for the 50-day period, given the vagaries and numerous requirements of the state election laws, although the 50-day period approached the outer constitutional limits in this area. Burns v. Fortson, 410 U.S. 686, 93 S. Ct. 1209, 35 L. Ed. 2d 633 (U.S. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States supreme court upheld a 50-day durational voter residency requirement and a 50-day voter registration requirement where the state had demonstrated that 50 days rather than 30 days were necessary to promote the state’s important interest in accurate voter lists. Marston v. Lewis, 410 U.S. 679, 93 S. Ct. 1211, 35 L. Ed. 2d 627 (U.S. 1973).

      <p>
       A post office box or private mail service address is clearly not a voter’s fixed place of habitation and is therefore insufficient to fix a voter’s residence within a voting district.
       Thus, any voter providing such an address as his or her residence would be ineligible to vote unless he or she provided additional information regarding that voter’s residence. Fischer v. Stout, 741 P.2d 217 (Alaska 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Elmendorf Air Force Base is a bounded area wholly within Senate District H.
       Thus, merely listing “Elmendorf Air Force Base” is sufficient to fix a voter’s residence to a specific locale within District H. Fischer v. Stout, 741 P.2d 217 (Alaska 1987).

       Rules for determining residence of voter.

     </h3>
     <p>
      For the purpose of determining residence for voting, the place of residence is governed by the following rules:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t15c05s15.05.020ol11">
       A person may not be considered to have gained a residence solely by reason of presence nor may a person lose it solely by reason of absence while in the civil or military service of this state or of the United States or of absence because of marriage to a person engaged in the civil or military service of this state or the United States, while a student at an institution of learning, while in an institution or asylum at public expense, while confined in public prison, while engaged in the navigation of waters of this state or the United States or of the high seas, while residing upon an Indian or military reservation, or while residing in the Alaska Pioneers’ Home or the Alaska Veterans’ Home.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05s15.05.020ol12">
       The residence of a person is that place in which the person’s habitation is fixed, and to which, whenever absent, the person has the intention to return. If a person resides in one place, but does business in another, the former is the person’s place of residence. Temporary work sites do not constitute a dwelling place.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05s15.05.020ol13">
       A change of residence is made only by the act of removal joined with the intent to remain in another place. There can only be one residence.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05s15.05.020ol14">
       A person does not lose residence if the person leaves home and goes to another country, state, or place in this state for temporary purposes only and with the intent of returning.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05s15.05.020ol15">
       A person does not gain residence in any place to which the person comes without the present intention to establish a permanent dwelling at that place.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c05s15.05.020ol16">
       A person loses residence in this state if the person votes in another state’s election, either in person or by absentee ballot, and will not be eligible to vote in this state until again qualifying under AS

       The address of a voter as it appears on the official voter registration record is presumptive evidence of the person’s voting residence. This presumption is negated only if the voter notifies the director in writing of a change of voting residence.

        Votes for state representative cast by voters in an election district from which they had moved were not counted, where, even though they had failed to reregister in their new district, election officials had written notice of a change in their residency. Cissna v. Stout, 931 P.2d 363 (Alaska 1996).
       </p>

        When election officials have written notice of a change in residency, this notice suffices to rebut the presumption of voter residency at the district where that voter previously registered. Cissna v. Stout, 931 P.2d 363 (Alaska 1996).

       <p>
        The address on the official voter registration record must be presumed valid unless the voter provides written notice of a change of address, and the Alaska Supreme Court has liberally construed a voter's residence; the decision to count a voter's ballot based on the presumptive validity of her registration was proper, as she had been registered to vote in that district since 2010. Dodge v. Meyer, 444 P.3d 159 (Alaska 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Voter had been registered to vote in House District 1 since 2004, yet the candidate filed an affidavit from the voter stating that he did not reside in House District 1 before the election; the special master ruled that this affidavit was inadmissible hearsay, and as the rules of evidence applied, the court agreed with the director's recount decision based on the presumptive validity of the voter's registration.

         Post office box or private mail service address is clearly not a voter’s fixed place of habitation

      2016 General Election Ballot Measure No. 1 changed some language in subsection (e) without indicating that it was amending existing statutory language, despite the fact that it also made changes to (e) that did indicate amendments to existing statutory language. Specifically, in the first sentence, the "," following "mail" and the "or" before "by completing", were added by the initiative without an indication that this changed existing statutory language. The legal effect of this is uncertain. The revisor has given effect to the changes that were not indicated and the changes that were indicated in the text of subsection (e) above.

       In the case of
       First Nat’l Bank v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 98 S. Ct. 1407, 55 L. Ed. 2d 707, rehearing denied, 438 U.S. 907, 98 S. Ct. 3126, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1150 (1978), the supreme court of the United States has indicated in unmistakable terms that state disclosure laws pertaining to ballot issues are constitutional.

      </p>
      <p>
       When there is no showing that an individual must remain anonymous with respect to advertising as to ballot propositions because of the possibility of being subject to reprisals, economic or otherwise, the state campaign disclosure laws are not unconstitutional as applied to a contributor hoping to influence the outcome of a ballot issue, because the objective of an informed electorate is sufficiently compelling to overcome an interest in anonymous political expression.

       In the case of
       First Nat’l Bank v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 98 S. Ct. 1407, 55 L. Ed. 2d 707, rehearing denied, 438 U.S. 907, 98 S. Ct. 3126, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1150 (1978), the supreme court of the United States has indicated in unmistakable terms that state disclosure laws pertaining to ballot issues are constitutional.

      </p>
      <p>
       When there is no showing that an individual must remain anonymous with respect to advertising as to ballot propositions because of the possibility of being subject to reprisals, economic or otherwise, the state campaign disclosure laws are not unconstitutional as applied to a contributor hoping to influence the outcome of a ballot issue, because the objective of an informed electorate is sufficiently compelling to overcome an interest in anonymous political expression.

       Alaska Public Offices Commission properly assessed a fine against a national political organization because the organization's actions in engaging an Alaska media consultant to reserve television advertising time prior to a gubernatorial primary race constituted expenditures for the purposes of Alaska's campaign finance registration statutes. Furthermore, the national political organization was not exempt from registration. Republican Governors Ass'n v. Alaska Pub. Offices Comm'n, 485 P.3d 545 (Alaska 2021).

      An initiative petition, known as 17 AKGA, was certified by the Lieutenant Governor to appear on the November 2018 ballot; it related broadly to campaign finance, public official integrity, and good governance. During the legislative session the legislature enacted HB 44 (Chapter 61, SLA 2018), similarly relating, inter alia, to campaign expenditures and contributions, the legislators' per diem, gifts by lobbyists, and voting or other actions by a legislator where the legislator had a conflict of interest.

       The $500 limitation on individual contributions for electoral campaigns in Alaska set forth in subsection (b) is justified by evidence that contribution limits do not place a substantial burden on the ability of candidates to run competitive local or state election campaigns. State v. Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 978 P.2d 597 (Alaska 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1153, 120 S. Ct. 1156, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (U.S. 2000).

       Limits on individuals’ contributions to groups and political parties are reasonable; preventing individuals from channeling their contributions through a group or a party, and thus avoiding the limit on individuals’ contributions to candidates, is a valid purpose.

      <p>
       The limitation in subsection (c), that a “group” that is not a political party may not contribute more than $1,000 per year to a candidate, another group, or a political party, is reasonable. State v. Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 978 P.2d 597 (Alaska 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1153, 120 S. Ct. 1156, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (U.S. 2000).

       Attempting to limit outside influences in Alaska politics is a sufficiently compelling state interest to justify the restrictions on contributions by nonresidents set forth in subsections (a), (e), and (f). State v. Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 978 P.2d 597 (Alaska 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1153, 120 S. Ct. 1156, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (U.S. 2000).

       furthers the sufficiently important state interest of preventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance and the political party aggregate limit does not trigger First Amendment concerns, at least under plaintiffs' theory of the case, those provisions are upheld as constitutional. Thompson v. Dauphinais, 217 F. Supp. 3d 1023 (D. Alaska 2016), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 909 F.3d 1027 (9th Cir. Alaska 2018), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, — F.3d —, 7 F.4th 811 (9th Cir. 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       In action alleging that Alaska law regulating campaign contributions violated First Amendment, individual-to-candidate and individual-to-group contribution limits, as well as annual limits on what political party could contribute to candidate, were upheld because they were narrowly tailored to prevent quid pro quo corruption or its appearance and thus did not impermissibly infringe constitutional rights; annual aggregate limit on contributions candidate could accept from nonresidents of Alaska, which at most, targeted contributors' influence over Alaska politics, did not target important state interest and, therefore, violated First Amendment. Thompson v. Hebdon, 909 F.3d 1027 (9th Cir. Alaska 2018), vacated, — U.S. —, 140 S. Ct. 348, 205 L.

       Alaska has a substantial governmental interest in campaign finance reform that justifies some restriction on First Amendment freedoms, including the ban on contributions by a corporation, company, partnership, firm, association, organization, business trust, surety, or labor union in subsection (f). State v. Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 978 P.2d 597 (Alaska 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1153, 120 S. Ct. 1156, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (U.S. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The restrictions on contributions and expenditures by corporations and labor unions, considered together, are not so extreme as to constitute bans on issue advocacy.
       State v. Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 978 P.2d 597 (Alaska 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1153, 120 S. Ct. 1156, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (U.S. 2000) (Decided under former law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The ban on out-of-district lobbyist contributions in subsection (g) is narrowly tailored to further the State’s compelling interest, and the restraint does not foreclose lobbyists from engaging in political speech. State v. Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 978 P.2d 597 (Alaska 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1153, 120 S. Ct. 1156, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (U.S. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The post-election contribution limits of subsection (c) comprise a narrowly-tailored impact on associational rights to further compelling state interests, and are upheld. State v. Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 978 P.2d 597 (Alaska 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1153, 120 S. Ct. 1156, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (U.S. 2000).

      </p>
      <p>
       Fine assessed against a limited liability company (LLC) for campaign violations was not so excessive that it would violate Alaska or federal law regarding punitive damages because the LLC was a sophisticated entity with substantial assets and knowledgeable management. Its actions called into question the fairness of an election, the fine sent a message that the Alaska Public Offices Commission takes violations seriously and helped deter other corporations from engaging in similar misconduct.

      </p>
      <p>
       Fine assessed against a limited liability company (LLC) for campaign violations bore a reasonable relationship to the alleged offense because there was no requirement that a violator of campaign laws must be made aware that it violated the law before a fine can be imposed; even if the LLC was unaware, a fine calculated based on the time it was unaware of the violation still served a punitive function even if it did not serve a remedial function.

      <p>
       The prohibition against making contributions to legislative candidates, including both challengers and incumbents, during a regular legislative session, set forth in paragraph (c)(2), is not narrowly tailored to the State’s compelling interest of preventing corruption or its appearance, and is therefore invalid. State v. Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 978 P.2d 597 (Alaska 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1153, 120 S. Ct. 1156, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (U.S. 2000).

       Chapter 48, SLA 1996, which revised Alaska’s election campaign finance laws, provides both a severability clause and contingent provisions to become effective if parts of the act are held invalid; thus, invalidation of some parts of the act does not undermine the structure of the whole, and legal effect can be given to the remaining provisions.

       Alaska Public Offices Commission properly fined a city council member for improper use of government resources in violation of the statute because its interpretation of the statute, that "to influence" meant "for the purpose of influencing," was both reasonable and in keeping with the general rule that courts not read additional terms into a statute.
       Eberhart v. Alaska Pub. Offices Comm'n, 426 P.3d 890 (Alaska 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       The word "to" appears on the face of the statute, and one of its common meanings entails purpose or intent; the phrase "to influence the outcome of the election" does not require proof of actual influence.

       Alaska Public Offices Commission (APOC) properly fined a city council member for improper use of government resources during his campaign for mayor because it was reasonable for APOC to interpret "money" to include property and assets including a city's email system; the most reasonable interpretation of the term "money," given the definition in
       Alaska Admin. Code tit. 2, § 50.356(d), includes the use of a city-established and maintained resource like the email system.

      <p>
       Alaska Public Offices Commission properly fined a city council member for improper use of government resources during his campaign for mayor because it was not a violation of the First Amendment to enforce the statute without a finding that the member engaged in corruption.
       Eberhart v. Alaska Pub. Offices Comm'n, 426 P.3d 890 (Alaska 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska Public Offices Commission did not violate a city council member's First Amendment rights by applying the statute to actions that fell within a council member's unusual duties because imposing a fine on the member for inappropriate use of his city email account did not undermine his ability to be an effective advocate for his constituents as a sitting member of the city council.

        Substantial compliance standard does not apply to statute. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Adoption of the substantial compliance standard was unnecessary because a city council member did not show that the substantial compliance standard for filing disclosures applied to the statute; the sanction applied to the member's failure to strictly comply with the statute was a fine, and more serious violators faced only increased fines, not the forfeiture of election results.

Notwithstanding the absence of a request to expedite consideration, the commission may independently expedite consideration of the complaint if the commission finds that the standards for expedited consideration set out in this subsection have been met.

        Subsection (b), which contained a forfeiture sanction for violation of AS 15.13, was repealed in 1982.

        <b>
         Constitutionality of forfeiture sanction. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The forfeiture sanction of subsection (b) (now repealed) does not conflict with any constitutional provision delimiting the qualifications of assembly or council members or with any provision reserving exclusive authority to determine a member’s election to those local entities. State v. Marshall, 633 P.2d 227 (Alaska 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if the forfeiture sanction of subsection (b) (now repealed) may conflict with Alaska Const., art. II, § 12, insofar as state legislative elections are concerned, it can nonetheless constitutionally apply to local elections. State v. Marshall, 633 P.2d 227 (Alaska 1981).
       </p>

        <b>
         The forfeiture sanction is valid.

       <p>
        <b>
         The deadlines for filing are mandatory,
        </b>
        and the plain meaning of this section makes the forfeiture sanction applicable. State v. Marshall, 633 P.2d 227 (Alaska 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory forfeiture of office provision applied to the election of a city councilman and borough assemblyman whose 1980 seven-day pre-election report was not filed until well after the election. State v. Marshall, 633 P.2d 227 (Alaska 1981).

       <p>
        <b>
         The absence of regulations is not fatal

       In action alleging that Alaska law regulating campaign contributions violated First Amendment, individual-to-candidate and individual-to-group contribution limits, as well as annual limits on what political party could contribute to candidate, were upheld because they were narrowly tailored to prevent quid pro quo corruption or its appearance and thus did not impermissibly infringe constitutional rights; annual aggregate limit on contributions candidate could accept from nonresidents of Alaska, which at most, targeted contributors' influence over Alaska politics, did not target important state interest and, therefore, violated First Amendment.

       This section mandates that the write-in voter mark the oval in some fashion; a blank oval would invalidate the vote, and writing in the name but not marking the oval was not compliant with the statute, such that the candidate was not entitled to declaratory judgment that AS

       Abbreviations, misspellings, or other minor variations in the form of the name of a candidate should be disregarded in determining the validity of the ballot, so long as the intention of the voter could be ascertained; this interpretation treats overseas and domestic Alaskan voters equally, ensuring that each write-in vote is treated equally and counted in the same manner. Miller v. Treadwell, 245 P.3d 867 (Alaska 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       State officials’ action in establishing a policy of counting write-in votes with misspellings, in apparent contravention of this section, did not violate U.S. Const. art. I, § 4, cl. 1, where the Alaska Supreme Court’s interpretation of the poorly drafted statute was plausible. The federal court declined to second-guess findings that the candidate’s statutory interpretation would have eroded the integrity of the election system and that voter intent was paramount. It further refused to find that the Alaska Supreme Court’s interpretation was in violation of the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution. Miller v. Treadwell, 736 F. Supp. 2d 1240 (D. Alaska 2010).

      <p>
       Voter's intent was not clear since both the X and filled-in oval were valid marks for selecting a candidate, and the voter used valid marks in the ovals for each candidate; therefore, the ballot had been over-marked, and not counting this ballot was proper.

       Two ballots were improperly categorized as containing overvotes where the voters had completely shaded the ovals for the candidate and all other races on the ballot, there was only a trace touching the edge of the oval next to the opponent’s name, and thus, the voters had clearly intended to vote for only one candidate. Edgmon v. State, 152 P.3d 1154 (Alaska 2007).

      <p>
       Ballot was improperly categorized as containing overvotes where the voter had placed an “X” in the oval next to a candidate’s name, the “X” was consistent with the votes cast on the remainder of the ballot, and thus, the line striking through the opponent’s name and the oval next to it was not a vote for that candidate.

       The over-all effect of former paragraph of this section was that of adding to the qualifications established by U.S. Const., art.

     <p>
      The state ballot counting review shall begin as soon as practicable after the election is completed and not later than 16 days after an election and shall be continued until completed. The director may designate the hours each day during which the state ballot counting review board is to conduct its ballot counting review. The director shall close the review when the director is satisfied that no missing precinct certificate of election would, if received, change the result of the election. If no election certificate has been received from a precinct, the director may secure from the election supervisors and may count a certified copy of the duplicate election certificate of the precinct. If no election materials have been received, but election results have been received by telephone or radio, the director shall count the election results so received. If the director has reason to believe that a missing precinct certificate, if received, would affect the result of the election, the director shall await the receipt of the certificate until the close of business on the 15th day after the date of election. A certificate not actually delivered to the director by the close of business on the 15th day after the election may not be counted at the state ballot counting review.

        Purpose of section. —

      </p>
      <p>
       One purpose of this section is to insure that the ballot was marked by the voter, and not someone else, in circumstances free from coercion.
       Given that objective, it would make no sense to require secret voting in the presence of an official, while waiving the presence requirement when two non-official witnesses are used. Finkelstein v. Stout, 774 P.2d 786 (Alaska 1989), overruled in part, Nageak v. Mallott, 426 P.3d 930 (Alaska 2018).

      </p>
      <p>
       Signing in the presence of the attestor was a condition of ballot validity: subsection (d) provides that an absentee ballot will be valid only if the ballot envelope is signed by the voter in the presence of an attesting officer.

      <p>
       The mandatory requirement of former AS 15.20.150 that ballots be marked on or before election day was satisfied by a date received stamp, or a postmark, or the date of witnessing of the voter certificate, or any combination of these. Hammond v. Hickel, 588 P.2d 256 (Alaska 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 907, 99 S. Ct. 1998, 60 L. Ed. 2d 376 (U.S. 1979).

       by an election official was not included as a violation of the absentee ballot statute mandating the canvass board to invalidate the ballot. Hammond v.

       The voter’s signature is a basic part of the certificate

       Even assuming election officials were negligent and were at fault for a voter’s late receipt of a ballot, the ballot was properly rejected where it was postmarked two days after the primary election. Cissna v. Stout, 931 P.2d 363 (Alaska 1996).

       The failure of the absentee ballot to be properly postmarked or dated when received
       
       by an election official was not included as a violation of the absentee ballot statute mandating the canvass board to invalidate the ballot. Hammond v. Hickel, 588 P.2d 256 (Alaska 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 907, 99 S. Ct. 1998, 60 L. Ed. 2d 376 (U.S. 1979) (decided under former AS

       Under the provisions of Alaska’s Election Code, the legislature has authorized election contests, placed jurisdiction over such contests in the superior court, and has specified the content of the judgments which are to be entered. These provisions of Alaska’s Election Code are not atypical; rather, they reflect the role American courts have played in the resolution of election contest issues. Boucher v. Bomhoff, 495 P.2d 77 (Alaska 1972).

        An election contest and recount appeal are distinct proceedings.
       </b>
       In an election contest where no fraud, corruption or ineligibility of a party is alleged, the evidence presented must demonstrate the existence of malconduct sufficient to change the results of the election.
       In contrast, the inquiry in a recount appeal is whether specific votes or classes of votes were properly counted or rejected.
       The concept of malconduct does not enter into the question, except insofar as particular acts or shortcomings of election officials may have resulted in the improper counting or rejecting of votes. Willis v. Thomas, 600 P.2d 1079 (Alaska 1979).

        “Malconduct,”

       as used in this section, means a significant deviation from statutorily or constitutionally prescribed norms. Hammond v. Hickel, 588 P.2d 256 (Alaska 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 907, 99 S. Ct. 1998, 60 L. Ed. 2d 376 (U.S. 1979).

       <b>
        If a bias has been introduced into the vote,
       </b>
       “malconduct” exists if the bias can be shown to be the result of a significant deviation from lawfully prescribed norms. Hammond v. Hickel, 588 P.2d 256 (Alaska 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 907, 99 S. Ct. 1998, 60 L. Ed. 2d 376 (U.S. 1979).

       <b>
        Irregularities containing no element of bias,
       </b>
       even if they amount to significant deviations from prescribed norms, do not necessarily constitute malconduct. Hammond v. Hickel, 588 P.2d 256 (Alaska 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 907, 99 S. Ct. 1998, 60 L. Ed. 2d 376 (U.S. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Significant deviations which impact randomly on voter behavior will amount to malconduct if the significant deviations from prescribed norms by election officials are imbued with scienter, a knowing noncompliance with the law or a reckless indifference to norms established by law.
       Thus, evidence of an election official’s good faith may preclude a finding of malconduct under certain circumstances. Hammond v. Hickel, 588 P.2d 256 (Alaska 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 907, 99 S. Ct. 1998, 60 L. Ed. 2d 376 (U.S. 1979).

      <p>
       Each alleged deviation from a statutorily or constitutionally prescribed norm must be analyzed individually to determine if it is “significant” and to ascertain if it involves an element of scienter. Once it is determined that the individual instance of noncompliance amounts to malconduct, a determination must be made of the number of votes affected. The total number of votes affected by all such incidents must then be considered in ascertaining whether they are sufficient to change the result of the election. Hammond v. Hickel, 588 P.2d 256 (Alaska 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 907, 99 S. Ct. 1998, 60 L. Ed. 2d 376 (U.S. 1979).

       In rare circumstances, an election may be so permeated with numerous serious violations of law, not individually amounting to malconduct, that substantial doubt will be cast on the outcome of the vote.
       Under such circumstances, cumulation of irregularities may be proper and will support a finding of malconduct. Hammond v. Hickel, 588 P.2d 256 (Alaska 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 907, 99 S. Ct. 1998, 60 L. Ed. 2d 376 (U.S. 1979).

      Constitutionality. —

    </p>
    <p>
     Alaska’s blanket primary statute is constitutional, and does not violate the first amendment associational rights of a political party solely by virtue of the fact that the statute conflicts with party rules pertaining to the primary. The blanket primary is nondiscriminatory. While the blanket primary may create some degree of interference with a political party’s associational rights, this interference is minor and is justified by the state’s interests. O'Callaghan v. State, 914 P.2d 1250 (Alaska 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1209, 117 S. Ct. 1690, 137 L. Ed. 2d 818 (U.S. 1997).
    </p>
    <p>
     The state’s interests in encouraging voter turnout, maximizing voters’ choice among candidates, and ensuring that elected officials have relatively broad based constituencies are served by the blanket primary statute. These interests are important and are legitimate objectives for a state to seek to achieve when structuring election procedures. O'Callaghan v. State, 914 P.2d 1250 (Alaska 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1209, 117 S. Ct. 1690, 137 L. Ed. 2d 818 (U.S. 1997).

      <p>
       Political party had an associational right to choose its general election nominees and that right could include allowing independents to run in its primary elections. Because the Alaska Constitution's free association guarantee protected the party's choice to open its primary elections to independent voter candidates, and because in this specific context the State had no countervailing need to enforce the party affiliation rule, the superior court properly ruled in favor of the party in its suit for declaratory and injunctive relief preventing enforcement of the party affiliation rule.

       Where a political party’s bylaw allowing for the selection of a candidate by the central committee only came into play if state law authorized the party to nominate a candidate, it did not conflict with state laws providing for a blanket primary.

       Summary judgment for Alaska was proper in an action under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 filed by political parties alleging violation of their U.S. Const. amend. I association rights; Alaska’s mandatory direct primary election system under this section and AS 15.25.014(a) is facially constitutional because it is justified by compelling state interests of avoiding fraud and corruption and promoting democratic decision-making.

I, § 5 because they substantially burdened the political parties’ rights to determine who could participate in its primary. The state’s justification for imposing the burden was insufficient because most of the state’s interests were too abstract to support that burden; and the remainder of the state’s interests were not closely related to the prohibition on combined ballots.

       that a candidate must be a registered member of the political party whose nomination is being sought was found unconstitutional by the superior court, and this judgment was affirmed by the supreme court. The act of formal enrollment or public affiliation with a political party is merely one element in the continuum of participation in party affairs, and need not be in any sense the most important. It is not sufficient for the State to assert theoretical possibilities, albeit undesirable ones, to justify incursions upon free speech rights protected by the Alaska Constitution.

       Summary judgment for Alaska was proper in an action under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 filed by political parties alleging violation of their U.S. Const. amend. I association rights; because the parties provided no support for their claim that their own bylaws conflicted with the definition of party membership under subsection (a)(16), they waived their claim that Alaska’s party affiliation rule burdened their associational rights.

       According to the holding in

       </i>
       120 S. Ct. 2402, 2414, 147 L. Ed. 2d 502 (2000), the freedom of association guaranteed by the First Amendment prohibits a statutory ballot that, like the ballot prescribed in this section, allows voters who are not party members to vote in a primary election for candidates of a party that does not consent to the non-members voting. O'Callaghan v. Director of Elections, 6 P.3d 728 (Alaska 2000).

      <p>
       The partially closed primary does not violate the Alaska Constitution’s guarantee that “secrecy of voting” shall be preserved, because as long as the Division of Elections takes the necessary steps to prevent individual voters’ ballot preferences from becoming a matter of public record, the partially closed ballot will not impermissibly infringe the voting secrecy clause in Alaska Const., art. V, § 3. O'Callaghan v. Director of Elections, 6 P.3d 728 (Alaska 2000).

       , which required each political party to have a separate ballot on which only candidates of that political party appeared, violated the political parties’ associational rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and violated Alaska Const., art. I, § 5 because they substantially burdened the political parties’ rights to determine who could participate in its primary. The state’s justification for imposing the burden was insufficient because most of the state’s interests were too abstract to support that burden; and the remainder of the state’s interests were not closely related to the prohibition on combined ballots.

       and this section, has not acquired a peculiar meaning by virtue of statutory definition or judicial construction; it is to be construed in accordance with its common usage. The Election Code refers to the declaration as something that each judge shall file, meaning to deliver a legal document for placement into the official record; thus, the phrase “declaration of candidacy” refers to a document that, at a minimum, must contain a personal, affirmative declaration of the judge to be a candidate.

       This section restricts subjects for initiatives, and mirrors article XI, section 7 of the Alaska Constitution. Therefore, it was applicable to an initiative for restriction of commercial set net fishing in nonsubsistence areas, which was, in effect, a prohibited appropriation. Nonmonetary state assets such as fish may be the subject of appropriations, a power reserved to the legislature.

       Although the lieutenant governor prepared a defective summary for the Parental Involvement Initiative, a corrected summary could be placed on the ballot without requiring the sponsors to recirculate the petition because petition-signer inadvertence was unlikely or minimal, despite the omission of punishment as a felony for physicians in violation. Planned Parenthood v. Campbell, 232 P.3d 725 (Alaska 2010).

       Cost statement provided an accurate estimate of the likely insignificant costs associated with implementation of the initiative and was not defective.
       Pebble L.P. v. Parnell, 215 P.3d 1064 (Alaska 2009), overruled in part, Mallott v. Stand for Salmon, 431 P.3d 159 (Alaska 2018).

       Summary’s prediction as to proposed bill’s effect was amply supported by text of bill, consequently the summary’s use of the language “would prevent” was neither misleading nor inaccurate. Burgess v. Miller, 654 P.2d 273 (Alaska 1982).

      <p>
       Challenger did not meet its burden of showing the inadequacy of the summary prepared by the lieutenant governor for the proposed initiative; the summary provided an accurate depiction of the scope and substance of the initiative, and the superior court correctly concluded that it was a fair, true, neutral, and impartial explanation of the main features of the initiative’s contents.

      , where an act of the legislature is substantially the same as a petition, is enacted after the petition has been filed and before the date of the election, the petition is void. Following the passage of HB 44, the Lieutenant Governor determined, and the Attorney General agreed, that the initiative petition known as 17 AKGA, and HB 44, were substantially the same, rendering 17 AKGA void and ineligible to appear on the ballot. 2018 Op.

       Delegation to the lieutenant governor of the authority to determine whether an act and an initiative are substantially the same is based on sound, practical considerations, is to a logical governmental officer, and is definitionally narrow. Warren v. Boucher, 543 P.2d 731 (Alaska 1975).

       Alaska Const., art. V, § 3, art. XI, § 4 and art. XII, § 11, when read in harmony, give the legislature the power to enact a method of determining whether an act and an initiative are “substantially the same,” as used in Alaska Const., art. XI, § 4.

       Substantial similarity existed between ch. 76, SLA 1974, which enacted ch. 13 of Title 15, relating to election campaigns, and an initiative relating to campaign contributions and expenditures, which was filed with the lieutenant governor prior to the regular 1974 session of the legislature.
       The act effectively displaced the initiative, and the lieutenant governor was correct in withholding the initiative from the ballot. Warren v. Boucher, 543 P.2d 731 (Alaska 1975).

      It was recommended that a petition for recall of a state senator not be certified where, in the summary of grounds for recall, allegations that the senator had been paid by a private company for his advice and loyalty while serving as senator did not constitute an adequate factual or legal basis for determining unfitness to serve or corruption, even where the company was one which was potentially affected by the actions of the legislature. 2006 Inf.

      Proper subject for amendment. —

     A legislative resolve to amend the recognition of marriage in the state was sufficiently limited in both quantity and effect of change as to be a proper subject for a constitutional amendment, since few sections of the state Constitution were affected, and nothing in the proposal would necessarily or inevitably alter the basic government framework of the Constitution.

     A ballot measure designed to alter the reapportionment scheme of the state Constitution, although a significant change in the system of state government, did not deprive the executive branch of its foundational power to enforce the laws of the state, and thus the proposal did not constitute a revision.

      In each race, you may vote for any candidate listed. If a primary election was held for a state office, United States senator, or United States representative, the four candidates who received the most votes for the office in the primary election advanced to the general election. However, if one of the four candidates who received the most votes for an office at the primary election died, withdrew, resigned, was disqualified, or was certified as incapacitated 64 days or more before the general election, the candidate who received the fifth most votes for the office advanced to the general election.

      At the general election, each candidate will be selected through a ranked-choice voting process and the candidate with the greatest number of votes will be elected. For a general election, you must rank the candidates in the numerical order of your preference, ranking as many candidates as you wish. Your second, third, and subsequent ranked choices will be counted only if the candidate you ranked first does not receive enough votes to continue on to the next round of counting, so ranking a second, third, or subsequent choice will not hurt your first-choice candidate. Your ballot will be counted regardless of whether you choose to rank one, two, or more candidates for each office, but it will not be counted if you assign the same ranking to more than one candidate for the same office.

       The definition of “political party,” as amended by § 44, ch. 85, SLA 1986, includes as an element receipt of three percent of the votes cast in the preceding gubernatorial election.
       A ten percent polling requirement was in effect when Vogler v. Miller, Sup. Ct. Op. No. 2639 (File No. 6959), 660 P.2d 1192 (1983), annotated below, was decided.

        Ten percent polling requirement for defining “political party” unconstitutional. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The eligibility of a party to nominate a candidate for governor through a primary election may not constitutionally be conditioned on that party’s receipt of 10 percent of the votes cast in the preceding gubernatorial election. Vogler v. Miller, 660 P.2d 1192 (Alaska 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 10 percent polling requirement for defining “political party” may not be justified by the asserted state interests in promoting a two-party system in order to encourage compromise and political stability in ensuring that public officials are elected by a majority of the voters. Vogler v. Miller, 660 P.2d 1192 (Alaska 1983).

        Constitutionality of three percent requirement. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Third-party candidate failed to show that the legislature acted unreasonably in setting a three percent requirement for political party status under this section; preliminary injunction was improper where he did not establish a clear probability of success on the merits of his claim that state ballot access laws were unconstitutional. State v. Metcalfe, 110 P.3d 976 (Alaska 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       A constitutional challenge to the former definition of “political party” in this section, restricting political party status to groups which attained at least three percent of the votes polled in the last gubernatorial election, or registered the equivalent number of voters, was not rendered moot by subsequent amendment of the definition, where the governor’s office would again be the touchstone office for the elections in 2007 and 2008, and therefore the legal controversy remained alive. Green Party of Alaska v. State, 147 P.3d 728 (Alaska 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory requirement that a group attain at least three percent of the votes polled in the last gubernatorial election, or register the equivalent number of voters, to be recognized as a political party was constitutional because: (1) The voters were not totally deprived of the opportunity to place candidates on the ballot; (2) the state’s interest in requiring a significant modicum of support was compelling because it helped avoid confusion, deception, and frustration of the democratic process at the general election; and (3) the requirement was sufficiently narrowly tailored to the state’s interests to justify burdening the voters’ rights. Green Party of Alaska v. State, 147 P.3d 728 (Alaska 2006).

      </p>
      <p>
       The 10 percent polling requirement for defining “political party” may not be justified by the state interest in requiring some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support before printing the name of a political organization’s candidate on the ballot since the state has not established that this interest could not have been served by a requirement substantially smaller than 10 percent.
