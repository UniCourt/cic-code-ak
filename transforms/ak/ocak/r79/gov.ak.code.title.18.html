       Federal law defines a skilled nursing facility in a manner which includes such facilities when they are contained in larger institutions such as pioneer homes.
   Alaska state law was meant to be no less comprehensive.
   South Cent. Health Planning &amp; Dev., Inc. v. Commissioner of Dep’t of Admin., 628 P.2d 551 (Alaska 1981)(Decided prior to 1981 amendment, which added subparagraph (9)(A) [now (8)(A)]
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (8) does not violate equal protection under Alaska Const. art. I, § 1, because it does not treat similarly situated entities differently; it does not distinguish between radiologists and other specialists in defining health care facilities that are required to obtain a certificate of need. Bridges v. Banner Health, 201 P.3d 484 (Alaska 2008), modified, — P.3d — (Alaska 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because subsection (8), defining facilities required to apply for a certificate of need, applied uniformly to any entity seeking to construct an independent diagnostic testing facility and did not specifically target defendant facility, and the class covered by the statute would grow if additional health care providers sought to construct independent diagnostic testing facilities, the statute did not create a closed class or violate the constitutional prohibition against special acts under Alaska Const. art. II, § 19. Bridges v. Banner Health, 201 P.3d 484 (Alaska 2008), modified, — P.3d — (Alaska 2009).

       In 1986, the section was reorganized to conform to the style of the Alaska Statutes. Subsection (b) was formerly the last sentence of (a); subsection (c) was formerly (b); and former subsection (d) was formerly the second sentence of (a).

      <p>
       2010 Primary Election Ballot Measure 2 changed some language in (a)(3) without indicating that it was amending existing statutory language, despite the fact that it also made changes to (a)(3) that did indicate amendments to existing statutory language.
   Specifically, “woman under 18 years of age” was substituted for “woman under 17 years of age” in two places and “proceed with” was substituted for “consent to”, without an indication that this changed existing statutory language.
   The legal effect of this discrepancy is for the courts to determine.
   In the absence of a controlling judicial decision, the language of 2010 Primary Election Ballot Measure 2—both the changes that were indicated and the changes that were not indicated—is set out in the text of the statute above.

       Subsection (b) is unconstitutional to the extent it applies to quasi-public institutions. Valley Hosp. Ass'n v. Mat-Su Coalition for Choice, 948 P.2d 963 (Alaska 1997).
      </p>

       The Alaska Parental Consent Act (PCA), AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c16s18.16.010" target="_self">18.16.010</a></cite> et seq., violates minors’ fundamental right to privacy under article 1, section 22 of the Alaska Constitution. The state has a compelling interest in protecting minors from their own immaturity and in aiding parents in fulfilling their parental responsibilities; however, the PCA is not the least restrictive means of achieving these interests.
   The parental consent requirement represents a “veto power” over the minor, is more intrusive and restrictive than a notification provision, and cannot be sustained. State v. Planned Parenthood, 171 P.3d 577 (Alaska 2007) (Decided prior to 2010 amendments).
      </p>
      <p>
       7 AAC 43.140, which denied Medicaid assistance for medically necessary abortions unless the pregnant woman was at risk of dying or her pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, impermissibly interfered with Medicaid-eligible women’s constitutional rights to privacy and was violative of
   Alaska Const., art. I, § 1. The State failed to articulate a compelling state interest for this interference. The mere fact that the legislature’s appropriations power underlies Medicaid funding could not insulate the program from constitutional review.
   Dep't of Health &amp; Soc. Servs. v. Planned Parenthood of Alaska, Inc., 28 P.3d 904 (Alaska 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Parental Notification Law (Notification Law) violated equal protection because (1) the Notification Law burdened a class of pregnant minors' fundamental privacy rights, and (2) vindicating the State's compelling interests in encouraging parental involvement in minors' pregnancy-related decisions, minors' physical and mental health, or protecting minors from sexual abuse did not justify a distinction between minors seeking to terminate a pregnancy and minors seeking to carry to term, as these interests were implicated for all pregnant minors and the asserted justifications were unconvincing.

       Although the lieutenant governor prepared a defective summary for the Parental Involvement Initiative, a revised summary could be placed on the ballot without requiring the sponsors to recirculate the petition, provided that the summary was corrected and that the Act and the enforcement provisions were made available to the voters.

       The Alaska Parental Consent Act (PCA),
   AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c16s18.16.010" target="_self">18.16.010</a></cite> et seq., violates minors’ fundamental right to privacy under
   article 1, section 22 of the Alaska Constitution. The state has a compelling interest in protecting minors from their own immaturity and in aiding parents in fulfilling their parental responsibilities; however, the PCA is not the least restrictive means of achieving these interests. The parental consent requirement represents a “veto power” over the minor, is more intrusive and restrictive than a notification provision, and cannot be sustained.

      </p>
      <p>
       2010 Primary Election Ballot Measure 2 changed some language in (a) and (b)(2) without indicating that it was amending existing statutory language, despite the fact that it also made changes to (a) and (b) that did indicate amendments to existing statutory language.
   Specifically, “woman under 18 years of age” was substituted for “woman under 17 years of age” without an indication that this changed existing statutory language. The legal effect of this discrepancy is for the courts to determine.
   In the absence of a controlling judicial decision, the language of 2010 Primary Election Ballot Measure 2—both the changes that were indicated and the changes that were not indicated—is set out in the text of the statute above.

      <p>
       In a physician’s action alleging breach of contract, the superior court properly granted summary judgment in favor of a hospital and doctors on the ground they were immune from suit because the physician did not demonstrate a material factual dispute that the executive committee members’ investigation was unreasonable; the executive committee based its decision to terminate the physician’s privileges on the medical board’s order, and the uncontradicted fact that he had not reported the order.

Furthermore, AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.47.html#t47c17s47.17.020" target="_blank">47.17.020</a></cite>, which requires the reporting of suspected child abuse or neglect, does not apply to members of the committee while they are acting in their role as IMRC committee members.

       First sentence of AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c23a01s18.23.010ol1a" target="_self">18.23.010(a)</a></cite> protects from discovery all data and information acquired by a review organization in the exercise of its duties and functions. This sentence appears to include a review organization's investigative process. Such information might include statements made by a doctor under investigation, statements made by other medical staff during an investigation, and information acquired to assess a physician's fitness to practice.

   AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c23a01s18.23.010ol1a" target="_self">18.23.010(a)</a></cite> applies to a different step of the review process; it protects what transpired at a meeting of a review organization. A member of a review organization may not disclose what transpired at a meeting of a review organization except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of a review organization, and the proceedings and records of a review organization are not subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in a civil action against a health care provider arising out of the matter that is the subject of consideration by the review organization.
   Mat-Su Valley Med. Ctr. v. Bolinder, 427 P.3d 754 (Alaska 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Final sentence of
   subsection (a) of this section limits the scope of the privilege defined in the first two sentences; the privilege does not extend to original sources or to matters within a person's knowledge even if the person served on a review organization or testified during a proceeding.
   Mat-Su Valley Med. Ctr. v. Bolinder, 427 P.3d 754 (Alaska 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) of this section sets out three conditions that a piece of evidence must satisfy for the privilege to apply. First, the peer review committee from which the evidence is sought must be a review organization. Under the second condition, the evidence must fall into at least one of the two protected categories of information: (1) data and information acquired by a review organization in the exercise of its duties and functions, or (2) what transpired at a meeting of a review organization and the proceedings and records of a review organization if this category of information is sought in a civil action against a healthcare provider arising out of the matter that is subject of consideration by the review organization. For the privilege in subsection (a) of this section to apply, the evidence must not be otherwise available from original sources or within an individual's personal knowledge.
   Mat-Su Valley Med. Ctr. v. Bolinder, 427 P.3d 754 (Alaska 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Protection for the first category of information under subsection (a) of this section is unqualified; it applies in all cases. In contrast, the second category of information is protected only in certain cases: civil actions against health care providers arising out of the matter that is the subject of consideration by the review organization.
   Mat-Su Valley Med. Ctr. v. Bolinder, 427 P.3d 754 (Alaska 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plain language of subsection (a) of this section supports a broader construction of the privilege that protects complaint-related materials contained in peer review committee files, even if those materials were not generated by the peer review committee but rather originated outside the peer review process.
   Mat-Su Valley Med. Ctr. v. Bolinder, 427 P.3d 754 (Alaska 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Complaint-related materials contained in peer review committee files, the identities of the individuals reporting and reviewing the complaints, and any internal action taken in response satisfy the requirements for the subsection (a) of this section privilege to apply.
   Mat-Su Valley Med. Ctr. v. Bolinder, 427 P.3d 754 (Alaska 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Original source limitation of subsection (a) of this section is interpreted to permit discovery of original source information only from the original source or the individual with personal knowledge. The limitation does not require a peer review committee or its members to disclose these materials.
   Mat-Su Valley Med. Ctr. v. Bolinder, 427 P.3d 754 (Alaska 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       The privilege in subsection (a) of this section does not extend to an individual's personal observations and knowledge derived outside the peer review process even if the individual serves on a review organization or the information relates to a matter under review.

     <p>
      A pledge of revenue or other money, obligations, or assets by the authority is binding from the time the pledge is made as against any parties having subsequent claims in tort, contract, or otherwise, irrespective of whether those parties have actual notice of the prior pledge. The pledge must be noted in the board’s minute book and is constructive notice to all parties. Neither the resolution nor other instrument by which a pledge is created need be otherwise recorded, nor is the filing of any financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code or other law required to perfect the pledge. Revenue, rent, or other money, obligations, or assets so pledged and later received by the authority are immediately subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery or further act.

       Where a husband filed a divorce complaint and supporting affidavit stating that he was not the natural father of a child born during his marriage, the court entered findings that both parties acknowledged that the husband was not the biological father of the child; these findings were sufficient to disestablish the father’s biological paternity with regard to the child.

       Although some provisions of a bill (see ch. 140, SLA 1986, enacting this article) which would have accorded adopted persons who are 18 years of age or older a statutory right to a potentially substantial amount of information about their “natural” parents, and which would make it clear that Alaska’s adoption statutes do not prohibit court-sanctioned post-adoption visitation between adopted persons and their natural parents and relatives, could have engendered a constitutional challenge, the challenge would not have been fatal to the entire bill.

The recitation of a bond or note that it has been issued in the financing of a housing or public building project under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c55a01s18.55.010" target="_self">18.55.010</a></cite> — <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c55a01s18.55.290" target="_self">18.55.290</a></cite> is conclusive as to the issuance of the bond or note and the character of the project in a challenge of the validity of the bond or note or the security for it.

The notice must identify the area and must state that the further information that is available may be obtained at the office of the corporation. The corporation shall consider all redevelopment proposals and the financial and legal ability of the prospective redevelopers to carry out their proposals and may negotiate with redevelopers for proposals for the purchase or lease of real property in the redevelopment project area. The corporation may accept the redevelopment contract proposal it considers in the public interest and in furtherance of the purposes of AS 18.55.480 — 18.55.960, provided that the corporation has given to the governing body at least 30 days’ written notice of its intent to accept the redevelopment contract proposal.

   This obligation is not a mortgage.
   The obligation is specifically enforceable.
   The contract may provide that in case of the conveyance, the federal government may complete, operate, manage, lease, convey, or otherwise deal with the redevelopment project in accordance with the terms of the contract; however, it shall then require that, as soon as practicable after the federal government is satisfied that all defaults have been cured and that the redevelopment project will be operated in accordance with the terms of the contract, the federal government shall reconvey the redevelopment project to the corporation.

       The Pacific Rim Housing Authority appropriately may be considered a political subdivision of the state or other “related public entity” for purposes of Subpart F (15 CFR § 930.90) for the limited purpose of its receipt of federal grants for housing projects; and, thus, Pacific Rim is subject to the coastal management consistency review required by Subpart F for federal assistance programs to the extent that grants are used to fund housing and related programs which affect the coastal zone.

       While various specified Native associations are given authority to establish regional housing authorities under this section, and may receive donations of land from municipalities, the programs administered by those associations must be racially neutral.

       It is quite clear that the annual audits of regional housing authorities mandated by subsection (i) cannot be funded by the Department of Community and Regional Affairs with the housing supplemental development fund moneys; and it must be concluded that department fund should not be used for post-project cost certification.

       There is created in the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation a supplemental housing development grant fund. Using corporate earnings or other available funds, the corporation shall make grants to regional housing authorities established under AS 18.55.996 for the cost of on-site sewer and water facilities, road construction to project sites, energy efficient design features in homes, and extension of electrical distribution facilities to individual residences.
      </li>
      <li id="t18c55a04s18.55.998ol1b">
       A grant may be made only for residential housing for which federal loan or grant approval has been obtained from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and which will be made available to the public on a nondiscriminatory basis. A grant may not be used to retire or repay obligations or debts of the grant recipient.  A grant may only be for the difference between the maximum amount available under federal law or regulation for construction of the residential housing for which the grant is made and the actual costs of the construction. A grant may not exceed 20 percent of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development total development cost per unit in effect at the time the grant is made.

      <li id="t18c55a04s18.55.998ol1c">

       It seems clear that the Department of Community and Regional Affairs is not charged with enforcing the audit requirement of AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c55a04s18.55.996ol1i" target="_self">18.55.996(i)</a></cite>; and it is not clear who, if anyone, is so charged.
   August 2, 1982 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is quite clear that the annual audits of regional housing authorities mandated by AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c55a04s18.55.996ol1i" target="_self">18.55.996(i)</a></cite> cannot be funded by the Department of Community and Regional Affairs with housing supplemental development fund moneys; and it must be concluded that department fund should not be used for post-project cost certification.
   August 2, 1982 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Community and Regional Affairs can, under this section, condition its grants to the regional authorities on the authorities’ compliance with AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c55a04s18.55.996ol1i" target="_self">18.55.996(i)</a></cite>.
   August 2, 1982 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Community and Regional Affairs is not compelled to limit its grants to those regional housing authorities showing compliance with the auditing requirement of AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c55a04s18.55.996ol1i" target="_self">18.55.996(i)</a></cite>, though the department may in its discretion, and probably should as a matter of policy, so limit its grants.
   It follows that the department may and should refuse to make grants to authorities whose audits reveal problems.
   August 2, 1982 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Grant administrators may authorize the use of grant proceeds to reimburse a grant recipient for allowable expenses incurred before grant approval. March 24, 1986 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Expenses incurred before the enactment of an appropriation to fund the grant program may be authorized if, in the grant administrator’s discretion, expenditure approval substantially promotes the fundamental program objectives. March 24, 1986 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The limitations stated in subsections (b) and (c) on use of grant proceeds do not reflect a specific legislative intent to prohibit the use of grant funds for the reimbursement of eligible, pre-award costs. March 24, 1986 Op. Att’y Gen.

       There exists within the state a serious shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary residential housing available at low or moderate prices or rentals to persons of lower and moderate income.  There also exist within the state remote, underdeveloped, or blighted areas where the development of decent, safe, and sanitary housing is necessary to economic growth. These conditions are inimical to the safety, health, welfare, and prosperity of the residents of the state and to the sound growth of urban and rural communities.
      </li>
      <li id="t18c56a01s18.56.010ol1b">
       The legislature finds and declares that private enterprise has not been able to provide, without assistance, an adequate supply of safe and sanitary homes at prices or rents that persons of lower or moderate income can afford, or to achieve rehabilitation of much of the present housing for persons of lower and moderate income, or to provide without assistance the housing necessary to promote the economic growth of remote, underdeveloped, or blighted areas, and that existing state and federal programs are inadequate to meet housing needs of persons of lower and moderate income or of remote, underdeveloped, or blighted areas.  It is imperative that the supply of housing for persons of lower and moderate income and the housing necessary to promote the economic growth of remote, underdeveloped, or blighted areas be increased and that coordination and cooperation among private enterprise, state and local government be encouraged to sponsor, build, and rehabilitate residential housing for these persons.
      </li>
      <li id="t18c56a01s18.56.010ol1c">
       The legislature finds and declares further that, in accomplishing this purpose, the creation of the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation is essential to assist in the acquisition and development of land and the construction, rehabilitation, financing, management, maintenance, sale, and rental of dwelling units for persons of lower and moderate income or persons in remote, underdeveloped, or blighted areas and that these activities serve a public purpose in benefiting the people of the state. The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation is empowered to act on behalf of the state and its people in serving this public purpose for the benefit of the general public.
      </li>
      <li id="t18c56a01s18.56.010ol1d">
       The program of making loans for residential housing to veterans in accordance with AS 26.15 has increased and improved the supply of adequate housing in the state, and the continuation of the program is essential to the economic growth of the state and the expansion of the supply of adequate residential housing in the state. Participation by the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation in the program of purchasing and insuring state veterans’ loans as provided in this chapter will be of material aid in insuring the continuance of the program of making loans for residential housing to veterans in accordance with AS 26.15.

       Expansion of the program of the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation of purchasing insured and uninsured mortgage loans is essential to the economic growth of the state and the supply of adequate residential housing in the state.

      <li id="t18c56a01s18.56.010ol1f">
       The legislature finds that enabling the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation to assist in financing the program of veterans’ loans for residential housing in accordance with AS 26.15 and to expand its program of purchasing other mortgage loans serves a public purpose in benefiting the people of the state.  The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation is empowered to act on behalf of the state and its people in serving this public purpose for the benefit of the general public.
      </li>
      <li id="t18c56a01s18.56.010ol1g">
       The legislature finds that permitting the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation to create a subsidiary to assist in the financing of prepayment of all or a portion of a governmental employer’s share of unfunded accrued actuarial liability of retirement systems serves a public purpose in benefiting the people of the state. The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation may act on behalf of the state and its people in serving this public purpose for the benefit of the general public.

      The corporation may purchase, sell, hold, or otherwise deal in mortgage loans.
   In connection with the purchase or sale of a beneficial interest or participation in a mortgage loan, the corporation may enter into a trust agreement providing for the custody, control, and administration of the mortgage loan. The trust agreement may provide that the corporation or a bank or trust company shall act as trustor or trustee under the trust and that title to the mortgage loans subject to the trust shall be considered to have passed as provided in the trust agreement.
   To the extent provided in the trust agreement, the effect of a sale of a beneficial interest or participation in a mortgage loan is the same as the sale of the mortgage loan subject to the trust.

       For the purpose of securing any one or more issues of its obligations, the corporation may establish one or more special funds, called “capital reserve funds”, and shall pay into those capital reserve funds (1) any money appropriated and made available by the state for the purpose of any of those funds, (2) any proceeds of the sale of its obligations, to the extent provided in the resolution or resolutions of the corporation authorizing their issuance, and (3) any other money that may be made available to the corporation for the purposes of those funds from any other source.  All money held in a capital reserve fund, except as provided in this section, shall be used as required, solely for the payment of the principal of obligations or of the sinking fund payments with respect to those obligations; the purchase or redemption of obligations; the payment of interest on obligations; or the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when those obligations are redeemed before maturity. However, money in any fund may not be withdrawn from it at any time in an amount that would reduce the amount of that fund to less than the capital reserve requirement set out in (b) of this section, except for the purpose of making, with respect to those obligations, payment, when due, of principal, interest, redemption premiums and the sinking fund payments for the payment of which other money of the corporation is not available.  Any income or interest earned by, or increment to, a capital reserve fund, due to the investment of the fund or any other amounts in it, may be transferred by the corporation to other funds or accounts of the corporation to the extent that the transfer does not reduce the amount of the capital reserve fund below the capital reserve fund requirement.

       If the corporation decides to issue obligations secured by a capital reserve fund, the obligations may not be issued if the amount in the capital reserve fund is less than such a percent, not exceeding 10 percent of the principal amount of all of those obligations secured by that capital reserve fund then to be issued and then outstanding in accordance with their terms, as may be established by resolution of the corporation (called the “capital reserve fund requirement”), unless the corporation, at the time of issuance of the obligations, deposits in such capital reserve fund from the proceeds of the obligations to be issued or from other sources, an amount which, together with the amount then in the fund, will not be less than the capital reserve fund requirement.

      <li id="t18c56a01s18.56.125ol1c">
       In computing the amount of a capital reserve fund for the purpose of this section, securities in which all or a portion of the funds are invested shall be valued at par or, if purchased at less than par, at amortized costs as the term is defined by resolution of the corporation authorizing the issue of the obligations, or by some other reasonable method established by the corporation by resolution. Valuation on a particular date shall include the amount of any interest earned or accrued to that date.

       The chairman of the corporation shall annually, no later than January 2, make and deliver to the governor and chairmen of the house and senate finance committees a certificate stating the sum, if any, required to restore any capital reserve fund to the capital reserve fund requirement. The legislature may appropriate that sum, and all sums appropriated during the then current fiscal year by the legislature for the restoration shall be deposited by the corporation in the proper capital reserve fund. Nothing in this section creates a debt or liability of the state.

      Opinions of attorney general. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The legislature, in creating regional electrical authorities under this chapter, anticipated that they might supplant the function of municipal and cooperative utilities in many areas of the state.
   June 7, 1976 Op. Att’y Gen.
    </p>
    <p>
     An electrical utility owned and operated by a regional electrical authority would continue to qualify for the broad exemption from the Alaska Public Utilities Commission Act [now Alaska Public Utilities Regulatory Act], AS 42.05.010 — <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.42.html#t42c05a08s42.05.721" target="_blank">42.05.721</a></cite>, available to political subdivisions under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.42.html#t42c05a08s42.05.711ol1b" target="_blank">42.05.711(b)</a></cite> once the regional electrical authority had completed its proposed organization as a nonprofit corporation pursuant to AS 10.20.

    Finding and purpose.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature finds that an acute shortage of adequate, safe, reliable electrical facilities exists in the rural areas of the state and that adequate electrical systems cannot be provided by the private sector due to inadequate projected system revenues and economic depression in certain areas or by local governments of the state since the boundaries required for boroughs under
   art. X, § 3, of the Alaska Constitution and the boundaries of cities necessary to effectively operate as cities would, in many cases, not be adequate to provide economic, adequate, safe, and reliable electrical service. The legislature further finds that adequate housing, public facilities, and economic development are heavily dependent upon adequate, safe, and reliable electrical facilities. These conditions are inimical to the safety, health, welfare, and prosperity of the residents of the state and to the sound growth of rural communities.
   The legislature further finds that a reasonable means of accomplishing the purpose of providing adequate, safe, and reliable systems is the creation of regional electrical authorities that are not local governments.
   It is the purpose and intent of the legislature to provide a means whereby public corporations to serve as regional electrical authorities may be formed.

      The pledge of assets or revenue of the authority to the payment of the principal or interest of obligations of the authority is valid and binding from the time the pledge is made and assets or revenue pledged are immediately subject to the lien of the pledge without physical delivery or further action. The lien of a pledge is valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether those parties have notice of the lien of the pledge.
   Nothing prohibits the authority from selling assets subject to a pledge, except that a sale may be restricted by the trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of the obligations.

     This article applies equally to agencies of state government and to private sector employers.
   March 27, 1980 Op. Att’y Gen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Alaska Department of Labor [now Department of Labor and Workforce Development] has sufficient authority under Alaska law to administer and enforce safety and health regulations as to employment conditions on state-operated vessels which are not separately regulated by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the United States Coast Guard or any other federal agency. February 16, 1982 Op. Att’y Gen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The state’s strong interest in providing occupational safety and health coverage for all of its employees, combined with the primarily local operation of most state ferries and vessels, provides a substantial basis for applying state laws to employment conditions on State of Alaska vessels. February 16, 1982 Op. Att’y Gen.
    </p>
    <p>
     With respect to state employees working on vessels which are too small to qualify for the Coast Guard’s certification requirements, or which are otherwise exempted from Coast Guard inspections, the Department of Labor [now Department of Labor and Workforce Development] retains jurisdiction to enforce any applicable existing safety and health standards, as may be supplemented by eventual maritime standards. February 16, 1982 Op. Att’y Gen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Department of Labor [now Department of Labor and Workforce Development] cannot cite a partnership for a violation of the Occupational Safety and Health Act where the only exposed workers are partners of the partnership; where the facts indicate a bona fide partnership and the only exposed workers are partners who share equally in the control and operation of the partnership, there are no exposed employees under this article and the partnership is not in violation.

       Paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a), authorizing the right of entry and inspection, substantially parallel the federal counterpart, 29 U.S.C. § 657(a). Woods &amp; Rohde, Inc. v. State, Dep't of Labor, 565 P.2d 138 (Alaska 1977).

        Warrantless inspection is unconstitutional. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A warrantless Occupational Safety and Health Act inspection, as authorized by subsection (a), constitutes an unconstitutional search in that it is violative of Alaska Const., art. I,
   § 14. Woods &amp; Rohde, Inc. v. State, Dep't of Labor, 565 P.2d 138 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       In light of the expansive protections afforded to citizens of Alaska by virtue of Alaska Const., art. I, §§ 14 and 22 against warrantless searches and seizures and invasions of privacy, the Alaska Constitution prohibits warrantless administrative inspections of private business premises. Woods &amp; Rohde, Inc. v. State, Dep't of Labor, 565 P.2d 138 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since violations of Alaska’s Occupational Safety and Health Act can result in significant fines and imprisonment, the self-protection and private interests of the owner of business premises are deserving of, although not equivalent to, the significant constitutional solicitude and protection afforded Alaska’s citizens in criminal prosecutions, for broad statutory safeguards are inadequate substitutes for individualized judicial review of applications for search warrants. Woods &amp; Rohde, Inc. v. State, Dep't of Labor, 565 P.2d 138 (Alaska 1977).

       Authority to inspect and search one’s business premises should be evidenced by a warrant, and the burden of obtaining a warrant is not likely to frustrate the purpose of Occupational Safety and Health Act inspections.

      The Department of Labor and Workforce Development may suspend an inspection certificate when, in its opinion, the boiler or unfired pressure vessel for which it was issued cannot be operated without menace to the public safety, or when the boiler or unfired pressure vessel does not comply with the regulations.
   A special inspector has this same power to suspend an inspection certificate for an insured boiler or unfired pressure vessel or an unfired pressure vessel operated by the company employing the special inspector.
   Suspension of an inspection certificate continues in effect until reinstatement. A certificate may not be reinstated until the boiler or unfired pressure vessel conforms to the rules and regulations of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development.

       The provisions of the National Electrical Safety Code requiring that supply conductors carrying 7,200 volts of electricity have minimum vertical clearance of eight feet from buildings is not directed solely at those electrical utilities that install high-voltage lines. Ferriss v. Texaco, 599 P.2d 161 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is just as unsafe for one to construct a building with less than an eight-foot vertical clearance from the high-voltage conductors previously installed, as it is to place a 7,200-volt supply conductor within the same vertical distance from existing buildings. Ferriss v. Texaco, 599 P.2d 161 (Alaska 1979).

     <p>
      Upon application to the department, a person, corporation, electric utility firm, public utility district, rural electrification association, or municipal utility district furnishing electrical current may be authorized by the commissioner to inspect the electrical wiring for a public or commercial structure as defined in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c60a06s18.60.660" target="_self">18.60.660</a></cite> to which it is to furnish electrical current before energizing the electrical system on, in, or about the premises. Authorization by the commissioner under this section constitutes a grant of full authority to act within the provisions of AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c60a06s18.60.580" target="_self">18.60.580</a></cite>

   A person or entity whose electrical wiring installation is found by the authorized inspector not to meet the standards prescribed has the right to appeal to the commissioner for a new inspection. The commissioner shall, within 15 days, furnish a new inspection by a designee not associated with the person, firm, or utility that did the original inspection.

      The department is responsible for the administration of the code.
   The department may adopt regulations designed for maximum practical implementation of the code, and may grant exceptions from specific code provisions, where distance or other factors make implementation impractical.
   Specific consideration shall be given to outlying villages and sparsely populated areas to ensure that AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c60a08s18.60.705" target="_self">18.60.705</a></cite> — <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c60a08s18.60.740" target="_self">18.60.740</a></cite> will not impose an undue financial burden. The department may by regulation designate appropriate inspection to a public or private utility company. A company so designated may refuse utility connections if an installation does not meet the requirements of this code.

       State troopers did not owe reckless driving victim a duty to arrest the driver on an existing warrant; statutory immunity applied, and no special relationship existed to otherwise impose a duty to protect against a third party. Wongittilin v. State, 36 P.3d 678 (Alaska 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section provides that state troopers may execute any lawful warrant or order of arrest. The word “may” in a statute affords the police officer permissive authority, not an obligatory duty. Therefor, this section does not create a duty to arrest on an outstanding warrant. Wongittilin v. State, 36 P.3d 678 (Alaska 2001).

       AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c65a01s18.65.090" target="_self">18.65.090</a></cite> does not conflict with this section. The purpose of AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c65a01s18.65.090" target="_self">18.65.090</a></cite> is to require cooperation between governmental departments to enforce the law. AS 18.65.090 imposes a duty on the police to assist other governmental departments but not a general duty to protect the public. Thus, neither statute establishes a police duty to execute outstanding warrants. Wongittilin v. State, 36 P.3d 678 (Alaska 2001).

      <p>
       For discussion of whether the sanction of the Registration Act,
   ch. 41, SLA 1994, entails an affirmative disability or restraint, whether the sanction has historically been regarded as punitive, whether the sanction depends upon a finding of scienter, whether the sanction will operate to promote traditional punishment objectives, whether the sanction applies to behavior which is already a crime, whether there is an alternative non-punitive purpose for the sanction, and whether the sanction is excessive in relation to the alternative purpose, see
   Rowe v. Burton, 884 F. Supp. 1372 (D. Alaska 1994), rev'd, 248 F.3d 832 (9th Cir. Alaska 2001), reversed on other grounds, sub nom.
   Doe v. Otte, 248 F.3d 832 (9th Cir. Alaska), amended,
   (9th Cir. 2001), amended, 259 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Registration Act,
   ch. 41, SLA 1994, is likely to violate the prohibition on ex post facto legislation, because the law includes a provision providing for public dissemination of information concerning sex offenders whose convictions antedate the Registration Act.
   Rowe v. Burton, 884 F. Supp. 1372 (D. Alaska 1994), rev'd, 248 F.3d 832 (9th Cir. Alaska 2001), reversed on other grounds, sub nom.
   Doe v. Otte, 248 F.3d 832 (9th Cir. Alaska), amended,
   (9th Cir. 2001), amended, 259 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the Registration Act,
   ch. 41, SLA 1994, is likely penal in nature because of the provision for public dissemination of information, plaintiffs, who pled no contest to sex offenses pursuant to plea bargains that did not include any duty to register, are likely to prevail on claims for violation of the plea agreements and due process.
   Rowe v. Burton, 884 F. Supp. 1372 (D. Alaska 1994), rev'd, 248 F.3d 832 (9th Cir. Alaska 2001), reversed on other grounds, sub nom.
   Doe v. Otte, 248 F.3d 832 (9th Cir. Alaska), amended,
   (9th Cir. 2001), amended, 259 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sex offenders required to register with police authorities were not likely to prevail on their assertion that the Registration Act,
   ch. 41, SLA 1994, and specifically the requirement to submit oneself to the state troopers or local police for photographs and fingerprinting, was an unreasonable search or seizure.
   Rowe v. Burton, 884 F. Supp. 1372 (D. Alaska 1994), rev'd, 248 F.3d 832 (9th Cir. Alaska 2001), reversed on other grounds, sub nom.
   Doe v. Otte, 248 F.3d 832 (9th Cir. Alaska), amended,
   (9th Cir. 2001), amended, 259 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sex offenders required to register with police authorities do not appear to be able to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information required to be disclosed by the Registration Act,
   ch. 41, SLA 1994.
   Rowe v. Burton, 884 F. Supp. 1372 (D. Alaska 1994), rev'd, 248 F.3d 832 (9th Cir. Alaska 2001), reversed on other grounds, sub nom.
   Doe v. Otte, 248 F.3d 832 (9th Cir. Alaska), amended,
   (9th Cir. 2001), amended, 259 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a defendant offered no authority that society would recognize as reasonable his subjective expectation of privacy in his physical appearance, as represented by his photograph, or that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his employer’s address, and where the individuals whose privacy interests were being affected by the sex offender registration statute were members of an identifiable group that the legislature considered a sufficient public safety risk to justify the creation of the registry and the release of certain biographical data, the defendant’s expectation of privacy was not an expectation that society would recognize as reasonable. Patterson v. State, 985 P.2d 1007 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999), overruled in part, Doe v. Dep't of Public Safety, 92 P.3d 398 (Alaska 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act (Act), 1994 Alaska Sess. Laws 41, is non-punitive and thus its retroactive application does not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws set out in
   U.S. Const. art. I, § 10, cl. 1; the Act is clearly intended as a civil, non-punitive means of identifying previous offenders for the protection of the public, and any adverse effects to registrants do not constitute a significant affirmative disability or restraint to render the Act effectively punitive.
   Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 123 S. Ct. 1140, 155 L. Ed. 2d 164 (U.S. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act’s registration and dissemination provisions under this section have consequences to sex offenders that go beyond the state’s interest in public safety; therefore, the Alaska statute is excessive in relation to the state’s interest in public safety for ex post facto purposes. Doe v. State, 189 P.3d 999 (Alaska 2008), reaff'd, 297 P.3d 885 (Alaska 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because dissemination provision of Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act (ASORA), as set forth in this section, resembles the punishment of shaming and the registration and disclosure provisions are comparable to conditions of supervised release or parole, these provisions have effects like those resulting from punishment; the fact that ASORA’s registration reporting provisions are comparable to supervised release or parole supports a conclusion that ASORA is punitive for ex post facto purposes. Doe v. State, 189 P.3d 999 (Alaska 2008), reaff'd, 297 P.3d 885 (Alaska 2013).

     <p>
      The administration of criminal justice affects the health, safety, and welfare of the people of this state and requires education and training of a professional quality. It is a primary public interest that applicants meet minimum standards for employment as police officers, probation and parole officers, and correctional officers, and that criminal justice education and training be made available to police officers, probation and parole officers, and correctional officers serving in a probationary capacity and police officers, probation and parole officers, and correctional officers already in regular service. It is of secondary public interest to encourage the establishment of preliminary training programs for persons seeking to become police officers, probation and parole officers, and correctional officers. Application of standards for employment and making education and training available for municipal correctional officers is also in the public interest.

     <p>
      The Alaska police training fund is created in the general fund. The fund consists of appropriations made by the legislature to the fund. The legislature may appropriate to the fund the annual estimated balance in the accounts maintained under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.37.html#t37c05a02s37.05.142" target="_blank">37.05.142</a></cite> for money collected under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.12.html#t12c25a02s12.25.195ol1c" target="_blank">12.25.195(c)</a></cite>, AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.12.html#t12c55s12.55.039" target="_blank">12.55.039</a></cite>, AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.28.html#t28c05a04s28.05.151" target="_blank">28.05.151</a></cite>, and AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.29.html#t29c25s29.25.074" target="_blank">29.25.074</a></cite>. The legislature may make appropriations from the fund to (1) the Department of Public Safety for the Public Safety Training Academy, including Village Public Safety Officers, (2) the Alaska Police Standards Council to provide training for the law enforcement and corrections community of the state under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c65a02s18.65.230" target="_self">18.65.230</a></cite>, and (3) municipalities that conduct their own police training programs. Nothing in this section creates a dedicated fund.

       State of Alaska does not violate the equal protection rights of residents of “off-road” Native communities through its allocation of law enforcement services. While off-road communities receive fewer certified police officers, they are not situated similarly to the on-road communities; trooper allocation statutes and regulations are facially race-neutral and there is no intent to discriminate.

       On judicial review of the Alaska Police Standards Council’s decision that a police officer was not of good moral character, the substitution of judgment standard did not apply because this policy decision involving agency expertise was reviewed for a rational basis.

        Good moral character. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska Police Standards Council (Council) reasonably decided a police officer was not of good moral character because (1) the officer admitted lying and being evasive in an investigation, (2) the lack of a legal requirement to terminate a police officer’s employment for minor acts of dishonesty did not limit the Council’s discretion to revoke an officer’s certification, (3) stipulated facts showing the officer’s harassing conduct supported the conclusion that the officer did not have the moral character required of a police officer in Alaska, and (4) nothing showed improper facts were considered or relevant facts were not considered. Alaska Police Stds. Council v. Parcell, 348 P.3d 882 (Alaska 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska Police Standards Council had a reasonable basis to revoke appellant's police certificate based on a lack of good moral character because appellant made dishonest statements in his request for a welfare check, in his police report on his interview with a complainant, and during the subsequent investigations, creating a reasonable basis for the determination that he lacked honesty, as well as fairness, respect for the rights of others, and the law. Much v. Alaska Police Stds. Council, — P.3d — (Alaska Apr. 11, 2018) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence did not support Alaska Police Standards Council's (Council) findings in revoking a police officer's certificate for lack of sufficient moral character due to testimony the officer would again apply for an Alaska Permanent Fund dividend despite being found ineligible based on the officer's interpretation of remarks of a judge who acquitted him in a related criminal prosecution, because (1) the Council did not find the officer willfully misinterpreted the judge's remarks, only that a reasonable person with police training should have better understood the law governing the officer's conduct, (2) such a finding did not find the officer in fact understood the law, (3) it was not the same as dishonesty or disrespect for the law, and (4) the evidence disproportionately supported finding the officer did not understand the law when testifying.

       “(a) Notwithstanding AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c65a02s18.65.248" target="_self">18.65.248</a></cite>, added by sec. 6 of this Act, a person employed by the state as a correctional, probation, or parole officer on February 9, 1991 may continue to be employed as an officer without a certificate issued by the Alaska Police Standards Council.
   The Department of Corrections may not discriminate against a person employed as a correctional, probation, or parole officer under this subsection in any matter relating to the officer’s employment status, wages and benefits payable, promotion and reassignment opportunities, or training necessary to attain certification because the officer does not have a certificate issued by the Alaska Police Standards Council.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) A person continuing in employment under the exemption provided in (a) of this section who terminates that employment after February 9, 1991 may be reemployed by the state as a correctional, probation, or parole officer only if the person holds a valid certificate issued by the Alaska Police Standards Council.”

       To be a police officer within the meaning of this statute, an officer must be currently working full time for a police department, that is, an organized civil force whose basic purpose and function is to maintain peace and order and to prevent and investigate criminal offenses. September 18, 1977 Op. Att'y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       As applied to the coverage of AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c65a02s18.65.130" target="_self">18.65.130</a></cite> — <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c65a02s18.65.290" target="_self">18.65.290</a></cite>, the term “police officer” is more restrictively defined than the definition in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.01.html#t01c10a02s01.10.060" target="_blank">01.10.060</a></cite> to include all those full-time employees of police departments administered by the state or one of its political subdivisions who have full police duties and the authority to enforce all of the laws of the State of Alaska which carry a penalty for their violation. September 18, 1977 Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comparing the classification of “peace officer” in
   AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.01.html#t01c10a02s01.10.060" target="_blank">01.10.060</a></cite> with that of “police officer,” it is apparent that police officers, as defined in paragraph (3) [now (8)], are always peace officers since they have full police duties that are exercised on a full-time basis. However, the converse of this proposition can never be the case; that is, peace officer status does not automatically vest one with the status of a police officer since peace officers are not necessarily employees of a police department and do not necessarily have the power to enforce all the penal, traffic or highway laws of the state. September 18, 1977 Op. Att'y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most Village Public Safety Officers and Village Police Officers are not “police officers” under the definition in paragraph (3) [now (8)]. Whether an individual officer is subject to regulation by the Alaska Police Standards Council depends upon the circumstances of his or her employment and has to be determined on a case-by-case basis. July 1, 1984 Op. Att'y Gen.

      </p>
      <p>
       State of Alaska does not violate the equal protection rights of residents of “off-road” Native communities through its allocation of law enforcement services. While off-road communities receive fewer certified police officers, they are not situated similarly to the on-road communities; trooper allocation statutes and regulations are facially race-neutral and there is no intent to discriminate.

      </p>
      <p>
       Establishment of the Village Public Safety Officers program is based on the advice of knowledgeable people in the field of law enforcement and is not an effort by the State of Alaska to resurrect an old model of providing law enforcement services to Alaska Natives that was in place from the late 1800s to early 1900.

       A person who reasonably believes that the person is a victim of stalking or sexual assault that is not a crime involving domestic violence may file a petition under AS 18.65.850 and request an ex parte protective order. If the court finds that the petition establishes probable cause that the crime of stalking or sexual assault has occurred, that it is necessary to protect the petitioner from further stalking or sexual assault, and that the petitioner has certified to the court in writing the efforts, if any, that have been made to provide notice to the respondent, the court shall ex parte and without notice to the respondent issue a protective order. An ex parte protective order under this section may grant the protection allowed by AS 18.65.850(c). An ex parte protective order expires 20 days after it is issued unless dissolved earlier by the court at the request of either the petitioner or the respondent after notice and, if requested, a hearing. If the court issues an ex parte protective order, the court shall have the order delivered to the appropriate law enforcement agency for expedited service.

The request may be made orally or in writing based on the sworn statement of a peace officer, and in person or by telephone. If the court finds probable cause to believe that the petitioner is in immediate danger of stalking or sexual assault based on an allegation of the recent commission of stalking or sexual assault, the court ex parte shall issue an emergency protective order. An emergency protective order may grant the protection allowed by AS 18.65.850(c). An emergency protective order expires 72 hours after it is issued unless dissolved earlier by the court at the request of the petitioner.

The court shall schedule a hearing and provide at least 10 days’ notice to the respondent of the hearing and of the respondent’s right to appear and be heard, either in person or through an attorney. If the court finds that an extension of the provisions of the order is necessary to protect the petitioner from domestic violence, regardless of whether the respondent appears at the hearing, the court may extend the provisions of the order. An extension granted under this subsection is effective for one year unless earlier dissolved by court order.

      <p>
       Wife was properly granted a long-term protective order in a divorce action because the husband did not dispute destroying her cell phone, sending her a text message implying a murder-suicide, or following her; photographs in the record showing the wife’s bruises supported the finding that the husband assaulted her.

      <p>
       Superior court did not abuse its discretion in granting a long-term domestic violence protective order because an 11-year-old child sustained injuries—including bruising on his chin and cheek and an abrasion on his lip—in an incident that occurred in the father’s kitchen. There was no indication that the judge clearly erred by finding that the child was shoved, or in determining that the conduct was unreasonable as a form of discipline.

      </p>
      <p>
       Grant of a long-term domestic violence protective order to a father was appropriate because the mother committed custodial interference, a crime of domestic violence, when the mother, who claimed concerns about the child's safety, refused to return the parties' daughter to the father's care at the end of regular weekend visitation as required by a custody order and refused to tell the father where the child was for two days thereafter. The necessity defense was not applicable to the mother's conduct.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court vacated the trial court's domestic violence protective order entered against the father because the trial court erred by admitting the mother's recording of the child's statement concerning an assault without making threshold findings as to the child's competency, given his autism and other mental health issues and the recording's trustworthiness. The trial court also erred by finding that the father's committed trespass because the record contained no trespass order. Stephan P. v. Cecilia A., 464 P.3d 266 (Alaska 2020).

       Inclusion within paragraph (c)(2) of the phrase “or otherwise communicating” immediately after “contacting” strongly suggests that nonphysical contact must involve some element of direct or indirect communication and does not merely mean coming within view; further, “nonconsensual contact” in the stalking statute is not all that is needed for a crime to take place; the contact must also be “repeated,” so that it is a course of conduct, and it must place the protected person in fear, and the need for these additional requirements to make stalking a crime argues against a construction that makes merely appearing in the sight of a protected person, without more, a crime.

       Superior court properly denied an ex-wife's petition for extension of a domestic violence protective order under against her ex-husband because res judicata prevented her from obtaining another protective order based on the same conduct that gave rise to the first protective order where she did not alleged a new statutory invasion or injury in the form of a new domestic violence incident, but rather that she still feared him based on the domestic violence that formed the basis of her earlier domestic violence protective order.

       Where husband admitted to having been at a mall at a time when his wife, who had sought a protective order against the husband, was also there, but he denied having seen his wife, being in the mere presence of his wife did not mean “contacting” his wife; the meaning of “contacting” had a normal meaning, and a nonphysical “contact” did not mean merely coming within view.

       Service of process on an ex-wife in a forcible entry and detainer action did not constitute a violation of a 2009 domestic violence protective order, given the factual finding that the ex-husband’s filing of the action was not intended to either intimidate or harass the ex-wife.

       Superior court correctly ruled that a mother’s motion to modify custody was not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel because the parties repeatedly and expressly declined to litigate issues of domestic violence or custody at the long-term domestic violence hearing, and the mother was not attempting to relitigate issues that had already been decided; neither domestic violence nor custody was actually litigated and necessarily decided in the protective order proceeding.

      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not abuse its discretion following a domestic violence hearing by restricting a mother to supervised visitation because the mother had notice of the domestic violence hearing, attended the hearing with counsel, and had the opportunity to testify and present other evidence if sher wished. The court acted well within its statutory authority when, as a result of the findings of custodial interference by the mother made at the hearing, the court modified custody and imposed conditions on her visitation.

       A person who is a victim of a crime involving domestic violence may file a petition under AS 18.66.100(a) and request an ex parte protective order. If the court finds that the petition establishes probable cause that a crime involving domestic violence has occurred, it is necessary to protect the petitioner from domestic violence, and if the petitioner has certified to the court in writing the efforts, if any, that have been made to provide notice to the respondent, the court shall ex parte and without notice to the respondent issue a protective order. An ex parte protective order may grant the protection provided by AS 18.66.100(c)(1) — (5), (8) — (12), and (16). An ex parte protective order expires 20 days after it is issued unless dissolved earlier by the court at the request of either the petitioner or the respondent and after notice and, if requested, a hearing. If a court issues an ex parte protective order, the court shall have the order delivered to the appropriate local law enforcement agency for expedited service and for entry into the central registry of protective orders under AS 18.65.540.

The request may be made orally or in writing based upon the sworn statement of a peace officer, and in person or by telephone. If the court finds probable cause to believe that the victim is in immediate danger of domestic violence based on an allegation of the recent commission of a crime involving domestic violence, the court ex parte shall issue an emergency protective order. In an emergency protective order, the court may grant the protection provided by AS 18.66.100(c)(1) — (5), (8), (10), (11), and (16). An emergency protective order expires 72 hours after it is issued unless dissolved earlier by the court at the request of the petitioner.

A municipality may establish a domestic violence fatality review team in a municipality. When the investigation of fatal incidents of domestic violence and incidents of domestic violence involving serious physical injury has been completed or adjudicated by law enforcement or at an earlier appropriate time, a domestic violence fatality review team may review those incidents for the purpose of preventing domestic-violence-related fatalities, improving the response of law enforcement and other agencies to domestic violence, and providing consultation and coordination for agencies involved in the prevention and investigation of domestic violence. The review may include a review of events leading up to the domestic violence incident, available community resources, current laws and policies, actions taken by agencies and persons related to the incident and persons involved in the incident, and other information the team determines to be relevant to the review. The confidential and other records of a department or agency of the state or a municipality relating to the domestic violence incident may be examined by the domestic violence fatality review team or a member of the team.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where a domestic violence restraining order was issued, based in part on a finding that the defendant and victim were related within the fourth degree of consanguinity, the judge properly vacated the order upon the defendant proving that the relationship was within the fifth degree, not the statutorily prescribed fourth. Jacko v. State, 981 P.2d 1075 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).

      </p>
      <p>
       When an ex-husband broke the windows in his former mother-in-law’s car, this was a crime involving domestic violence because his former mother-in-law had been related to him by marriage. McComas v. Kirn, 105 P.3d 1130 (Alaska 2005).

        Terms broadly defined. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sentencing judge may require the defendant to attend a batterer’s intervention program, but the definitions of “crime involving domestic violence” and “domestic violence” are quite broad under this section and AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.12.html#t12c55s12.55.185" target="_blank">12.55.185</a></cite>(4), encompassing many situations that have nothing to do with an assault by one domestic partner against another, making a different intervention program more appropriate. Cooper v. Dist. Court, 133 P.3d 692 (Alaska Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was sufficient evidence that defendant and the victim had dated to satisfy the definition of “household member” where the victim testified that she met defendant in 2004 or 2005 and that they dated “on and off” for three or four years.
   O'Donnell v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. June 29, 2011) (memorandum decision).

        “Dating.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Use of the term “dating” in the definition of a household member in the statute does not result in a definition that is so conflicting or confused that it cannot be given meaning in the adjudication process.
   O'Donnell v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. June 29, 2011) (memorandum decision).
      </p>

        “Domestic violence.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the real source of potential prejudice was not the ultimate validity or invalidity of a restraining order, but the fact that the order was termed a “domestic violence” restraining order, where the judge gave a curative instruction to the jury, none of the testimony at the trial suggested that the defendant had engaged in physical violence, and there were few references to domestic violence in the course of the trial, the judge did not abuse his discretion when he precluded the defendant from presenting evidence that the restraining order was invalidated subsequent to the violation forming the basis for the charge. Jacko v. State, 981 P.2d 1075 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature consistently uses the phrase “crimes involving domestic violence” in a context which indicates that the reference is to a criminal act, not a criminal conviction. State v. Bingaman, 991 P.2d 227 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of “other crimes involving domestic violence by the defendant” does not require proof of a conviction to be admissible. State v. Bingaman, 991 P.2d 227 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly admitted evidence of a prior incident of domestic violence where it tended to show the husband’s propensity to act violently toward the wife when provoked. The court had no duty to state the specific character trait of the husband which the prior incident was admitted to illustrate. Bennett v. Municipality of Anchorage, 205 P.3d 1113 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       The terms “dating” and “sexual relationship” are not irremediably ambiguous; while reasonable people might disagree in particular cases about whether a couple’s series of social engagements constituted dating or whether their relationship was a sexual one, the fact that there may be individual cases that are difficult to classify does not mean that the terms “dating” and “sexual relationship” have no objectively ascertainable meaning.
   Lampley v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Apr. 1, 2009) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Domestic violence protective order was properly granted where sufficient evidence showed that a man attempted to commit the crime of coercion to get his former girlfriend to return to him because he had threatened to provide evidence to her ex-husband’s lawyers regarding a custody dispute, to report her parents’ alleged marijuana operation to the police, and to report her to the Alaska Office of Children’s Services (OCS) for sexually abusing her children. McGraw v. Cox, 285 P.3d 276 (Alaska 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the State’s burden to prove the offense was a crime of domestic violence, and it was the superior court’s obligation to make an express ruling on the State’s allegation; the superior court failed to make the required ruling, and the omission was not clearly harmless, because the record did not clearly establish the truth of the State’s assertion. Miller v. State, 312 P.3d 1112 (Alaska Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s failure to object to the domestic violence designation in the superior court did not mean that he forfeited any objection on appeal, but it did mean that he had to show plain error. Miller v. State, 312 P.3d 1112 (Alaska Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother was properly awarded child custody because, inter alia, the father’s actions, including statutory rape of the mother, violation of a domestic violence protection order, and striking another child, triggered the presumption in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.25.html#t25c24a01s25.24.150ol1g" target="_blank">25.24.150(g)</a></cite> against awarding the father custody. Thomas G. v. Sonya G., — P.3d — (Alaska June 24, 2015), cert. denied, 577 U.S. 1079, 136 S. Ct. 834, 193 L. Ed. 2d 741 (U.S. 2016) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in failing to obtain defendant's personal waiver of the right to jury trial where defendant was charged with assault on his girlfriend, a crime of domestic violence, because he did not object to his attorney's waiver of a jury trial.
   Ivon v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Sept. 27, 2017) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly denied an ex-wife's petition for extension of a domestic violence protective order under against her ex-husband because res judicata prevented her from obtaining another protective order based on the same conduct that gave rise to the first protective order where she did not alleged a new statutory invasion or injury in the form of a new domestic violence incident, but rather that she still feared him based on the domestic violence that formed the basis of her earlier domestic violence protective order. Whalen v. Whalen, 425 P.3d 150 (Alaska 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not an abuse of discretion to find a mother showed no substantial change in circumstances when moving for a custody modification because (1) the court did not previously find such a change, and (2) it was not clear error to find no domestic violence occurred.
   Andrea C. v. Marcus K., — P.3d — (Alaska Nov. 28, 2018) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because defendant's prior offense (sexual abuse of a minor) and the charged offenses (second-degree sexual assault and incest) both involved defendant's biological daughters, and because they were qualifying offenses, they constituted crimes involving domestic violence. Therefore, evidence of defendant's prior conduct involving the victim's sister was admissible into evidence. Kasgnoc v. State, 448 P.3d 883 (Alaska Ct. App. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Husband's petition for a short-term protective order was properly denied because, while the superior court acknowledged that it heard a lot of evidence about discord and the deterioration of the parties' relationship, the husband had failed to provide sufficient proof that he had been the victim of domestic violence.
   Jason B. v. Heather B., — P.3d — (Alaska June 3, 2020) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a father alleged that a mother committed multiple acts of custodial interference, he should have been allowed the opportunity to prove his allegations of domestic violence at a hearing on his motion to modify custody and visitation. Daniel H. v. Amber G., — P.3d — (Alaska June 10, 2020).

       <b>
        Stalking of ex-wife constitutes domestic violence. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       When an ex-husband sent threatening communications to his ex-wife, this was stalking; these acts by the ex-husband were sufficient support for the issuance of a protective order because stalking in the second degree is a crime involving domestic violence when committed against a former spouse. McComas v. Kirn, 105 P.3d 1130 (Alaska 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Preservation for review. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to preserve an argument that a self-defense instruction did not encompass his theory of the case because defendant failed to object on that ground, as required by Alaska R. Crim. P. 30(a). Leu v. State, 251 P.3d 363 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011).

       <b>
        Verbal confrontation held possible assault. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Verbal confrontation in a parking lot between persons reported as being a “couple” in a 911 call constituted a potential crime which was properly investigated by a police officer, who stopped a car occupied by the couple to determine if there had been an incident of domestic violence. State v. Miller, 207 P.3d 541 (Alaska 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Water-throwing does not constitute act of domestic violence. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in finding a water-throwing incident between a husband and a wife did not constitute an act of domestic violence because the wife admitted that the husband had not inflicted serious bodily injury. Parks v. Parks, 214 P.3d 295 (Alaska 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Household member.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subparagraph (5)(E), the term “household member” is so broad that it could include one’s first cousins and great-aunts and uncles, no matter where they reside; and under subparagraphs (5)(C) and (5)(H), in combination, “household member” also could include the children of a high school or college sweetheart that one has not seen or thought of in 30 years.
   Carpentino v. State, 42 P.3d 1137 (Alaska Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       During defendant’s trial for attempted murder of his girlfriend, the court did not err in admitting evidence of a prior assault that he committed against the girlfriend; defendant and the girlfriend were “household members,” and his assault on her qualified as a “crime involving domestic violence” for purposes of Alaska R. Evid. 404(b)(4). Bates v. State, 258 P.3d 851 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no constitutional vagueness error in finding that an assault victim was a “household member,” even though the sexual relationship was casual. An ongoing friendship between two men that, up until five months before the assault, included occasional sexual intimacy, was not the type of non-consensual or short-lived sexual involvement that fell outside the ordinary person’s understanding of a “sexual relationship.” Leu v. State, 251 P.3d 363 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of two prior assaults defendant had committed was admissible where his statement to an officer that he had lived with the victim since his release from a halfway house supported the finding that the two were living together for purposes of paragraphs (3)(A) and (5)(B) of this section. At the time of the assault the victim and defendant shared an intent to live together indefinitely as house mates, and the victims of the prior assault had been members of defendant's household.
   Burrell v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Feb. 8, 2017) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by rejecting defendant's wife's spousal immunity privilege not to testify against defendant at his trial for sexual abuse of a minor because the victim was a “household member” under an exception to the privilege, as her grand jury testimony made clear that she was engaged in a sexual or dating relationship with defendant which spanned many months and involved multiple intimate encounters, not all of which were sexual nature.
   Anderson v. State, 436 P.3d 1071 (Alaska Ct. App. 2018).

        Insufficient findings for appellate review. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Long-term protective order against the husband was vacated as the superior court's conclusory findings regarding the wife's petition for a protective order were insufficient to enable meaningful appellate review because neither its written order nor its oral findings provided any indication of the evidence on which they were based.

      A city, other incorporated entity, and other fire protection groups may organize a mutual-aid program by adopting an ordinance or resolution authorizing and permitting their fire department, fire company, emergency relief squad, fire police squad, or fire patrol to go to the aid of another city, incorporated entity, or fire protection group, or territory outside of it.

      It is the policy of the state to protect its residents and their property from the ravages of fire. The state recognizes the need for the state to participate in providing an educational and training system that meets the needs of all communities and all fire services personnel. The legislature finds that fire is a constant threat and that homes, places of employment, modes of transportation, and our natural resources need a system of fire protection that is based on the most current, practical standards and educational principles.

     While the Alaska supreme court has stated that antidiscrimination legislation enacted in Alaska is not substantially similar to comparable federal laws, the overall conceptual approach of the federal scheme is similar to Alaska’s. May 14, 1979 Op. Att’y Gen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Alaska State Commission for Human Rights executive director has the initial responsibility for deciding jurisdictional questions; the law is silent on the authority of the commissioners to make such a decision in the absence of investigation and conciliation efforts relevant to the complaint.
   January 4, 1980 Op. Att’y Gen.

    <p>
     Alaska Const., art. I, § 3, as implemented by this chapter probably prohibits the state from enacting any laws or adopting any regulations giving special hunting privileges to a class of citizens consisting of Eskimos, Aleuts and Indians only.
   January 21, 1981 Op. Att’y Gen.

    <p>
     There is justification for the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities to require specifically, in wholly state funded contracts, that a prime contractor make substantial and good faith efforts to meet a goal of awarding a given percentage of the dollar value of the contract to minority business enterprise subcontractors.

   The court has the power to grant the temporary relief or restraining order it considers just and proper; however, no relief or order extending beyond 10 days may be granted except by consent of the respondent or after hearing upon notice to the respondent and a finding by the court that there is reasonable cause to believe that the respondent has engaged in discriminatory practices.

       The legislature intended the commission to be more than a simple complaint-taking bureau; the statutory scheme constitutes a mandate to the agency to seek out and eradicate discrimination in employment, in credit and financing practices, in places of public accommodations, and in the sale, lease or rental of real property.

Yellow Cab, 611 P.2d 487 (Alaska 1980), a prima facie case of national origin and religion-based discrimination, where substantial evidence did not support the hearing examiner’s findings that the school district’s reasons for not hiring the teacher were not pretextual.

       Employee’s claim for back pay was not barred because he did not have the opportunity to assert the claim before the Human Rights Commission; employee did not control his claim for back pay and therefore did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate it, and res judicata did not preclude him from pursuing the claim in superior court.

      <p>
       In a discrimination case, it was an error of law for the staff or executive director of the commission to resolve at the investigative stage the legitimacy of the employer’s nondiscriminatory reasons and the complainant’s success in rebutting those reasons. By offering objective evidence of facts which established a prima facie case of discrimination and which raised a genuine dispute about the employer’s explanation of its decisions, the complainant established substantial evidence of discrimination sufficient to warrant a hearing.

       The natural sequence of this section, entitled “Order,” following AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c80a02s18.80.120" target="_self">18.80.120</a></cite>, entitled “Hearing,” and the use of the word “order” in each of the subsections of this section, indicate quite clearly that all of the “orders” referred to in this section are those issued by the commission at the completion of the hearing, and not at the completion of some action by the executive director in the absence of a commission hearing. Hotel &amp; Rest. Union Local 878 v. Alaska State Comm'n for Human Rights, 595 P.2d 653 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although subsection (a) of this section is prefaced by the words “at the completion of the hearing,” whereas the other subsections are not, that is of little significance.
   The words “at the completion of the hearing” can be logically construed as modifying each of the following subsections after subsection (a) of this section.
   It would amount to an unnecessary repetition of words to preface each subsection by “at the completion of the hearing,” for it is obvious that the subsections following subsection (a) of this section are written in such a way that the issuance of the various orders referred to in each subsection would logically follow the conclusion of a commission hearing.

       Employer was not entitled to attorney’s fees as the prevailing party under 42 U.S.C.S. § 2000e-5(k) because the statute governed only the jurisdiction of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,and the enforcement action at issue was brought by the Alaska State Commission for Human Rights, and fee awards in such actions were governed by state statute.

      <p>
       There was a reasonable basis for the conclusion of the Alaska State Commission for Human Rights that the statute did not require an award of attorney’s fees to an employer because the Commission had broad discretion to order the payment of attorney’s fees, and there was no finding that an employee acted improperly in filing her discrimination complaint; the statute does not prohibit the Commission from exercising its discretion by adopting rules that limit fee awards to certain types of cases.

        “Aggrieved.” —

      </p>
      <p>
       The “aggrieved” standard of subsection (a) is not treated more strictly than the general view of standing. Adams v. Pipeliners Union 798, 699 P.2d 343 (Alaska 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       To give standing all that is necessary is a sufficient personal stake in the controversy to guarantee the adversity which is fundamental to judicial proceedings. Adams v. Pipeliners Union 798, 699 P.2d 343 (Alaska 1985).

        Case-closing decisions subject to review. —

      </p>
      <p>
       This section did not authorize review of a closing order of the executive director of the commission in a discrimination case; however, the section does not express an affirmative legislative intention that case-closing decisions of the executive director or staff be judicially unreviewable, and such decisions are reviewable if they have the requisite finality. Department of Fish &amp; Game, Sport Fish Div. v. Meyer, 906 P.2d 1365 (Alaska 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the legislature intended to allow the courts to determine whether an agency’s withholding of action is unreasonable or unlawful, where the case-closing decision of the executive director of the commission in a discrimination case was the final action of the agency, it was ripe for judicial review. Department of Fish &amp; Game, Sport Fish Div. v. Meyer, 906 P.2d 1365 (Alaska 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a discrimination case, presumption that a case-closing decision of the executive director of the commission was unreviewable as an enforcement decision committed to the commission’s prosecutorial discretion did not apply. Department of Fish &amp; Game, Sport Fish Div. v. Meyer, 906 P.2d 1365 (Alaska 1995).

       When an action is brought under AS 22.10.020(i), the plaintiff shall serve a copy of the complaint on the commission.  Upon timely application, the commission may intervene as a party to the action as a matter of right. If the commission certifies in writing to the court that it is presently investigating or actively dealing with the act, practice, or policy of the defendant giving rise to the cause of action, the court shall, at the request of the commission, defer proceedings for a period of not more than 45 days or such extended period as the court may allow; except that the court may enter an order or injunction if necessary to prevent irreparable injury to the plaintiff.

       If, within the period allowed, a hearing is conducted and a decision is reached under AS 18.80.120 and 18.80.130, the decision of the commission is binding on the parties to the court action as to all issues resolved in the hearing but not as to any issues not resolved in the hearing.

        Purpose of section. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section provides a mechanism by which the commission and the superior court may avoid jurisdictional conflict over actions brought under this chapter. Johnson v. Alaska State Dep't of Fish &amp; Game, 836 P.2d 896 (Alaska 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b) makes no distinction between issues of law and issues of fact.

      <p>
       <b>
        Issue preclusion. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (d) does not mean that issue preclusion is inapplicable to cases where the commission does not intervene under subsection (a) but determines that discrimination has taken place. Johnson v. Alaska State Dep't of Fish &amp; Game, 836 P.2d 896 (Alaska 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       No language in this section suggests that issue preclusion can obtain only when the commission has requested deferral. On the contrary, the statute simply makes clear that commission decisions and orders rendered within the deferral period must receive issue preclusive effect. Such a deferential scheme clearly suggests that the commission’s decisions should carry issue preclusive effect in an appropriate case. Johnson v. Alaska State Dep't of Fish &amp; Game, 836 P.2d 896 (Alaska 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee’s claim for back pay was not barred because he did not have the opportunity to assert the claim before the Human Rights Commission; employee did not control his claim for back pay and therefore did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate it, and res judicata did not preclude him from pursuing the claim in superior court. Beegan v. State, 195 P.3d 134 (Alaska 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee’s claim in superior court for back pay was not barred by collateral estoppel because the Human Rights Commission neither decided the question of back pay damages nor issued a final judgment on the matter; indeed, it clearly acknowledged that no back pay damages claim was before it. Beegan v. State, 195 P.3d 134 (Alaska 2008).

       It is determined and declared as a matter of legislative finding that discrimination against an inhabitant of the state because of race, religion, color, national origin, age, sex, physical or mental disability, marital status, changes in marital status, pregnancy, or parenthood is a matter of public concern and that this discrimination not only threatens the rights and privileges of the inhabitants of the state but also menaces the institutions of the state and threatens peace, order, health, safety, and general welfare of the state and its inhabitants.

      <li id="t18c80a04s18.80.200ol1b">
       Therefore, it is the policy of the state and the purpose of this chapter to eliminate and prevent discrimination in employment, in credit and financing practices, in places of public accommodation, in the sale, lease, or rental of real property because of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, changes in marital status, pregnancy or parenthood.  It is also the policy of the state to encourage and enable physically and mentally disabled persons to participate fully in the social and economic life of the state and to engage in remunerative employment. It is not the purpose of this chapter to supersede laws pertaining to child labor, the age of majority, or other age restrictions or requirements.

       The “insuring and risk characteristics” between otherwise similarly-situated married and unmarried couples are different; to the extent discrimination on the basis of such a distinction is not prevented under a specific statute or constitutional provision, it survives the general anti-discrimination statutory challenge; while an insurance company may not be free to completely deny insurance coverage to unmarried couples, premiums might be different as between married and unmarried couples.

       While the Commission failed to further delineate its reasoning for dismissing the case or why continued prosecution would not represent the best use of its resources, neither the Commission's authorizing statute nor the constitutional right to due process require the Commission to explicitly connect its ultimate decision not to issue an accusation to relevant evidence in the record; inferences were acceptable, and the court could infer a range of legitimate reasons in this case.

       Because discrimination on the basis of citizenship has the effect of discriminating on the basis of national origin, this section and AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c80a04s18.80.255" target="_self">18.80.255</a></cite> make it clear that an employer, including the state or any of its political subdivisions, may not discriminate against a potential or existing employee because that person is not a citizen of the United States. April 14, 1975 Op. Att’y Gen.

      <p>
       Subsection (b) should be interpreted to require the commission to keep confidential information from a survey for records maintained to administer civil rights laws and regulations until it is presented at public hearing unless the information is released in a format which does not identify individual responding employers or unions.

       An employment decision not to hire one who lives with a person of the opposite sex does not come within the prohibition against employment decisions based on marital status.

      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) preserves the nonassociational rights of those public employees whose sincere and conscientious beliefs forbid union membership but who, because they are not members of an organized religion, do not come within the coverage of AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.23.html#t23c40a02s23.40.225" target="_blank">23.40.225</a></cite>.

      <p>
       Where defendant alleged racial discrimination in his firing, but the employer demonstrated that there were substantive grounds for dismissal and that the racial discrimination claim had been investigated and no evidence of racial discrimination was found, and where the defendant alleged age and disability discrimination, but again offered no evidence to support his claim other than his opinion and hearsay statements, summary judgment for the employer on all claims was justified.

       Employee established a prima facie case of discrimination, but the employer provided non-discriminatory reasons for its decision to hire the less-senior Caucasian employee for a temporary assignment because the employer did not have faith that the employee would fulfill his obligations; the employee failed to corroborate his allegations and the Commission correctly decided there was not substantial evidence that the employer discriminated against the employee based on his race.

       Because a state agency engaged in the interactive process required by the Americans with Disabilities Act once it was informed of plaintiff's post-traumatic stress disorder and her need for accommodation, and because the agency promptly granted her accommodation, summary judgment for the agency was proper on plaintiff's claim for failure to accommodate.

        Breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Reasonable jury could find an employer breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and an employee was not disabled because the jury could find (1) the employer acted unfairly in providing a description of the employee's job to an independent medical examiner which gave the employer an excuse to fire the employer but that the employee was not disabled, or (2) the employer lawfully fired the employee due to an inability to perform the essential functions of the employee's job with or without a reasonable accommodation.

        Discharge held proper. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly approved a borough personnel board's affirmation of an employee's discharge because he made statements to his supervisor and counselor that were relayed to the supervisor that a reasonable person could have interpreted as conveying an intent to cause physical harm, the ADA and the Alaska Human Rights Act did not preclude the employer from discharging an employee who was unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position due to the employee's violations of the employer's workplace violence policies, and a reasonable accommodation finding was superfluous since the employee did not argue or show that he was terminated due to prejudice against him as a disabled person.
   Nicolos v. N. Slope Borough, 424 P.3d 318 (Alaska 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a former employee alleged that an employer had unlawfully discriminated against her when the employer changed the employee's position to a temporary position and eventually terminated her due to her pregnancy and parenthood, the employer was entitled to summary judgment because the employee chose to move into a special projects position, as it allowed her to work from home, and the special projects position was ultimately terminated when the special projects ended.

      <p>
       Although this section, construed to prohibit absolutely age discrimination, may extend the uniform requirements of the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq., it does not discriminate against interstate businesses and is indistinguishable from a plethora of other means of regulations which vary from state to state.

       Congress intended only to establish “minimum” standards in the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq., which prohibits employment discrimination based on age for persons 40 through 64. Simpson v. Alaska State Comm'n for Human Rights, 423 F. Supp. 552 (D. Alaska 1976), aff'd, 608 F.2d 1171 (9th Cir. Alaska 1979).

      <p>
       Compliance with both this section and the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq., which prohibits employment discrimination based on age for persons 40 through 64, is possible even though Alaska’s statute is more inclusive than the federal statute.

      <p>
       Since there are no specific conflicts between the state and federal statutes and since Congress has expressly left the states the power to act in this field, the fact that Alaska has gone beyond the federal government in enacting a complementary scheme in this area does not make the Alaska law void. Simpson v. Alaska State Comm'n for Human Rights, 423 F. Supp. 552 (D. Alaska 1976), aff'd, 608 F.2d 1171 (9th Cir. Alaska 1979).

       The National Labor Relations Act, under the principle of federal preemption, does not deprive the Alaska courts of jurisdiction to hear cases of alleged employment discrimination by either employers or unions on the basis of religion. Bald v. RCA Alascom, 569 P.2d 1328 (Alaska 1977).

      </p>
      <p>
       When a former employee said a former employer fired the employee for reporting sexual harassment, dismissing the employee's claims for lack of exhaustion was error because the employee did not clearly and unmistakably waive the right to sue in state court in a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) subject to the Railway Labor Act (RLA). The CBA only allowed union or employer appeals and had no statutory anti-discrimination requirements, and the RLA did not preempt claims under
   AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c80a04s18.80.220" target="_self">18.80.220</a></cite>, public policy, and breach of good faith and fair dealing; the first two did not depend on the CBA, and the third was not preempted in the context of retaliatory discharge, since the CBA could not define the right to report public policy violations.

       The state law duty to accommodate is potentially governed by a federal law limitation contained in the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 158-159, which authorizes a union shop and allows the discharge of an employee who does not pay union dues.

      </p>

       Whether an environment is “hostile” or “abusive” can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances.

       State was entitled to summary judgment in an action for race and national origin discrimination because the state presented substantial evidence showing that hiring managers for each of the 15 positions applicant applied for had legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for hiring other individuals, and applicant presented nothing more than unsupported assumptions and speculations that the state’s offered reasons (hiring of more qualified candidates or candidates who followed application directions) were pretextual.

        Burden of proof in disparate treatment action. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An employee’s prima facie case of employment discrimination based on disparate treatment of different sexes will be rebutted if the employer articulates lawful reasons for the disparate treatment; to satisfy this burden, the employer need only produce admissible evidence which would allow the trier of fact rationally to conclude that the employment decision was not motivated by discriminatory animus. The employer is not allowed to compose fictitious, post-hoc justifications for any disparate treatment; rather, the employer must articulate legitimate business reasons existing at the time the employment decision was made. If the employer does so, the burden shifts back to the employee, who may attempt to prove that the proferred reasons are pretextual.

       A telephone utility’s need to recruit trained plant workers, in the face of a burgeoning demand for phone services and stiff competition from other employers for skilled employees, constitutes a legitimate business reason for negotiating a higher wage increase with the electrical workers union for predominantly male plant workers than for predominantly female traffic, commercial, and clerical forces. Thomas v. Anchorage Tel. Util., 741 P.2d 618 (Alaska 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the trial court found that an “advantageous” shift differential was paid to a predominantly male plant force only on a temporary or emergency basis, while a predominantly female clerical force received its “less advantageous” shift differential regularly, the distinction between “temporary” and “regular” availability of the varying shift differentials supported a legitimate business reason for the disparity. Thomas v. Anchorage Tel. Util., 741 P.2d 618 (Alaska 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where all benefits were provided equally to employees of a telephone utility regardless of salary with the one exception of employee life insurance, which, as a matter of city-wide policy, was a function of annual salary, and the record contained evidence that this is standard practice and eases administration of insurance benefits, the trial court correctly found that the insurance plan was supported by legitimate business reasons, despite the argument that men in higher paying plant jobs received more insurance than women in lower paying clerical jobs.

       Summary judgment was properly granted to an employer in a racial discrimination case under this section where it showed a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for failing to hire an applicant; internal candidates were preferred for one position, and the person hired had more relevant experience than the applicant for another job: moreover, there was no showing of pretext for the second position since the person hired had not been convicted of a felony, and a driver’s license was not required.

      </p>
      <p>
       To present a prima facie case of employment discrimination based on the disparate impact of employment practices on different sexes, the employee must show that a facially neutral employment act, practice, or policy has a significant discriminatory impact on a protected group.
   Once the employee has made this showing, the employer has the burden of proving that his actions are justified by a business necessity or job-relatedness.
   The employer has the burden of persuasion on this issue.
   If the employer establishes a business necessity or job-relatedness, then the employee has an opportunity to prove that other acts or practices could accomplish the employer’s legitimate interest with a less discriminatory impact. Thomas v. Anchorage Tel. Util., 741 P.2d 618 (Alaska 1987).

        Claim preclusive effect. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section establishes a type of claim preclusive effect for particular decisions adverse to claimants or plaintiffs. However, no statute specifically creates claim preclusive effects when the claimants or plaintiffs prevail. Indeed, when claimants before the commission prevail, their claim does not merge into the favorable judgment. Rather, they are still free to bring subsequent action under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.22.html#t22c10s22.10.020ol1i" target="_blank">22.10.020(i)</a></cite> in superior court, because the remedies available in court are different than those available before the commission. Johnson v. Alaska State Dep't of Fish &amp; Game, 836 P.2d 896 (Alaska 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       When discrimination complaints are before both the human rights commission and superior court at the same time and the commission does not seek to defer court proceedings or ultimately does not hold an adjudicatory hearing, superior court has complete jurisdiction of the case, notwithstanding the provisions of this section; it is no different when the commission fails to hold a hearing and closes a case before a complaint is filed in superior court, where the commission never adjudicates the merits of a discrimination claim, there is no acquittal of the accused party, and where there is no acquittal, the complainant’s superior court claims are not foreclosed by this section.

Continued representation of the person by the Public Defender Agency after the hearing is held under AS 47.10.142(d) is contingent on satisfaction of the eligibility requirements of (a) — (d) of this section, the issuance of an appropriate court order, and compliance with the applicable laws and court rules relating to court-appointed counsel employed at the public’s expense. If a person who was represented by the Public Defender Agency at public expense without a court order in connection with a hearing held under AS 47.10.142(d) is not later determined to be eligible for court-appointed counsel at public expense under applicable laws and court rules, the court shall assess against the represented person the cost to the Public Defender Agency of providing the representation. In this subsection, “guardian” means a natural person who is legally appointed guardian of the person of a child.

       Parts of a section are construed so as to produce a harmonious whole, and the supreme court assumes, therefore, that the attorney services and facilities to be publicly funded are the same necessary services and facilities of this representation, including investigation and other preparation; “this representation” is the representation “by an attorney,” which is to be provided to the same extent as it would be to a person retaining an attorney.

        Hertz v. State
       </i>
       , 755 P.2d 406 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988), that an attorney representing an indigent petitioner for post-conviction relief should never be allowed to withdraw, but should be required to pursue the petition even if the attorney has concluded that it is frivolous. However, a certificate filed under Alaska Crim. R. 35.1(e)(2)(B) must contain a detailed explanation of why the attorney has concluded that the petitioner has no colorable grounds for post-conviction relief.

       <b>
        The supreme court has defined a “criminal prosecution”
       </b>
       as any offense for which incarceration could be a direct penalty, and from this definition have flowed the rights to jury trial and court-appointed counsel in misdemeanor cases, based upon constitutional considerations. Public Defender Agency v. Superior Court, Third Judicial Dist., 534 P.2d 947 (Alaska 1975).

        “Serious crime”. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since an indigent defendant is entitled to representation by counsel when prosecuted for an offense the direct penalty for which may be incarceration, loss of a valuable license, or a fine heavy enough to indicate criminality, it follows that any such offense is a serious matter and a “serious crime” within the meaning of the Public Defender Act (AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c85s18.85.010" target="_self">18.85.010</a></cite> et seq.). Therefore, a defendant charged with any such misdemeanor who cannot afford to hire his own lawyer is eligible for representation by the public defender. Alexander v. Anchorage, 490 P.2d 910 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because defendant was indigent, and he was appealing his conviction of a “serious crime” for violating two municipal ordinances, defendant was entitled to court-appointed appellate counsel under this section. Latham v. Municipality of Anchorage, 165 P.3d 663 (Alaska Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 974, 129 S. Ct. 481, 172 L. Ed. 2d 334 (U.S. 2008).

        Determinations of eligibility for appointment of counsel. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska Adm. R. 12(b)(2) requires that determinations of eligibility for appointment of counsel must be made in accordance with the provisions of Alaska Crim. R. 39, even when an appointment concerns not a criminal matter but a CINA proceeding, because Alaska Adm. R. 12(b)(1) refers to appointments under subsection (a) of this section. Office of Pub. Advocacy v. Superior Court, Second Judicial Dist., 3 P.3d 932 (Alaska), cert. denied, Samra v. Alabama, 531 U.S. 933, 121 S. Ct. 317, 148 L. Ed. 2d 255 (U.S. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant contended that he was indigent, a superior court had a duty to determine indigency under Alaska R. Crim. P. 39.1(e) by asking defendant about his financial status under oath or by requiring him to complete a signed and sworn financial statement; it was not dispositive that defendant had a large amount of bail returned. Benson v. State, 160 P.3d 161 (Alaska Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       A prisoner’s challenge of disciplinary findings related to prison conduct violations did not require the appointment of a public defender. The violations did not constitute a serious crime, nor was the defendant making claims pertaining to his status as a parent or as a witness, or to post-conviction relief.

       Superior court was correct in appointing public counsel for mother’s boyfriend because the evidence was legally sufficient to determine he was a child's biological father; the sworn testimony of the mother and the boyfriend indicated that he was the father, and the court made appropriate inquiries regarding birth certificate, the mother's marital status, and the certainty of the mother and the boyfriend regarding paternity.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although the legislature, at the time of enactment of this chapter, may not have foreseen the development of the law in the area of enforcement of child support orders and, therefore, might not have foreseen the precise application of this chapter to defendants in contempt for nonsupport proceedings, there is no indication that it intended to exclude this class of defendants from representation.

       The offense of harassment as defined in an ordinance was not a “serious crime”
   
   within this meaning of AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c85s18.85.170" target="_self">18.85.170</a></cite>(5), where no provision had been made for imprisonment for violation of the ordinance and the maximum punishment was a $100.00 fine; harassment did not connote traditional criminal conduct; and contemporary social values were not so offended as to cause the conduct involved to connote criminality in the constitutional sense. Therefore, the Alaska Public Defender Agency had no authority to represent a person who was accused of such offense. Alaska Pub. Defender Agency, Juneau Office v. Superior Court of First Judicial Dist., 584 P.2d 1106 (Alaska 1978).

   AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.22.html#t22c15s22.15.270" target="_blank">22.15.270</a></cite>, most of the major political subdivisions of the state have entered into contractual arrangements with the Alaska court system whereby the political subdivision has agreed to pay the salaries of the district judges, and all other costs of running the courts, which are attributable to prosecutions initiated by the political subdivision.
   Since the cost of providing counsel seems indistinguishable from the cost of providing these judicial services, it should be treated in the same way.
   Alexander v. Anchorage, 490 P.2d 910 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Expense of a party's travel to court is generally not a cost that could be included in those “taxed by the court” against the other party, and the legislature is therefore unlikely to have intended “court costs” to include the defendant's travel.
   Alaska Pub. Def. Agency v. Superior Court, 450 P.3d 246 (Alaska 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals erred in upholding a decision requiring the public defender agency to pay the travel expenses for a juvenile to the site of his juvenile delinquency proceeding because neither the Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) nor the Agency was legally obligated to pay such costs; neither the DJJ's nor the Agency's authorizing statutes required them to pay the travel expenses for out-of-custody indigent juvenile defendants to attend their delinquency proceedings.
   Alaska Pub. Def. Agency v. Superior Court, 450 P.3d 246 (Alaska 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the definition of “expenses:” is read broadly enough to include travel expenses, the Alaska Public Defender Act does not impose those expenses on the public defender agency, and the legislature did not use the word “expenses” anywhere in the Act except in its definition of “indigent person”; The legislature used different and more precise terms when describing what the Agency had to provide “at public expense”: attorney services and facilities and court costs.

   Alaska Legal Servs. Corp. v. Thomas, 623 P.2d 342 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly ordered the Public Defender Agency to pay for the travel expenses of one of a juvenile's parents to the trial venue because the family was indigent, and inasmuch as the administrative code authorized the Office of Public Advocacy to pay necessary travel of an indigent defendant or juvenile delinquency defendant represented by the Public Defender Agency, the same should be applied to an indigent defendant who was not in custody and who was unable to afford to travel to the site of the trial, and when a delinquency case involved a minor who was not reasonably able to travel alone, the agency should pay for a parent or guardian to accompany the minor.

       Alaska Public Defender Agency (Agency) could not be appointed as “standby” or “advisory” counsel when a defendant elected to represent himself or herself because (1) standby counsel did not “represent” the defendant, and AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c85s18.85.100ol1a" target="_self">18.85.100(a)</a></cite> only authorized the Agency to represent defendants.

      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether defendant’s waiver of his earlier request for counsel was constitutionally effective and, consequently, whether his statements could be admitted against him, the trial court also had to have found, as a preliminary matter, that defendant had initiated the discussions with the police leading to his confession.

      <p>
       Although paragraph (c)(1) limits the right to counsel to a first petition for post-conviction relief, when litigation of the defendant’s claim would be unfair unless the defendant is assisted by counsel, the Alaska Constitution’s guarantee of due process of law mandates that a court have the authority to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant. Grinols v. State, 10 P.3d 600 (Alaska Ct. App. 2000), aff'd in part, 74 P.3d 889 (Alaska 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because an indigent defendant has a right to effective counsel under both
   Alaska Const. art. I, § 7 and subsection (c) of this section in a first application for post-conviction relief, that defendant must be given the opportunity to challenge the effectiveness of counsel in a second petition for post-conviction relief.
   Grinols v. State, 74 P.3d 889 (Alaska 2003).

   Alex v. State, 210 P.3d 1225 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).

      <p>
       Because appellant was represented by the Public Defender Agency in the trial court, and his assistant public defender filed a certificate of no arguable merit after investigating appellant’s potential claims for post-conviction relief, this meant that the duty of providing an attorney for appellant on appeal fell to the Office of Public Advocacy pursuant to this section.

        Constitutionality of recoupment. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Recoupment systems in which the means of collecting defense costs are significantly more onerous and less protective of debtors’ interests than those available for the collection of private debts are generally invalid. However, systems containing the significantly more onerous power to condition freedom from incarceration on payment of recoupment are not invalid so long as they contain safeguards designed to ensure that only those who will be able to pay are required to pay. State v. Albert, 899 P.2d 103 (Alaska 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska’s recoupment system does not violate the right to counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the United States Constitution. Recoupment judgments are nondiscriminatory and there are no correctional consequences if payment is not made. The same protections against hardship available to civil debtors provided in the exemption act are available to recoupment debtors and recoupment debtors have the additional right to petition the court for reduction or remission of a judgment based on a showing of manifest hardship to the debtor or members of the debtor’s immediate family. Additionally, the debtor is notified at the outset of the criminal proceedings of the possibility of a recoupment judgment and given an opportunity to challenge entry of the judgment before it is entered. State v. Albert, 899 P.2d 103 (Alaska 1995).
      </p>

        Release of information under subsection (d). —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s sworn testimony and notarized financial statements under subsection (b) were an integral part of the oath of indigency required of him under subsection (d). Thus, the information disclosed was “received under” subsection (d). State v. Hofseth, 822 P.2d 1376 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence resulting from an investigation prompted by release of information under subsection (d) may generally be used only to prosecute for perjury. The general rule is subject to two exceptions. First, when a perjury investigation originates from disclosure of information submitted in support of a fraudulent application for court-appointed counsel or from disclosure of statements that are shown to have been perjured, then prosecution of incidental crimes discovered during the investigation is not barred. Second, when a perjury investigation stemming from a disclosure under subsection (d) fortuitously yields evidence of misconduct essentially unrelated to the type of information in the disclosed materials, then the attenuation doctrine will apply, and the misconduct may be prosecuted. State v. Hofseth, 822 P.2d 1376 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The prohibition in subsection (d) against release of “information that might incriminate or tend to incriminate” an applicant for court-appointed counsel cannot be construed to preclude disclosure for purposes of a perjury prosecution. Insofar as the Public Defender Act’s confidentiality provisions may be likened to an assurance of immunity, it is clear that the immunity would not extend to prosecution for false statements made in connection with applications for public representation. State v. Hofseth, 822 P.2d 1376 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because an applicant who has the wherewithal to pay for an attorney and knows that fact is in no sense compelled to declare indigency for purposes of obtaining court-appointed counsel, none of the subsidiary information provided to support a fraudulent application could be deemed compelled, whether truthful or not. Disclosure of that information would not violate the right against self-incrimination, and prosecution of any crimes based on the disclosure would be the fruit of no such violation. State v. Hofseth, 822 P.2d 1376 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).

      <p>
       Where defendant contended that he was indigent, a superior court had a duty to determine indigency under Alaska R. Crim. P. 39.1(e) by asking defendant about his financial status under oath or by requiring him to complete a signed and sworn financial statement; it was not dispositive that defendant had a large amount of bail returned.

       Reconstruction of a record was not appropriate where there was no indication in the log notes that the required procedures were followed to determine if defendant was indigent; moreover, it made no sense that defendant would have conceded that he had the ability to hire counsel since he had contended that he was forced to represent himself at trial; on remand, the hearing could have been reconstructed and used by the superior court to determine if defendant had the resources to hire counsel at the time of his trial.

       and a criminal matter under this section is one in which a person is entitled to representation either under the state or federal constitutions. Public Defender Agency v. Superior Court, Third Judicial Dist., 534 P.2d 947 (Alaska 1975).

      </p>
      <p>
       Since an indigent defendant is entitled to representation by counsel when prosecuted for an offense the direct penalty for which may be incarceration, loss of a valuable license, or a fine heavy enough to indicate criminality, it follows that any such offense is a serious matter and a “serious crime” within the meaning of the Public Defender Act (AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t18c85s18.85.010" target="_self">18.85.010</a></cite> et seq.). Therefore, a defendant charged with any such misdemeanor who cannot afford to hire his own lawyer is eligible for representation by the public defender. Alexander v. Anchorage, 490 P.2d 910 (Alaska 1971).

      <p>
       <b>
        The supreme court has defined a “criminal prosecution”
       </b>
       as any offense for which incarceration could be a direct penalty, and from this definition have flowed the rights to jury trial and court-appointed counsel in misdemeanor cases, based upon constitutional considerations. Public Defender Agency v. Superior Court, Third Judicial Dist., 534 P.2d 947 (Alaska 1975).

        Civil contempt for nonsupport proceedings. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Under paragraph (5)(A), the public defender is empowered to represent an indigent defendant in a civil contempt for nonsupport proceeding. Public Defender Agency v. Superior Court, Third Judicial Dist., 534 P.2d 947 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the legislature, at the time of enactment of this chapter, may not have foreseen the development of the law in the area of enforcement of child support orders and, therefore, might not have foreseen the precise application of this chapter to defendants in contempt for nonsupport proceedings, there is no indication that it intended to exclude this class of defendants from representation. Public Defender Agency v. Superior Court, Third Judicial Dist., 534 P.2d 947 (Alaska 1975).

        The offense of harassment as defined in an ordinance
       </b>
       was not a “serious crime” within the meaning of subsection (5) of this section, where no provision had been made for imprisonment for violation of the ordinance and the maximum punishment was a $100.00 fine; harassment did not connote traditional criminal conduct; and contemporary social values were not so offended as to cause the conduct involved to connote criminality in the constitutional sense. Therefore, the Alaska Public Defender Agency had no authority to represent a person who was accused of this offense.

        Payment of costs. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Based upon AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.22.html#t22c15s22.15.270" target="_blank">22.15.270</a></cite>, most of the major political subdivisions of the state have entered into contractual arrangements with the Alaska court system whereby the political subdivision has agreed to pay the salaries of the district judges, and all other costs of running the courts which are attributable to prosecutions initiated by the political subdivision.
   Since the cost of providing counsel seems indistinguishable from the cost of providing these judicial services, it should be treated in the same way. Alexander v. Anchorage, 490 P.2d 910 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Expense of a party's travel to court is generally not a cost that could be included in those “taxed by the court” against the other party, and the legislature is therefore unlikely to have intended “court costs” to include the defendant's travel.
   Alaska Pub. Def. Agency v. Superior Court, 450 P.3d 246 (Alaska 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the definition of “expenses:” is read broadly enough to include travel expenses, the Alaska Public Defender Act does not impose those expenses on the public defender agency, and the legislature did not use the word “expenses” anywhere in the Act except in its definition of “indigent person”; The legislature used different and more precise terms when describing what the Agency had to provide “at public expense”: attorney services and facilities and court costs.
