    Although AS 13.36 is part of the Alaska Uniform Probate Code, AS 13.36 (Trust Administration) is not included in this table because these trust provisions were based on Article VII of the UPC and Article VII was withdrawn from the UPC in 2010 due to the widespread enactment of the Uniform Trust Code.

       Daughter’s complaint against her siblings involving their father’s estate was untimely where the statute of limitations was not tolled by alleged fraud or equitable estoppel. A stock transfer and the transfer of certain other assets were consistent with decedent’s known wishes, and no fraud was committed in connection with the estate. Williams v. Williams, 129 P.3d 428 (Alaska 2006).

      In addition to the Alaska Rules of Evidence, the following rules relating to a determination of death and status apply:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t13c06a01s13.06.035ol11">
       death occurs when an individual has sustained either irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions or irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem; a determination of death shall be made under accepted medical standards;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c06a01s13.06.035ol12">
       a certified or authenticated copy of a death certificate purporting to be issued by an official or agency of the place where the death purportedly occurred is prima facie evidence of the fact, place, date, and time of death and the identity of the decedent;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c06a01s13.06.035ol13">
       a certified or authenticated copy of a record or report of a governmental agency, domestic or foreign, that an individual is missing, detained, dead, or alive is prima facie evidence of the status and of the dates, circumstances, and places disclosed by the record or report;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c06a01s13.06.035ol14">
       in the absence of prima facie evidence of death under (2) or (3) of this section, the fact of death may be established by clear and convincing evidence, including circumstantial evidence;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c06a01s13.06.035ol15">
       an individual whose death is not established under (1) — (4) of this section and who is absent for a continuous period of five years, during which the individual has not been heard from, and whose absence is not satisfactorily explained after diligent search or inquiry, is presumed to be dead; the individual’s death is presumed to have occurred at the end of the period unless there is sufficient evidence for determining that death occurred earlier;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c06a01s13.06.035ol16">
       in the absence of evidence disputing the time of death stated on a document described in (2) or (3) of this section, a document described in (2) or (3) of this section that states a time of death 120 hours or more after the time of death of another individual, however the time of death of the other individual is determined, establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the individual survived the other individual by at least 120 hours.

       Although it is often said that life is presumed to continue, it is well settled that this so-called presumption is overcome when the person is shown to have been exposed to a serious danger at or about the time of his disappearance.

       Where an insurance beneficiary relies upon the statutory presumption of death arising from the insured’s disappearance, the applicable six-year statute of limitations period for actions on contracts begins to run on the date the presumptive death period expires.
   Moreover, it is reasonable to presume a demand for payment under the policy and an immediate rejection by the insurer on the date the presumptive death period expires. Carman v. Prudential Ins. Co., 748 P.2d 743 (Alaska 1988).

       A husband's will did not control the property disposition at issue because the court made no finding regarding the nature of the document and whether it was a post-nuptial agreement; it appeared that the parties attempted to create a present property agreement so the husband would have separate property ultimately passing to his children by intestate succession.

       Boat and skiff were properly treated as the individual property of an intestate decedent’s husband, even though they were purchased during the marriage with marital funds, because his name alone was on the title and thus he was the presumptive owner. The equitable distribution framework for divorce proceedings does not apply in probate proceedings. Pestrikoff v. Hoff, 278 P.3d 281 (Alaska 2012).

       The heir obtains title by descent, and not through the process of the probate court.
   His title vests immediately upon the death of the ancestor, and the only jurisdiction through probate lies to enforce the lien of the ancestor’s debts against the real property.
   If there are no debts, the heir becomes vested at once with a complete title. Binswanger v. Henninger, 1 Alaska 509 (D. Alaska 1902).

     <p>
      An individual who fails to survive the decedent by 120 hours is considered to have predeceased the decedent for purposes of homestead allowance, exempt property, and intestate succession, and the decedent’s heirs are determined accordingly. If it is not established by clear and convincing evidence that an individual who would otherwise be an heir survived the decedent by 120 hours, it is considered that the individual failed to survive for the required period.

       It was error to include wrongful death proceeds to a surviving spouse in the augmented estate as an offset against her elective share because any interest in wrongful death proceeds is not owned by the surviving spouse at the time of the decedent’s death.

       In a probate case involving decedent wife’s estate, the superior court erred by finding that the husband’s unconscionable conduct warranted establishing a constructive trust to give the estate the husband’s statutory benefits. The husband was entitled to marital allowances and a share of the estate based solely on the existence of a valid marriage. Riddell v. Edwards, 76 P.3d 847 (Alaska 2003).

      </p>
      <p>
       A party attempting to set aside a nuptial agreement for material non-performance must show a total breach. To warrant rescission, the breach must be material and the failure to perform so substantial as to defeat the object of the parties in making the agreement. A breach which goes to only a part of the consideration, which is incidental and subordinate to the main purpose of the contract, does not warrant rescission. Estate of Lampert ex rel. Thurston v. Estate of Lampert, 896 P.2d 214 (Alaska 1995) (decided under former AS 13.11.085).

       In a probate case involving decedent wife’s estate, the superior court erred by finding that the husband’s unconscionable conduct warranted establishing a constructive trust to give the estate the husband’s statutory benefits. The husband was entitled to marital allowances and a share of the estate based solely on the existence of a valid marriage. Riddell v. Edwards, 76 P.3d 847 (Alaska 2003).

    Exempt property.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to the homestead allowance, the decedent’s surviving spouse is entitled from the estate to a value, not exceeding $10,000 in excess of security interests in the items, in household furniture, automobiles, furnishings, appliances, and personal effects. If there is no surviving spouse, the decedent’s children are entitled jointly to the same value. If encumbered chattels are selected and the value in excess of security interests, plus that of other exempt property, is less than $10,000, or if there is not $10,000 worth of exempt property in the estate, the spouse or children are entitled to other assets of the estate, if any, to the extent necessary to make up the $10,000 value. Rights to exempt property and assets needed to make up a deficiency of exempt property have priority over all claims against the estate, but the right to assets to make up a deficiency of exempt property abates as necessary to permit earlier payment of homestead allowance and family allowance. These rights are in addition to a benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or children by the decedent’s will, unless otherwise provided, by intestate succession, or by way of elective share.

      </p>
      <p>
       Alleged child's paternity claim in a probate proceeding was not time-barred because (1) the claim was not a separate cause of action under
   AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c12a01s13.12.114" target="_self">13.12.114</a></cite> subject to a statute of limitations, as the statute only created a procedure to establish paternity pursuant to
   AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.25.html#t25c20s25.20.050" target="_blank">25.20.050</a></cite>, and (2) no probate code time bar applied, since the non-claim statute did not apply to the exempt property allowance, as assertions of right to the allowance were not "claims against a decedent's estate," the right was asserted while the estate was open, so estate-closing statutes did not apply, and the statute of limitations in the code of civil procedure did not bar the claim which accrued at the decedent's death.

       In addition to the right to homestead allowance and exempt property, the decedent’s surviving spouse and minor children whom the decedent was obligated to support and children who were in fact being supported by the decedent are entitled to a reasonable allowance in money out of the estate for their maintenance during the period of administration. The allowance may not continue for longer than one year if the estate is inadequate to discharge allowed claims. The allowance may be paid as a lump sum or in periodic installments. It is payable to the surviving spouse, if living, for the use of the surviving spouse and minor and dependent children; otherwise it is payable to the children, or persons having their care and custody. If a minor child or dependent child is not living with the surviving spouse, the allowance may be made partially to the child or the child’s guardian or other person having the child’s care and custody, and partially to the spouse, as their needs may appear. The family allowance is exempt from and has priority over all claims except the homestead allowance.

       The family allowance is not chargeable against a benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or children by the will of the decedent, unless otherwise provided, by intestate succession, or by way of elective share.

       A widow’s allowance or allowance for family support has for its purpose the setting off of a certain amount of money or property, so that the surviving wife (and dependent children if there be any) might continue to have support and to provide necessities therefor during the period of administration. 16 Alaska 377.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is reasonable to find in the statute the objective of continuing, after death, the support which a widow had been receiving, or to then afford her the support to which she had been entitled, but which her husband, in violation of his obligations, had failed to provide. In re Estate of Hewett, 358 P.2d 579 (Alaska 1961).

       The fact that a woman is apart from her husband and that he does not support her during the separation would not, in itself, relieve him from the duty to continue to support her during marriage, but when this fact is coupled with other matters which taken together show that that duty ceased to exist prior to the husband’s death, then the wife waived or abandoned her right to demand support from her husband.

   It deals only with family allowances and states that they have priority over all claims with unmistakable clarity. Alaska Statute <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c16a08s13.16.470ol1a" target="_self">13.16.470(a)</a></cite>, on the other hand, is much broader.

       The wording of former AS 13.11.135(a) itself casts doubt on whether family allowances were meant to be included within the meaning of the word “claims.” It states that family allowances have priority over “all claims,” not “all other claims.” In re Estate of Hutchinson, 577 P.2d 1074 (Alaska 1978).

The personal representative may execute an instrument or deed of distribution to establish the ownership of property taken as homestead allowance or exempt property. The personal representative may determine the family allowance in a lump sum not exceeding $18,000 or periodic installments not exceeding $1,500 per month for one year, and may disburse funds of the estate in payment of the family allowance and any part of the homestead allowance payable in cash.

        Two particular functions of mind must be sound
       </b>
       in order to create capacity for the making of a will; for there must be memory to recall the several persons who may be supposed to be in such a position as to become the fitting objects of the testator’s bounty; above all, there must be understanding to comprehend their relations to himself and their claims upon him. Chrisman v. Chrisman, 16 Ore. 127, 18 P. 6 (Or. 1888).

        What testator must be able to understand. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The testator must be able to understand the nature of the act in which he is engaged, the kind and extent of his property, and the claims of those who are the natural objects of his bounty. In re Walther's Estate, 177 Ore. 382, 163 P.2d 285 (Or. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       The testator’s mind should apprehend, without prompting, who are the natural objects of his bounty. In re Walther's Estate, 177 Ore. 382, 163 P.2d 285 (Or. 1945).

        How undue influence measured. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Undue influence is measured, not by degree, but by effect. If it destroys free agency, it is undue.
   Moreover, the undue influence that constrains must be present, operating upon the other mind of the testator in the very act of making the will. In re Allen's Estate, 116 Ore. 467, 241 P. 996 (Or. 1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Motive and opportunity for the exercise of undue influence are not enough.
       </b>
       There must be proof that undue influence actually was exercised. In re Andersen's Estate, 192 Ore. 441, 235 P.2d 869 (Or. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Suggestion or advice
       </b>
       by a friend or relative, or one in confidential relation, is not undue influence, if it leaves the mind free to act on its own judgment. In re Beer's Estate, 190 Ore. 15, 222 P.2d 1005 (Or. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Determination of testator to give property to one who has assisted him is not evidence of insanity
       </b>
       but quite the contrary. In re Holland's Estate, 10 Alaska 557 (D. Alaska 1945) (decided under former law).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Influence arising from gratitude, affection, or esteem
       </b>
       is not undue, nor can it become such unless it destroys the free agency of the testator at the time the instrument is executed, and shows that the disposition which he attempted to make of his property therein results from the fraud, imposition, and restraint of the person whose superior will prompts the execution of the testament in the particular manner which the testator adopts. In re Turner's Will, 51 Ore. 1, 93 P. 461 (Or. 1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        When slight evidence of undue influence sufficient. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a will is unnatural in its terms and favors one who occupied a relationship of special confidence to the testator slight evidence of undue influence is sufficient to invalidate it. In re Walther's Estate, 177 Ore. 382, 163 P.2d 285 (Or. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        C.Old Age, Debility, and Sickness
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Test is integrity of mind not body. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither old age, sickness, nor extreme distress or debility of body incapacitate, provided the testator has possession of his mental faculties, and understands the business in which he is engaged.
   The test is the integrity of the mind, not the body. Chrisman v. Chrisman, 16 Ore. 127, 18 P. 6 (Or. 1888).
      </p>
      <p>
       Old age, and the ills of distress, debility, and sickness which often accompany it, do not incapacitate if the testator has possession of his faculties, and understands what he is doing, and such a condition may exist without perversion of the judgment. Chrisman v. Chrisman, 16 Ore. 127, 18 P. 6 (Or. 1888).
      </p>
      <p>
       Disease, great weakness, the use of alcohol and drugs and approaching death do not alone render a testator incompetent to make a will.
   The question is always whether, in spite of these things, he had sufficient mental capacity to understand the nature or extent of his property, the natural or proper objects of his bounty, and the nature of his testamentary act. In re Estate of Kraft, 374 P.2d 413 (Alaska 1962) (decided under former law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, if the testator was aware of the fact he was executing his will and that the witnesses were witnessing that act, then since the will had been read to him and he appeared to understand it, it was reasonable for the court to conclude that he also had an awareness of the fact that he was making a final disposition of all his property, and that he was dividing it between his wife and daughter who were the natural objects of his bounty. In re Estate of Kraft, 374 P.2d 413 (Alaska 1962) (decided under former law).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the testatrix sufficiently comprehended the nature of the business in which she was engaged, her testamentary capacity was not necessarily impaired merely by reason of her old age, debility and sickness. In re Walther's Estate, 177 Ore. 382, 163 P.2d 285 (Or. 1945).

      </p>

       The burden is on the proponent seeking the admission of a will to probate of proving that the will was executed by testator when he had the sound and disposing mind required by this section. Hayes v. First Nat'l Bank, 192 F.2d 393, 13 Alaska 499 (9th Cir. Alaska 1951) (decided under former law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The law lays upon those who claim that an insane person executed a will during a lucid interval of sanity the burden of establishing the asserted fact. In re Walther's Estate, 177 Ore. 382, 163 P.2d 285 (Or. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Testimony of subscribing witnesses,

        Essential elements. —

       Consciousness of the fact that the attesting signatures are being written is an indispensable element. In re Demaris' Estate, 166 Ore. 36, 110 P.2d 571 (Or. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is essential, not only that the signatures be genuine and that they be found upon an instrument which all three persons intended to sign, but also that the attesters signed in the testator’s presence. In re Demaris' Estate, 166 Ore. 36, 110 P.2d 571 (Or. 1941).

       <b>
        General rule as to attestation in presence of testator. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       When a testator has knowledge of the witness’s presence, and can, if he is so disposed, readily see them write their names, the will is attested in his presence, even if he does not see them do it, and could not without some slight physical exertion.
   It is not necessary that he should actually see the witnesses for them to be in his presence, if they are so near him that he is conscious of where they are and of what they are doing, through any of his senses, and are where he can readily see them if he is so disposed. In re Demaris' Estate, 166 Ore. 36, 110 P.2d 571 (Or. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement that the witnesses subscribe their names in the testator’s presence was met where the witnesses were in the same room with the testator when the will was executed by him and witnessed by them, and the testator knew what he was doing and knew that they were to act as witnesses to the execution of the will. In re Estate of Kraft, 374 P.2d 413 (Alaska 1962) (decided under former law).

        “In the testator’s presence”. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been much discussion by the courts of the meaning of the words “in the testator’s presence.” The reason for the rule is to obviate any opportunity of the witnesses committing a fraud upon the testator. In re Shaff's Estate, 125 Ore. 288, 266 P. 630 (Or. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Actual visible eyesight of the attesting witness is not always necessary
       </b>
       to constitute being in the “presence” of the testator. In re Shaff's Estate, 125 Ore. 288, 266 P. 630 (Or. 1928).

        As any of the senses may be employed. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Any of the senses that a testator possesses, which enable him to know whether another is near at hand and what he is doing, may be employed by him in determining whether the attesters are in his presence as they sign his will. In re Demaris' Estate, 166 Ore. 36, 110 P.2d 571 (Or. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Though blind, testator was, through his sense of hearing, conscious of the presence in the room of the two persons who were to act as witnesses to his will, and of the purpose for which they were there, and of what was being done there at that time by them in his behalf.
   Being conscious of what was being said and done at that time in reference to the execution of the will, and making no objection, the acts of the lawyer and the witnesses have the same effect in law as if done by his express request. In re Pickett's Will, 49 Ore. 127, 89 P. 377 (Or. 1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        It is not necessary that the witnesses should sign in the presence of each other.

      </p>

       <b>
        If the testator actually signs the will and the witnesses attest his signature at his request, it is sufficient,

       <b>
        The fact that the testatrix was assisted in affixing her signature to the will
       </b>
       by her attorney holding her hand and helping to guide the pen does not prevent the signature from being hers.
   She thereby clearly evinced her intention to sign the will. In re Heaverne's Estate, 118 Ore. 308, 246 P. 720 (Or. 1926).

        Attestation of a will by a witness was judicially admitted

       Where the testimony of all of the witnesses indicated that decedent was sober and that, so far as the witnesses could determine, not insane, an instrument submitted in a salesbook, with all of the writing of a testamentary nature embraced on 11 sales slips numbered consecutively, was admissible to probate as a valid holographic will.

        Will held not contingent. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where after stating, “and in case I die,” there suddenly came to the mind of the testator the thing which seemed to carry the most imminent threat of death (i. e., an operation) and he wrote it down just as it came up, in a disjointed way, there was nothing to indicate that he intended the will to stand if he died from an operation and not to stand if he died from any one of many other different causes.
   Hence, the will was not a contingent one and the probate court erred in so holding. In re Pearl's Estate, 11 Alaska 214 (D. Alaska 1946) (decided under former law).

       <b>
        Form of holographic will. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the requirement as to writing, date, and signature, a holographic will is subject to no other form. In re Lanart's Estate, 9 Alaska 535 (D. Alaska 1939), aff'd, 111 F.2d 88, 9 Alaska 670 (9th Cir. Alaska 1940) (decided under former law).
      </p>
      <p>
       A will entirely written, dated, and signed by the testator in his own handwriting, the testator being at the time qualified under law to make a will, being of sound mind, over 18 years old, and not acting under any fraud, duress or undue influence, and such instrument being duly proved as provided by law as the last will and testament of the deceased, was entitled to probate as such. In re Lanart's Estate, 9 Alaska 535 (D. Alaska 1939), aff'd, 111 F.2d 88, 9 Alaska 670 (9th Cir. Alaska 1940) (decided under former law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decedent's handwritten will was valid because the decedent's name in the exordium clause at the beginning of the holographic will, written totally in the decedent's handwriting, was a signature, and the decedent's will was complete when the instrument was admitted to formal probate. In re Estate of Baker, 386 P.3d 1228 (Alaska 2016).

       <b>
        Holographic wills should be liberally construed. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Holographic wills being made by the testator himself without the aid of experienced or professional help should, from their very nature, be more liberally construed than ones prepared by practical hands. In re Lanart's Estate, 9 Alaska 535 (D. Alaska 1939), aff'd, 111 F.2d 88, 9 Alaska 670 (9th Cir. Alaska 1940) (decided under former law).

      <p>
       It is not necessary in a holographic will that any testamentary or other technical words be employed. In re Lanart's Estate, 9 Alaska 535 (D. Alaska 1939), aff'd, 111 F.2d 88, 9 Alaska 670 (9th Cir. Alaska 1940) (decided under former law).

       A will in the handwriting of the testator does not require witnesses, as in the case of other wills, this formality being obviated by this section, which eliminates the necessity for witnesses to holographic wills. Lovskog v. Am. Nat, 111 F.2d 88, 9 Alaska 670 (9th Cir. Alaska 1940) (decided under former law).

      </p>
      <p>
       While the existence and content of an allegedly excuted lost will must be proven by clear and convincing evidence, if a will is traced to the possession of the testator and cannot be found after death, there is a rebuttable presumption that the testator destroyed the will or performed some other revocatory act on it. This presumption is not strong, and does not require clear and convincing evidence to rebut it. Dan v. Dan, 288 P.3d 480 (Alaska 2012).

       <b>
        “Forward” as equivalent of “give” or “bequeath”. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Use of the word “forward,” in the sense of “transmit,” seems as effective as “give” or “bequeath,” in a holographic will, to accomplish the purpose of a testator who was a humble watchman. Lovskog v. Am. Nat, 111 F.2d 88, 9 Alaska 670 (9th Cir. Alaska 1940) (decided under former law).

        Legislative intent to avoid manifest injustice. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Alaska Legislature tempered the broad reach of this section, the “slayer statute,” by investing trial courts with discretion to stay its application in those cases where manifest injustice would result; the legislature clearly decided that in such a case there should be discretion in the court to consider the specific facts of the homicide and, if denial of inheritance would be manifestly unjust, to permit it. The distinction between different slayers based on their personal wealth does not reflect the legislature’s purpose in enacting the manifest injustice provision. Blodgett v. Blodgett (In re Estate of Blodgett), 147 P.3d 702 (Alaska 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Application of slayer rule does not cause forfeiture,
       </b>
       because the offender did not own the property at the time of the homicide; he merely had an expectancy interest; by killing the decedent, the slayer prevents the property interest from vesting in himself. Blodgett v. Blodgett (In re Estate of Blodgett), 147 P.3d 702 (Alaska 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Application of this section to a son convicted of criminally negligent homicide of his father did not result in a “forfeiture of estate”; substantively, the law was clear that the “forfeiture of estate” clause was not implicated by the slayer rule, which does not prevent the slayer from inheriting in general, only from inheriting from the slayer’s victim. Blodgett v. Blodgett (In re Estate of Blodgett), 147 P.3d 702 (Alaska 2006).
      </p>

       <b>
        Operation of statute distinguished from attainder. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The slayer statute differs from the effect of attainder in that it generally results in the estate going to the other heirs, not to the government. Blodgett v. Blodgett (In re Estate of Blodgett), 147 P.3d 702 (Alaska 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Application of subsection (k) to criminally negligent homicide. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a criminally negligent homicide under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.11.html#t11c41a01s11.41.130" target="_blank">11.41.130</a></cite> is unintentional homicide, the effects of the “slayer statute,” under subsection (k) of this section, may be avoided if it is proved that applying that statute to one convicted of criminally negligent homicide results in manifest injustice. Blodgett v. Blodgett (In re Estate of Blodgett), 147 P.3d 702 (Alaska 2006).

        Determination of “manifest injustice.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme Court of Alaska has not had occasion to define the phrase “manifest injustice” as used in this section, or to set out the relevant factors that a trial judge should consider when ruling on this question. Blodgett v. Blodgett (In re Estate of Blodgett), 147 P.3d 702 (Alaska 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding “manifest injustice,” a judge must articulate specific circumstances that make the particular defendant significantly different from a typical offender within that category or that make the defendant’s conduct significantly different from a typical offense.

      The power of a person to leave property by will, and the rights of creditors, devisees, and heirs to the property are subject to the restrictions and limitations contained in AS 13.06 —
   AS 13.36 to facilitate the prompt settlement of estates. Upon the death of a person, that person’s real and personal property devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by the last will or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving lapse, renunciation, or other circumstances affecting the devolution of testate estates, or in the absence of testamentary disposition, to the heirs, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving renunciation or other circumstances affecting devolution of intestate estates, subject to homestead allowance, exempt property and family allowance, to rights of creditors, elective share of the surviving spouse, and to administration.

       In a probate case involving decedent wife’s estate, the superior court erred by finding that the husband’s unconscionable conduct warranted establishing a constructive trust to give the estate the husband’s statutory benefits. The husband was entitled to marital allowances and a share of the estate based solely on the existence of a valid marriage. Riddell v. Edwards, 76 P.3d 847 (Alaska 2003).

     <p>
      A proceeding to enforce a claim against the estate of a decedent or the decedent’s successors may not be revived or commenced before the appointment of a personal representative.
   After the appointment and until distribution, all proceedings and actions to enforce a claim against the estate are governed by the procedure prescribed by this chapter.
   After distribution a creditor whose claim has not been barred may recover from the distributees as provided in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c16a10s13.16.635" target="_self">13.16.635</a></cite> or from a former personal representative individually liable as provided in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c16a10s13.16.640" target="_self">13.16.640</a></cite>.
   This section has no application to a proceeding by a secured creditor of the decedent to enforce a right to the security except as to any deficiency judgment that might be sought in the proceeding.

      Persons interested in decedents’ estates may apply to the registrar for determination in the informal proceedings provided in this chapter, and may petition the court for orders in formal proceedings within the court’s jurisdiction including those described in this chapter. The court has exclusive jurisdiction of formal proceedings to determine how decedents’ estates subject to the laws of this state are to be administered, expended, and distributed. The court has concurrent jurisdiction of any other action or proceeding concerning a succession or to which an estate, through a personal representative, may be a party, including actions to determine title to property alleged to belong to the estate, and of any action or proceeding in which property distributed by a personal representative or its value is sought to be subjected to rights of creditors or successors of the decedent.

    Demand for notice of order or filing concerning decedent’s estate.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person desiring notice of any order or filing pertaining to a decedent’s estate in which the person has a financial or property interest, may file a demand for notice with the court at any time after the death of the decedent stating the name of the decedent, the nature of the demandant’s interest in the estate, and the demandant’s address or that of the demandant’s attorney.
   The clerk shall mail a copy of the demand to the personal representative if one has been appointed. After filing of a demand, no order or filing to which the demand relates shall be made or accepted without notice as prescribed in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c06a04s13.06.110" target="_self">13.06.110</a></cite> to the demandant or the demandant’s attorney. The validity of an order that is issued or a filing that is accepted without compliance with this requirement is not affected by the error, but the petitioner receiving the order or the person making the filing may be liable for any damage caused by the absence of notice.
   The requirement of notice arising from a demand under this provision may be waived in writing by the demandant and shall cease upon the termination of the demandant’s interest in the estate.

   Informal probate is conclusive as to all persons until superseded by an order in a formal testacy proceeding.
   No defect in the application or procedure relating to it that leads to informal probate of a will renders the probate void.

       A formal testacy proceeding is litigation to determine whether a decedent left a valid will.  A formal testacy proceeding may be commenced by an interested person filing a petition as described in AS 13.16.145(a) in which the person requests that the court, after notice and hearing, enter an order probating a will, or a petition to set aside an informal probate of a will or to prevent informal probate of a will that is the subject of a pending application, or a petition in accordance with AS 13.16.145(b) for an order that the decedent died intestate.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c16a04s13.16.140ol1b">
       A petition may seek formal probate of a will without regard to whether the same or a conflicting will has been informally probated.  A formal testacy proceeding may, but need not, involve a request for appointment of a personal representative.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c16a04s13.16.140ol1c">
       During the pendency of a formal testacy proceeding, the registrar shall not act upon any application for informal probate of any will of the decedent or any application for informal appointment of a personal representative of the decedent.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c16a04s13.16.140ol1d">
       Unless a petition in a formal testacy proceeding also requests confirmation of the previous informal appointment, a previously appointed personal representative, after receipt of notice of the commencement of a formal probate proceeding, must refrain from exercising the power to make any further distribution of the estate during the pendency of the formal proceeding.  A petitioner who seeks the appointment of a different personal representative in a formal proceeding also may request an order restraining the acting personal representative from exercising any of the personal representative’s powers of office and requesting the appointment of a special administrator. In the absence of a request, or if the request is denied, the commencement of a formal proceeding has no effect on the powers and duties of a previously appointed personal representative other than those relating to distribution.

      In contested cases, petitioners who seek to establish intestacy have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of death, venue, and heirship.
   Proponents of a will have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of due execution in all cases, and if they are also petitioners, prima facie proof of death and venue.
   Contestants of a will have the burden of establishing lack of testamentary intent or capacity, undue influence, fraud, duress, mistake, or revocation.
   Parties have the ultimate burden of persuasion as to matters with respect to which they have the initial burden of proof.
   If a will is opposed by the petition for probate of a later will revoking the former, it shall be determined first whether the later will is entitled to probate, and if a will is opposed by a petition for a declaration of intestacy, it shall be determined first whether the will is entitled to probate.

      Supervised administration is a single in rem proceeding to secure complete administration and settlement of a decedent’s estate under the continuing authority of the court which extends until entry of an order approving distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative or other order terminating the proceeding.
   A supervised personal representative is responsible to the court, as well as to the interested parties, and is subject to directions concerning the estate made by the court on its own motion or on the motion of any interested party. Except as otherwise provided in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c16a05s13.16.215" target="_self">13.16.215</a></cite>
   — <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c16a05s13.16.235" target="_self">13.16.235</a></cite>, or as otherwise ordered by the court, a supervised personal representative has the same duties and powers as a personal representative who is not supervised.

      A petition for supervised administration may be filed by any interested person or by a personal representative at any time or the prayer for supervised administration may be joined with a petition in a testacy or appointment proceeding.
   If the testacy of the decedent and the priority and qualification of any personal representative have not been adjudicated previously, the petition for supervised administration must include the matters required of a petition in a formal testacy proceeding and the notice requirements and procedures applicable to a formal testacy proceeding apply.
   If not previously adjudicated, the court shall adjudicate the testacy of the decedent and questions relating to the priority and qualifications of the personal representative in any case involving a request for supervised administration, even though the request for supervised administration may be denied. After notice to interested persons, the court shall order supervised administration of a decedent’s estate as follows:

The registrar shall determine that the bond is duly executed by a corporate surety, or one or more individual sureties whose performance is secured by pledge of personal property, mortgage on real property, or other adequate security. The registrar may permit the amount of the bond to be reduced by the value of assets of the estate deposited with a domestic financial institution, as defined in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c33a02s13.33.201" target="_self">13.33.201</a></cite>, in a manner that prevents their unauthorized disposition.

      Any person apparently having an interest in the estate worth in excess of $1,000, or any creditor having a claim in excess of $1,000, may make a written demand that a personal representative give bond.
   The demand must be filed with the registrar and a copy mailed to the personal representative, if appointment and qualification have occurred.
   Thereupon, bond is required, but the requirement ceases if the person demanding bond ceases to be interested in the estate, or if bond is excused as provided in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c16a06s13.16.255" target="_self">13.16.255</a></cite> or <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c16a06s13.16.260" target="_self">13.16.260</a></cite>. After receiving notice and until the filing of the bond or cessation of the requirement of bond, the personal representative shall refrain from exercising any powers of the personal representative’s office except as necessary to preserve the estate.
   Failure of the personal representative to meet a requirement of bond by giving suitable bond within 30 days after receipt of notice is cause for removal and appointment of a successor personal representative.

   If no request for new appointment is made within 30 days after expiration of time for appeal from the order in formal testacy proceedings, or from the informal probate, changing the assumption concerning testacy, the previously appointed personal representative upon request may be appointed personal representative under the subsequently probated will, or as in intestacy as the case may be.

   After appointment and qualification, a successor personal representative may be substituted in all actions and proceedings to which the former personal representative was a party, and no notice, process, or claim that was given or served upon the former personal representative need be given to or served upon the successor in order to preserve any position or right the person giving the notice or filing the claim may thereby have obtained or preserved with reference to the former personal representative.
   Except as otherwise ordered by the court, the successor personal representative has the powers and duties in respect to the continued administration that the former personal representative would have had if the appointment had not been terminated.

      The duties and powers of a personal representative commence upon appointment.
   The powers of a personal representative relate back in time to give acts by the person appointed that are beneficial to the estate occurring prior to appointment the same effect as those occurring thereafter.
   Prior to appointment, a person named executor in a will may carry out written instructions of the decedent relating to the decedent’s body, funeral, and burial arrangements.
   A personal representative may ratify and accept acts on behalf of the estate done by others where the acts would have been proper for a personal representative.

       A personal representative is a fiduciary who shall observe the standards of care applicable to trustees under AS 13.36.225 — 13.36.290. A personal representative is under a duty to settle and distribute the estate of the decedent in accordance with the terms of any probated and effective will and AS 13.06 — AS 13.36, and as expeditiously and efficiently as is consistent with the best interests of the estate. A personal representative shall use the authority conferred by AS 13.06 — AS 13.36, the terms of the will, if any, and any order in proceedings to which the personal representative is party for the best interests of successors to the estate.

       A personal representative may not be surcharged for acts of administration or distribution if the conduct in question was authorized at the time.  Subject to other obligations of administration, an informally probated will is authority to administer and distribute the estate according to its terms. An order of appointment of a personal representative, whether issued in informal or formal proceedings, is authority to distribute apparently intestate assets to the heirs of the decedent if, at the time of distribution, the personal representative is not aware of a pending testacy proceeding, a proceeding to vacate an order entered in an earlier testacy proceeding, a formal proceeding questioning the appointment or fitness to continue, or a supervised administration proceeding. Nothing in this section affects the duty of the personal representative to administer and distribute the estate in accordance with the rights of claimants, the surviving spouse, any minor and dependent children and any pretermitted child of the decedent as described elsewhere in AS 13.06  —  AS 13.36.

     <p>
      Not later than 30 days after appointment, every personal representative, except any special administrator, shall give information of the appointment to the heirs and devisees, including, if there has been no formal testacy proceeding and if the personal representative was appointed on the assumption that the decedent died intestate, the devisees in any will mentioned in the application for appointment of a personal representative. The information shall be delivered or sent by ordinary mail to each of the heirs and devisees whose address is reasonably available to the personal representative. The duty does not extend to require information to persons who have been adjudicated in a prior formal testacy proceeding to have no interest in the estate.
   The information must include the name and address of the personal representative, indicate that it is being sent to persons who have or may have some interest in the estate being administered, indicate whether bond has been filed, and describe the court where papers relating to the estate are on file.
   The personal representative’s failure to give this information is a breach of duty to the persons concerned but does not affect the validity of the appointment, the personal representative’s powers or other duties.
   A personal representative may inform other persons of the appointment by delivery or ordinary first-class mail.

    Improper exercise of power; breach of fiduciary duty.

     <p>
      If the exercise of power concerning the estate is improper, the personal representative is liable to interested persons for damage or loss resulting from breach of fiduciary duty to the same extent as a trustee of an express trust.
   The rights of purchasers and others dealing with a personal representative shall be determined as provided in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c16a07s13.16.400" target="_self">13.16.400</a></cite> and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c16a07s13.16.405" target="_self">13.16.405</a></cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       To impose liability based on this section, there must be findings that (1) there was an improper exercise of power, (2) there was “damage or loss” to the party to whom the personal representative is liable, and (3) this damage or loss resulted from a breach of a fiduciary duty.

    Persons dealing with personal representative; protection.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A person who in good faith either assists a personal representative or deals with the personal representative for value is protected as if the personal representative properly exercised the personal representative’s power.
   The fact that a person knowingly deals with a personal representative does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise.
   Except for restrictions on powers of supervised personal representatives which are endorsed on letters as provided in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c16a05s13.16.230" target="_self">13.16.230</a></cite>, no provision in any will or order of court purporting to limit the power of a personal representative is effective except as to persons with actual knowledge of it.
   A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to a personal representative.
   The protection here expressed extends to instances in which some procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters, including a case in which the alleged decedent is found to be alive.
   The protection here expressed is not by substitution for that provided by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.

    Compensation of personal representative.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A personal representative is entitled to reasonable compensation for services.
   If a will provides for compensation of the personal representative and there is no contract with the decedent regarding compensation, the personal representative may renounce the provision before qualifying and be entitled to reasonable compensation.
   A personal representative also may renounce the right to all or any part of the compensation.
   A written renunciation of fee may be filed with the court.

       There was no abuse of discretion in setting the personal representative’s rate of compensation at $20 per hour and allowing her to bill the estate for 1000 hours, where consideration was given to her lack of special expertise, the large number of hours spent without much to show for it, the poor job done in administering the estate, and the fact that the customary fee in the area was about $10-$20 per hour.

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In considering whether there are reasonably arguable grounds for a will contest, the court should examine what the personal representative knew or should have known about the merits of the claim as it proceeds: A personal representative could have reasonably arguable grounds to challenge a will but then learn through discovery that the claim lacks merit; reasonably arguable grounds may exist when an action is first filed but may dissipate as litigation proceeds.

      <p>
       This section encourages good faith will contests, in part to discover and make effective the intent of a decedent; denying a request for fees from a personal representative who acts in bad faith, implied by a lack of reasonably arguable grounds, does not “chill” this purpose. Where claims turn on disputed factual issues, this would require the representative to prevail at trial; with a pure question of law, which could be resolved on summary judgment, the reasonably-arguable-grounds inquiry would turn on whether there was a reasonable chance of prevailing at summary judgment. Enders v. Parker, 125 P.3d 1027 (Alaska 2005).

      Claims against a decedent’s estate may be presented as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t13c16a08s13.16.465ol11">
       the claimant may deliver or mail to the personal representative a written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount claimed, or may file a written statement of the claim, in the form prescribed by rule, with the clerk of the court; the claim is considered presented on receipt of the written statement of claim by the personal representative or on the filing of the claim with the court, whichever occurs first; if a claim is not yet due, the date when it will become due shall be stated; if the claim is contingent or unliquidated, the nature of the uncertainty shall be stated; if the claim is secured, the security shall be described; failure to describe correctly the security, the nature of any uncertainty, and the due date of a claim not yet due does not invalidate the presentation made;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c16a08s13.16.465ol12">
       the claimant may commence a proceeding against the personal representative in any court where the personal representative may be subjected to jurisdiction, to obtain payment of a claim against the estate, but the commencement of the proceeding must occur within the time limited for presenting the claim; no presentation of claim is required in regard to matters claimed in proceedings against the decedent that were pending at the time of death;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c16a08s13.16.465ol13">
       if a claim is presented under (1) of this section, no proceeding on it may be commenced more than 60 days after the personal representative has mailed a notice of disallowance; but, in the case of a claim that is not presently due or that is contingent or unliquidated, the personal representative may consent to an extension of the 60-day period, or to avoid injustice the court, on petition, may order an extension of the 60-day period, but in no event shall the extension run beyond the applicable statute of limitations.

       As to claims presented in the manner described in AS 13.16.465 within the time limit prescribed in AS 13.16.460, the personal representative may mail a notice to any claimant stating that the claim has been disallowed. If, after allowing or disallowing a claim, the personal representative changes a decision concerning the claim, the personal representative shall notify the claimant.  The personal representative may not change a disallowance of a claim after the time for the claimant to file a petition for allowance or to commence a proceeding on the claim has run and the claim has been barred.  Every claim that is disallowed in whole or in part by the personal representative is barred so far as not allowed unless the claimant files a petition for allowance in the court or commences a proceeding against the personal representative not later than 60 days after the mailing of the notice of disallowance or partial allowance if the notice warns the claimant of the impending bar.  Failure of the personal representative to mail to a claimant notice of action on a claim for 60 days after the time for original presentation of the claim has expired has the effect of a notice of allowance.

      </p>
      <p>
       Because the record failed to disclose exactly when the creditor served the prejudgment writ of attachment on the debtor, the appellate court could not determine whether the installment payments were attached before the decedent died, such that, whether the contractual right to payments from the debtor became property of the estate or not had to be determined on remand, to find out whether or not the writ of attachment was served before decedent died.

     <p>
      If any assets of the estate are encumbered by mortgage, pledge, lien, or other security interest, the personal representative may pay the encumbrance or any part of it, renew or extend any obligation secured by the encumbrance, or convey or transfer the assets to the creditor in satisfaction of a lien, in whole or in part, whether or not the holder of the encumbrance has presented a claim, if it appears to be for the best interest of the estate. Payment of an encumbrance does not increase the share of the distributee entitled to the encumbered assets unless the distributee is entitled to exoneration.

      If property distributed in kind or a security interest in it is acquired for value by a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who has received an instrument or deed of distribution from the personal representative, the purchaser or lender takes title free of rights of any interested person in the estate and incurs no personal liability to the estate, or to any interested person, whether or not the distribution was proper or supported by court order and whether or not the authority of the personal representative was terminated before execution of the instrument or deed. This section protects a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who, as personal representative, executed the deed of distribution, as well as a purchaser from or lender to any other distributee or transferee of a distributee. To be protected under this provision, a purchaser or lender need not inquire whether a personal representative acted properly in making the distribution in kind, even if the personal representative and the distributee are the same person, or whether the authority of the personal representative had terminated before the distribution. Any instrument described in this section that is recorded under AS 40.17 or filed under former AS 45.09 or under AS 45.29 and that bears a notation of that recordation or filing is prima facie evidence that the transfer described in it was made for value.

     <p>
      Subject to the rights of creditors and taxing authorities, competent successors may agree among themselves to alter the interests, shares, or amounts to which they are entitled under the will of the decedent, or under the laws of intestacy, in any way that they provide in a written contract executed by all who are affected by its provisions.
   The personal representative shall abide by the terms of the agreement subject to the obligation to administer the estate for the benefit of creditors, to pay all taxes and costs of administration, and to carry out the responsibilities of office for the benefit of any successors of the decedent who are not parties.
   Personal representatives of decedents’ estates are not required to see to the performance of trusts if the trustee thereof is another person who is willing to accept the trust. Accordingly, trustees of a testamentary trust are successors for the purposes of this section. Nothing in this section relieves trustees of any duties owed to beneficiaries of trusts.

       A personal representative acting in another state or a person required to pay the tax domiciled in another state may institute an action in the courts of this state and may recover a proportionate amount of the federal estate tax, of an estate tax payable to another state or of a death duty due by a decedent’s estate to another state, from a person interested in the estate who is either domiciled in this state or who owns property in this state subject to attachment or execution.  For the purposes of the action the determination of apportionment by the court having jurisdiction of the administration of the decedent’s estate in the other state is prima facie correct.

    Formal proceedings terminating testate administration; order construing will without adjudicating testacy.

     <p>
      A personal representative administering an estate under an informally probated will or any devisee under an informally probated will may petition for an order of settlement of the estate that will not adjudicate the testacy status of the decedent.
   The personal representative may petition at any time, and a devisee may petition after one year, from the appointment of the original personal representative, except that no petition under this section may be entertained until the time for presenting claims that arose before the death of the decedent has expired. The petition may request the court to consider the final account or compel or approve an accounting and distribution, to construe the will and adjudicate final settlement and distribution of the estate. After notice to all devisees and the personal representative and hearing, the court may enter an order or orders, on appropriate conditions, determining the persons entitled to distribution of the estate under the will, and, as circumstances require, approving settlement and directing or approving distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative from further claim or demand of any devisee who is a party to the proceeding and those the devisee represents.
   If it appears that a part of the estate is intestate, the proceedings shall be dismissed or amendments made to meet the provisions of AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c16a10s13.16.620" target="_self">13.16.620</a></cite>.

A distributee is not liable to claimants for amounts received as exempt property, homestead or family allowances, or for amounts in excess of the value of a distribution as of the time of distribution.

   Any distributee who fails to notify other distributees of the demand made upon the distributee by the claimant in sufficient time to permit them to join in any proceeding in which the claim was asserted against the distributee loses the right of contribution against other distributees.

     <p>
      If other property of the estate is discovered after an estate has been settled and the personal representative discharged or after one year after a closing statement has been filed, the court upon petition of any interested person and upon notice as it directs may appoint the same or a successor personal representative to administer the subsequently discovered estate.
   If a new appointment is made, unless the court orders otherwise, the provisions of AS 13.06
   — AS 13.36 apply as appropriate; but no claim previously barred may be asserted in the subsequent administration.

     <p>
      A compromise of any controversy as to admission to probate of any instrument offered for formal probate as the will of a decedent, the construction, validity, or effect of any governing instrument, the rights or interests in the estate of the decedent, of any successor, or the administration of the estate, if approved in a formal proceeding in the court for that purpose, is binding on all the parties to the compromise including those unborn, unascertained or who could not be located. An approved compromise is binding even though it may affect a trust or an inalienable interest. A compromise does not impair the rights of creditors or of taxing authorities who are not parties to it.

       Section 1, ch. 70, SLA 1972, provides: “Purpose.
   It is the purpose of this Act to implement the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (P.L. 92-203; 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) by amending state law to resolve those ambiguities, conflicts and problems directly or impliedly created by the enactment by Congress of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. It is also the purpose of this Act to complement through state policy, in a reasonable and fair manner, the federal policy expressed in that Act.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 8, ch. 70, SLA 1972, as amended by § 2, ch. 83, SLA 1973, provides: “To the extent of an inconsistency between a provision of this Act or AS 10.05 or AS 10.20 and a provision of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (P.L. 92-203; 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) or a provision in the articles of incorporation or bylaws required by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior under § 7(e) of the federal Act, the federal Act or the required provision in the articles or bylaws prevails with regard to a corporation organized under Alaska law pursuant to the federal Act.
   However, nothing in this section or elsewhere in this Act deprives a corporation organized pursuant to § 14(h)(2) or (3) of the federal Act of any benefit provided for in this Act to any other type of corporation organized under Alaska law pursuant to the federal Act.
   To the extent of an inconsistency between a provision of this Act and a provision of AS 10.05 or AS 10.20, this Act prevails with regard to a corporation organized under Alaska law pursuant to the federal Act.”

   A person who, before receiving actual notice of a pending local administration, has changed position in reliance upon the powers of a foreign personal representative is not prejudiced by reason of the application or petition for, or grant of, local administration.
   The local personal representative is subject to all duties and obligations that have accrued by virtue of the exercise of the powers by the foreign personal representative and may be substituted for the foreign personal representative in any action or proceedings in this state.

     <p>
      Any person under a duty to pay or deliver money or personal property to a minor may perform this duty, in amounts not exceeding $5,000 a year, by paying or delivering the money or property to (1) the minor, if the minor is married; (2) any person having the care and custody of the minor with whom the minor resides; (3) a guardian of the minor; or (4) a financial institution incident to a deposit in a federally insured savings account in the sole name of the minor and giving notice of the deposit to the minor. This section does not apply if the person making payment or delivery has actual knowledge that a conservator has been appointed or proceedings for appointment of a conservator of the estate of the minor are pending. The persons, other than the minor or any financial institution under (4) of this section, receiving money or property for a minor, are obligated to apply the money to the support and education of the minor, but may not pay themselves except by way of reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses for goods and services necessary for the minor’s support. Any excess sums shall be preserved for future support of the minor and any balance not so used and any property received for the minor must be turned over to the minor when the minor attains majority. Persons who pay or deliver in accordance with provisions of this section are not responsible for the proper application thereof.

       Although the Alaska Statutes do not appear to address the issue directly, it is doubtful that the legislature envisioned allowing an adoption battle among three sets of competing, would-be adoptive parents to be visited upon an orphaned infant with no neutral legal custodian to speak for her and protect her best interests.

    Testamentary appointment of guardian of minor.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The parent of a minor may appoint by will a guardian of an unmarried minor.
   Subject to the right of the minor under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c26a02s13.26.126" target="_self">13.26.126</a></cite>, a testamentary appointment becomes effective upon filing the guardian’s acceptance in the court in which the will is probated, if before acceptance, both parents are dead or the surviving parent is adjudged incapacitated. If both parents are dead, an effective appointment by the parent who died later has priority.
   This state recognizes a testamentary appointment effected by filing the guardian’s acceptance under a will probated in another state which is the testator’s domicile.
   Upon acceptance of appointment, written notice of acceptance must be given by the guardian to the minor and to the person having care of the minor, or to the minor’s nearest adult relation.

        The probate court is not bound to appoint the testamentary guardian under all conditions.
       </b>
       But the parent, having the right to appoint a testamentary guardian, should be denied that right only where it is made to appear to the court that the testamentary guardian is not of good moral character, or is otherwise incompetent to discharge the duties of guardian, or that the appointment of such a guardian would constitute an injustice to the wards and be prejudicial to them.

        Appointment of guardian without words of limitation. —

      <p>
       Where a person is appointed guardian without any words of limitation, it means guardian of the person and estate. In re Young's Estate, 9 Alaska 158 (D. Alaska 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where testatrix in her will appointed a certain person as “guardian of my children,” it was held that, considering the will in the light of the Alaska statutes, which over and over mention guardianship in the meaning that the guardian is guardian of both person and property of the minor, testatrix did not restrict the appointee to being guardian of the persons of her children.

        Duties of trustee and guardian of estate. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the deceased devised and bequeathed all of her estate, remaining after administration, to a trustee for her three children, in nowise conflicted with the appointment of another as guardian of the estates of two of the children. The estate of the children in the trust property is their right to receive their share of the net income until they become of age and to receive their share of the estate itself at that time. The duty of the guardian is to see to it that the trustee administers his duties correctly and that the wards get the net income, and that the same is properly expended and accounted for. In re Young's Estate, 9 Alaska 158 (D. Alaska 1937).

      A minor of 14 or more years may prevent an appointment of a testamentary guardian for the minor from becoming effective, or may cause a previously accepted appointment to terminate, by filing with the court in which the will is probated a written objection to the appointment before it is accepted or within 30 days after notice of its acceptance.
   An objection may be withdrawn.
   An objection does not preclude appointment by the court in a proper proceeding of the testamentary nominee, or any other suitable person.

Because the superior court found that the father was not an unfit parent and had not abandoned the child, it should not have found that all his parental rights of custody had been suspended by circumstances.

       Appointment of a guardian for children under 14 years old was not void on the ground that the court never acquired jurisdiction of the persons of the minors, where a written notice of the filing and hearing of the petition was given to the nearest relative of the minors, their grandmother, and she appeared in the proceeding and protested against the appointment and petitioned that she be appointed, and the minors appeared at the trial and were offered as witnesses on her behalf but were rejected by the judge.

      A guardian of a minor has the powers and responsibilities of a parent who has not been deprived of custody of a minor and unemancipated child, except that a guardian is not legally obligated to provide from the guardian’s own funds for the ward and is not liable to third persons by reason of the parental relationship for acts of the ward.

        A guardian is held to the exercise of prudence and sound discretion

       in investing his ward’s funds. Corcoran v. Kostrometinoff, 164 F. 685, 3 Alaska Fed. 225 (9th Cir. Alaska 1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       The guardian cannot be required to exercise superhuman power in foreseeing what will occur in the future.
   All that can be required of him is good faith and the exercise of diligence, care, and prudence in the performance of his duties. In re Guardianship of Corcoran, 3 Alaska 263 (D. Alaska 1907), rev'd, 164 F. 685, 3 Alaska Fed. 225 (9th Cir. Alaska 1908).

        But if he loans his ward’s money without security, he assumes the entire risk

      </p>
      <p>
       While a guardian is permitted to leave the funds of his ward temporarily on deposit in a reputable bank, pending investment or other disposition of the same, it is the decided weight of authority that he is personally chargeable with the loss of funds deposited with a bank for a fixed period of time upon a certificate of deposit.
   Such a transaction is a loan without security. Corcoran v. Kostrometinoff, 164 F. 685, 3 Alaska Fed. 225 (9th Cir. Alaska 1908).

       Where parental visitation rights are completely cut off, either legally or in practical effect, the parent is entitled to a court hearing where the state must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the order serves the children’s best interest; where a parent’s reasonable visitation rights are merely restricted, such as through appointment of a guardian who is to allow only restricted visitation, the parent is entitled to a court hearing where the state must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the restriction is in the child’s best interest.

       A guardian may invest trust funds, when it appears to be for the best interests of his trust and when he is duly authorized by the court to do so, outside of the jurisdiction in which he was appointed. In re Guardianship of Corcoran, 3 Alaska 263 (D. Alaska 1907), rev'd, 164 F. 685, 3 Alaska Fed. 225 (9th Cir. Alaska 1908).

       When the word “guardian” follows the name of the person acting in that capacity, he is deemed nonetheless a guardian because the word “as” has been omitted between his name and his title on a bank book.
   The word denoting representative capacity or character, not the conjunction, is the important word. In re Guardianship of Corcoran, 3 Alaska 263 (D. Alaska 1907), rev'd, 164 F. 685, 3 Alaska Fed. 225 (9th Cir. Alaska 1908).

      A guardian’s authority and responsibility terminate upon the death, resignation, or removal of the guardian or upon the minor’s death, adoption, marriage, or attainment of majority, but termination does not affect the guardian’s liability for prior acts, nor the obligation to account for funds and assets of the ward.
   Resignation of a guardian does not terminate the guardianship until it has been approved by the court.
   A testamentary appointment under an informally probated will terminates if the will is later denied probate in a formal proceeding.

       Superior court did not clearly err in concluding that termination of a mother’s parental rights was in the children’s best interest because it gave the possibility of a guardianship appropriate consideration; the superior court did not commit error by recognizing that guardianship procedures allow a guardianship to be more easily terminated than an adoption.

        Jurisdiction. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The jurisdiction of the court to appoint guardians for insane and incompetent persons is derived from the statute, and in order to obtain such jurisdiction it must affirmatively appear that the essential provisions of the statute are complied with. Martin v. White, 146 F. 461, 2 Alaska Fed. 586 (9th Cir. Alaska 1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       The matter of the appointment of a guardian for the person and estate of an insane person is peculiarly within the equitable jurisdiction of the court; it is a proceeding for his benefit and for the protection of his estate. White's Guardian v. Martin, 2 Alaska 471 (D. Alaska 1905).

        Evidence as to testamentary capacity. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Incompetency to make a will is not necessarily established by the fact that one has been adjudged an incompetent in a guardianship proceeding. But this fact is evidence to be considered, along with other evidence, on the issue of testamentary capacity. Paskvan v. Mesich, 455 P.2d 229 (Alaska 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       A decision of the issue as to testamentary capacity depended largely, if not entirely, on oral testimony given by witnesses seen and heard by the trial judge.
   It was his province to judge their credibility and the supreme court may not reverse his decision unless it finds it to be clearly erroneous. Paskvan v. Mesich, 455 P.2d 229 (Alaska 1969).

       <b>
        Prima facie case of testamentary capacity. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a witness stated under oath that the will was signed by decedent in her presence and the presence of one other subscribing witness, that decedent then declared that the instrument was his last will and testament and that at the time of execution of the will decedent was of sound and disposing mind and was not acting under duress, menace, fraud, undue influence or misrepresentation, there was evidence that established a prima facie case of testamentary capacity; the burden was then cast upon the contestants of the will to show that testamentary capacity was lacking. Paskvan v. Mesich, 455 P.2d 229 (Alaska 1969).

       Superior court’s grant of authority to permit a mentally ill adult to select where she wanted to live was a commendable effort by the court to respect her wishes in making that important choice, but it did not demonstrate that the superior court should have appointed only a partial guardian under this section.

       Superior court did not clearly err in finding that an elderly woman was incapacitated, and thus needed a partial public guardian, where a physician’s testimony that relied on hearsay was properly admitted under Alaska R. Evid. 703, and that testimony established that she was incapacitated and required assistance to manage her essential needs. Wilson v. State, 355 P.3d 549 (Alaska 2015).

The report must consider housing, medical care, and educational and vocational needs and resources. In developing the report, the guardian shall consult with the ward to the maximum extent possible. The report must specify the services that are necessary to meet the essential requirements for the ward’s physical health or safety and the means for obtaining the services. The report must specify the manner in which the guardian will exercise and share decision-making authority and other items that will assist in fulfilling the needs of the ward, the terms of the guardianship order, and the duties of the guardian.

       On petition of the ward, the guardian, or any person interested in the ward’s welfare, or on the court’s own motion, the court may (1) review and amend a decision of a guardian; or (2) if alternatives that are less restrictive than guardianship or less restrictive than the existing guardianship plan would assist the ward in meeting essential requirements for physical health and safety, modify the provisions of its order to (A) amend the guardianship plan or the responsibilities of the guardian; (B) remove a guardian and appoint a successor; or (C) terminate the guardianship. On petition of the guardian, the court may accept a resignation and make any other order that may be appropriate.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c26a03s13.26.286ol1b">
       The ward, the guardian, or any person interested in the ward’s welfare may petition for an order that the ward is no longer incapacitated or no longer incapacitated to the same extent as the ward was when the original guardianship order was made or when the court last amended the guardianship order, and for removal or resignation of the guardian, termination of the guardianship, or a change in the responsibilities of the guardian.  A request for this order may be made by informal letter to the court or judge and any person who knowingly interferes with transmission of this kind of request to the court or judge may be held in contempt of court.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c26a03s13.26.286ol1c">
       Before removing a guardian, changing the guardian’s responsibilities, accepting the resignation of a guardian, or ordering that a ward’s guardianship be changed or terminated, the court, following the same procedures to safeguard the rights of the ward as apply to a petition for appointment of a guardian and applying the least restrictive alternative necessary to meet the needs of the ward after consideration of alternatives to guardianship services, may send a visitor to the residence of the present guardian and to the place where the ward resides or is detained, to observe conditions and report in writing to the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c26a03s13.26.286ol1d">
       If at any time the ward requests or indicates to the guardian or to the agency responsible for the ward’s care or its employee that the ward desires a change in guardianship, the guardian or the agency providing care shall inform the court of the request or indication.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c26a03s13.26.286ol1e">
       If the guardian dies, or if on the basis of a petition filed under this section or a report or other information, there is probable cause to believe a guardian is not performing the guardian’s responsibilities effectively and there is an imminent danger that the physical health or safety of the ward will be seriously impaired, the court shall take whatever action is necessary to protect the ward, including the dismissal of the guardian and appointment of a temporary guardian without a hearing.

       This section deals with only some of the specific circumstances that might warrant removing a guardian and appointing a successor.

       Superior court did not abuse its discretion when it removed an adult child as the guardian for the child's parent, who suffered from epilepsy and was diagnosed with intellectual disability, because the adult child, by depriving the parent of personal care services and emergency services in favor of prayer, put the parent's health and safety at risk. Removing the adult child as guardian did not violate the Alaska Constitution's Free Exercise Clause because the State of Alaska possessed a compelling interest in preventing harm to the parent.

        Award of attorney fees properly denied. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly declined to award attorney fees to an elderly woman and her daughter who successfully opposed the state’s petition for guardianship; how the state’s conduct should be characterized was a question of fact for the superior court, and its finding that the state’s petition was not malicious, frivolous, or without just cause was not clearly erroneous.

       After the Office of Public Advocacy (OPA) unsuccessfully sought an elder fraud order of protection against a daughter, it was not error to deny the daughter an award of attorney’s fees against OPA in a related conservatorship proceeding because (1) the OPA did not initiate the proceeding, and (2)
   AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c26a05s13.26.680ol1c" target="_self">13.26.680(c)</a></cite> did not allow an award, as the statute was not a fee-shifting statute.

      <p>
       Insofar as Alaska R. Civ. P. 82 routinely awards fees in favor of the prevailing party, it should not be used in guardianship cases because doing so would interfere with the unique character and purpose of guardianship proceedings; however, to the extent that Rule 82 permits award of up to full reasonable attorney fees for vexatious or bad faith conduct or for cases that are malicious, frivolous, or brought without just cause, utilization of the rule does not interfere with the unique character of guardianship proceedings.

      <p>
       Court did not err by failing to appoint an uncle to serve as guardian or conservator because his inability to act as representative payee for social security payments would pose a serious threat to the niece’s financial well-being; the uncle’s statements to the court visitor and during the guardianship hearing raised significant concerns about his ability to provide for the niece’s needs, particularly in relation to maintaining a stable residence for her.

      <p>
       A public guardian was the most appropriate guardian for a developmentally disabled adult woman; while guardianship by parents has a higher priority, the court has discretion to make the appointment which is in the best interest of the incapacitated person. Here there was good cause for such an appointment based upon the parents’ failure to help their daughter maintain extended family relationships or to take advantage of an array of services to help her with vocational and life skills.

        Sterilization of mental incompetents. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A superior court, as a court of general jurisdiction, does have, as part of its inherent parens patriae authority, the power to entertain and act upon a petition seeking an order authorizing the sterilization of a mental incompetent. C.D.M. v. State, 627 P.2d 607 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before sanctioning the sterilization of an incompetent, the court must take great care to ensure that the incompetent’s rights are zealously guarded. C.D.M. v. State, 627 P.2d 607 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The advocates of a proposed operation to sterilize an incompetent bear the heavy burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that sterilization is in the best interests of the incompetent. C.D.M. v. State, 627 P.2d 607 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The proponents of the sterilization of a mental incompetent must show that there is no less restrictive alternative to the proposed operation. C.D.M. v. State, 627 P.2d 607 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Basic notions of procedural due process require that before an order for the sterilization of a mental incompetent is entered the incompetent be afforded a full judicial hearing at which medical testimony is presented and the incompetent, through a guardian ad litem, is allowed to present proof and cross-examine witnesses. C.D.M. v. State, 627 P.2d 607 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before an order for the sterilization of a mental incompetent is entered the court must assure itself that a comprehensive medical, psychological, and social evaluation is made of the incompetent.
   If it is necessary in meeting this standard that independent advice be obtained then the court should, on its own motion, obtain such advice. C.D.M. v. State, 627 P.2d 607 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before an order for the sterilization of a mental incompetent is entered the court must first determine that the individual legally is incompetent to make her own decision whether or not to be sterilized and that this incapacity is in all likelihood permanent.
   It must then be established that the incompetent is capable of reproduction and that, as a result of her disability, she would be unable to adequately care and provide for her offspring. Next, it must be shown that sterilization is the only practicable means of contraception.
   To the extent possible, the court must also elicit testimony from the incompetent concerning her understanding and desire for the proposed operation and its consequences.
   Finally, the court must examine closely the motivation behind the petition. C.D.M. v. State, 627 P.2d 607 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The guidelines set forth in this opinion for determining the procedure to be taken on a petition for an order to sterilize a mental incompetent are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the various factors which the superior court should consider before ruling on a petition for sterilization. Rather, they set forth what are to be the minimum inquiries necessary to protect the constitutional rights of the incompetent. C.D.M. v. State, 627 P.2d 607 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the individual’s status as an “incapacitated person” prevents her expressed desires from being conclusive, this does not mean that her apparent preferences can be totally ignored. C.D.M. v. State, 627 P.2d 607 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon the hearing of a petition for the sterilization of a mental incompetent, the incompetent’s apparent preferences should be treated much the same as those of a child in a custody hearing. C.D.M. v. State, 627 P.2d 607 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The weight to be accorded to an incompetent’s preferences concerning a petition for her sterilization will depend upon the degree to which she appears to understand the purpose and significance of sterilization. C.D.M. v. State, 627 P.2d 607 (Alaska 1981).

        Assessment of need for conservatorship. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since a special conservatorship cannot be reconciled with a requirement that a conservatorship candidate be found wholly incapable of making any rational decision, the need for a conservator must be assessed in the context of the person’s incapacity and the specific matters for which management or protection may be required. In re S.H., 987 P.2d 735 (Alaska 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where doctors provided considerable evidence of a conservatorship candidate’s inability to make litigation decisions, even assuming mental illness did not describe his condition, the incapacity documented to the superior court satisfied the statute, and the court did not commit clear error in accepting the evidence as clear and convincing proof of the candidate’s inability to manage his property and affairs effectively. In re S.H., 987 P.2d 735 (Alaska 1999).

   AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c26a04s13.26.401" target="_self">13.26.401</a></cite>(2)(A) and (B), where substantial evidence demonstrated the father’s inability to prioritize his finances, and other evidence, including the father’s own testimony, reinforced the daughter’s evidence that the father was in need of a conservator; the evidence presented supported the finding that the father abused alcohol and his capacity to perform routine activities could be relevant in evaluating whether appointment of a conservator was appropriate.

       Superior court did not clearly err in finding that the woman was unable to manage her property and affairs, and thus needed a public conservator, where the evidence showed that she could not return to her home unless her family lived with her and paid rent, her family would not cooperate with her personal care assistants, and she was required to sell her home in order to remain in the assisted living facility.

        Assessment of need for conservatorship. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since a special conservatorship cannot be reconciled with a requirement that a conservatorship candidate be found wholly incapable of making any rational decision, the need for a conservator must be assessed in the context of the person’s incapacity and the specific matters for which management or protection may be required. In re S.H., 987 P.2d 735 (Alaska 1999).

       If, during the pendency of an initial petition for conservatorship, it appears that the respondent is in need of a protective order to protect the respondent against waste or dissipation of funds or property, or to obtain funds that are needed for the immediate support, care, and welfare of the respondent or persons entitled to be supported by the respondent, and the respondent is not capable of protecting the respondent’s funds or property or obtaining the funds that are needed to support the respondent or persons whom the respondent is required to support, the petitioner may request the appointment of a temporary conservator to authorize the protection or to obtain the necessary funds. The request must state the reasons and factual basis for the request. The petitioner shall immediately file the request with the court and serve copies on the respondent and the respondent’s attorney and other persons as ordered by the court. The court shall appoint an attorney for a respondent who is unrepresented to be at the hearing and conduct a hearing within 72 hours after the filing.

If the court finds that the petition establishes probable cause that the respondent is financially defrauding the petitioner or a person for whose benefit the petitioner filed the petition and that, because of the fraud, there has been or is an immediate threat of a waste or dissipation of the proposed protected person’s funds or other property, the court shall ex parte and without notice to the respondent issue a protective order.

       Court did not err by determining that an uncle was unqualified to serve as guardian or conservator because his inability to act as representative payee for social security payments would pose a serious threat to the niece’s financial well-being; the uncle’s statements to the court visitor and during the guardianship hearing raised significant concerns about his ability to provide for the niece’s needs, particularly in relation to maintaining a stable residence for her.

       The court may require a conservator to furnish a bond conditioned upon faithful discharge of all duties of the trust according to law, with sureties as it shall specify.  Unless otherwise directed, the bond shall be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the property of the estate in the conservator’s control plus one year’s estimated income minus the value of securities deposited under arrangements requiring an order of the court for their removal and the value of any land which the fiduciary, by express limitation of power, lacks power to sell or convey without court authorization. The court in place of sureties on a bond, may accept other security for the performance of the bond, including a pledge of securities or a mortgage of land.

      <p>
       Since, where the purpose of the conservatorship is to protect the client’s property, it is logical that normally the cost of that conservatorship be charged against the estate thus preserved, the court erred in imposing the costs on the client’s law firm.

       In a dispute over conservator’s final accounting of expenses, the conservator’s attorney’s fees should have been evaluated under
   AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c26a04s13.26.485" target="_self">13.26.485</a></cite>, not Alaska R. Civ. P. 82’s prevailing party standard. Because the conservator’s performance was inadequate, and may have caused damage to estate, the superior court was directed to deduct from the conservator’s reimbursed fees those that it incurred in defending actions that caused significant harm to the estate.

      A conservator shall submit a report to the court at least every year.

On termination of the protected person’s minority or disability, a conservator may account to the court or to the former protected person or the protected person’s personal representative. Subject to appeal or vacation within the time permitted, an order, made upon notice and hearing, allowing an intermediate account of a conservator, adjudicates as to the conservator’s liabilities concerning the matters considered in connection with it; and an order, made upon notice and hearing, allowing a final account, adjudicates as to all previously unsettled liabilities of the conservator to the protected person or the protected person’s successors relating to the conservatorship. In connection with any account, the court may require a conservator to submit to a physical check of the estate in the conservator’s control, to be made in any manner the court may specify.

      The appointment of a conservator vests in the conservator title as trustee to all property of the protected person, presently held or thereafter acquired, including title to any property theretofore held for the protected person by custodians or attorneys-in-fact.
   The appointment of a conservator is not a transfer or alienation within the meaning of general provisions of any federal or state statute or regulation, insurance policy, pension plan, contract, will or trust instrument, imposing restrictions upon or penalties for transfer or alienation by the protected person of any rights or interest, but this section does not restrict the ability of persons to make specific provision by contract or dispositive instrument relating to a conservator.

      Letters of conservatorship are evidence of transfer of all assets of a protected person to the conservator.
   An order terminating a conservatorship is evidence of transfer of all assets of the estate from the conservator to the protected person, or the protected person’s successors. Subject to the requirements of general statutes governing the recordation of documents of title to land or other property, letters of conservatorship, and orders terminating conservatorships, may be recorded to give record notice of title as between the conservator and the protected person.

    Persons dealing with conservators; protection.

     <p>
      A person who in good faith either assists a conservator or deals with the conservator for value in any transaction other than those requiring a court order as provided in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c26a04s13.26.435" target="_self">13.26.435</a></cite>, is protected as if the conservator properly exercised the power. The fact that a person knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise, except that restrictions on powers of conservators which are endorsed on letters as provided in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c26a04s13.26.550" target="_self">13.26.550</a></cite> are effective as to third persons.
   A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to a conservator.
   The protection here expressed extends to instances in which some procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters.
   The protection here expressed is not by substitution for that provided by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.

       A conservator may expend or distribute income or principal of the estate without court authorization or confirmation for the support, education, care, or benefit of the protected person and the protected person’s dependents in accordance with the following principles:
       <ol>
        <li id="t13c26a04s13.26.545ol1a1">
         the conservator is to consider recommendations relating to the appropriate standard of support, education, and benefit for the protected person made by a parent or guardian, if any; the conservator may not be surcharged for sums paid to persons or organizations actually furnishing support, education, or care to the protected person pursuant to the recommendations of a parent or guardian of the protected person unless the conservator knows that the parent or guardian is deriving personal financial benefit therefrom, including relief from any personal duty of support, or unless the recommendations are clearly not in the best interests of the protected person;

        <li id="t13c26a04s13.26.545ol1a2">
         the conservator is to expend or distribute sums reasonably necessary for the support, education, care, or benefit of the protected person with due regard to
         <ol type="A">
          <li id="t13c26a04s13.26.545ol1a2A">
           the size of the estate, the probable duration of the conservatorship, and the likelihood that the protected person, at some future time, may be fully able to manage the protected person’s affairs and the estate which has been conserved;
          </li>
          <li id="t13c26a04s13.26.545ol1a2B">

        </li>
        <li id="t13c26a04s13.26.545ol1a3">
         the conservator may expend funds of the estate for the support of persons legally dependent on the protected person and others who are members of the protected person’s household who are unable to support themselves and who are in need of support;
        </li>
        <li id="t13c26a04s13.26.545ol1a4">
         funds expended under this subsection may be paid by the conservator to any person, including the protected person to reimburse for expenditures which the conservator might have made, or in advance for services to be rendered to the protected person when it is reasonable to expect that they will be performed and where advance payments are customary or reasonably necessary under the circumstances.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t13c26a04s13.26.545ol1b">
       If the estate is ample to provide for the purposes implicit in the distributions authorized by (a) of this section, a conservator for a protected person other than a minor has power to make gifts to charity and other objects as the protected person might have been expected to make, in amounts which do not exceed in total for any year 20 percent of the income from the estate.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c26a04s13.26.545ol1c">
       When a minor who has not been adjudged disabled under AS 13.26.401(2) attains majority, the conservator, after meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds and properties to the former protected person as soon as possible.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c26a04s13.26.545ol1d">
       When the conservator is satisfied that a protected person’s disability (other than minority) has ceased, the conservator, after meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds and properties to the formerly protected person as soon as possible.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c26a04s13.26.545ol1e">
       If a protected person dies, the conservator shall deliver to the court for safekeeping any will of the deceased protected person that may have come into the conservator’s possession and inform the executor or a beneficiary named in the will that the will has been so delivered. Once a conservator knows that the protected person has died, the conservator may not exercise authority over the protected person’s affairs and estate except to pay reasonable burial expenses and to preserve, account for, and transfer control of assets to a personal representative, a temporary property custodian appointed by the court, or a person authorized to take custody of personal property by affidavit under AS 13.16.680. If, after 40 days from the death of the protected person, no other person has been appointed personal representative and no application or petition for appointment is before the court, the conservator may apply to exercise the powers and duties of a personal representative in order to proceed with administering and distributing the decedent’s estate without additional or further appointment. Upon application for an order granting the powers of a personal representative to a conservator, after notice to any person demanding notice under AS 13.16.070 and to any person nominated executor in any will of which the applicant is aware, the court may order the conferral of the power upon determining that there is no objection, and endorse the letters of the conservator to note that the formerly protected person is deceased and that the conservator has acquired all of the powers and duties of a personal representative. The making and entry of an order under this section has the effect of an order of appointment of a personal representative as provided in AS 13.16.115 and 13.16.245 — 13.16.655 except that estate in the name of the conservator, after administration, may be distributed to the decedent’s successors without prior retransfer to the conservator as personal representative.

      <li id="t13c26a04s13.26.560ol1a">
       Subject to AS 13.26.545(e), a conservator shall pay from the estate all just claims against the estate and against the protected person arising before or after the conservatorship was established upon their presentation and allowance. A claim is considered presented on the first to occur of receipt of the written statement of claim by the conservator or the filing of the claim with the court. A presented claim is allowed if it is not disallowed by written statement mailed by the conservator to the claimant within 60 days after its presentation. The presentation of a claim tolls any statute of limitations relating to the claim until 30 days after its disallowance. A claim may be presented by either of the following methods:
       <ol>
        <li id="t13c26a04s13.26.560ol1a1">
         the claimant may deliver or mail to the conservator a written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount claimed;

        <li id="t13c26a04s13.26.560ol1a2">
         the claimant may file a written statement of the claim, in the form prescribed by rule, with the clerk of the court and deliver or mail a copy of the statement to the conservator.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t13c26a04s13.26.560ol1b">
       A claimant whose claim has not been paid may petition the court for determination of the claim at any time before it is barred by the applicable statute of limitation, and, upon due proof, procure an order for its allowance and payment from the estate.  If a proceeding is pending against a protected person at the time of appointment of a conservator or is initiated against the protected person thereafter, the moving party must give notice of the proceeding to the conservator if the outcome is to constitute a claim against the estate.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c26a04s13.26.560ol1c">
       If it appears that the estate in a conservatorship is likely to be exhausted before all existing claims are paid, preference is to be given to prior claims for the care, maintenance, and education of the protected person or the protected person’s dependents and existing claims for expenses of administration.

     <p>
      The protected person, the protected person’s personal representative, the conservator, or any other interested person may petition the court to terminate the conservatorship.
   A protected person seeking termination is entitled to the same rights and procedures as in an original proceeding for a protective order.
   The court, upon determining after notice and hearing that the minority or disability of the protected person has ceased, may terminate the conservatorship.
   Upon termination, title to assets of the estate passes to the former protected person or to the person’s successors subject to provision in the order for expenses of administration or to conveyances from the conservator to the former protected person or the person’s successors, to evidence the transfer.

      <p>
       An agent authorized to act for a principal under a statutory form power of attorney may not bring suit as a pro se litigant in the principal’s stead. The unlicensed, in-court representation of another is considered “engaging in the practice of law” and is thus prohibited by Alaska’s statute proscribing the unlicensed “practice of law” (AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.08.html#t08c08a04s08.08.210ol1a" target="_blank">08.08.210(a)</a></cite>).

      The legislature recognizes that many Alaskans, for reasons of incapacity or minority, are in need of a guardian or conservator.
   Often these persons cannot find a person able and willing to serve as guardian or conservator.
   The legislature intends through AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c26a06s13.26.700" target="_self">13.26.700</a></cite> — <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c26a06s13.26.750" target="_self">13.26.750</a></cite> to establish the function of public guardian for the purpose of furnishing guardianship and conservatorship services.
   It further intends by establishing this function to provide assistance to guardians throughout the state in securing necessary services for their wards and to assist the courts, attorneys, visitors, respondents, and proposed guardians in the orderly and expeditious handling of guardianship proceedings.

       This section does not limit the Alaska Office of Public Advocacy’s appointment to only those cases in which no other qualified person exists. Appointment of the office is appropriate where there are serious concerns as to the appointment of a technically “qualified” person. In re Protective Proceedings of M.K., 278 P.3d 876 (Alaska 2012).

       Superior court properly granted partial summary judgment and awarded attorney's fees to the Office of Public Advocacy (OPA) in an action for class certification, declaratory judgment and injunctive relief filed by an incapacitated individual (the ward) on his behalf by a next friend because, while it was error to hold the next friend personally liable for fees, OPA was not delegating its duties, but was instead contracting for "services necessary to carry out" its statutory duties, and the public policy behind having its wards' conditions monitored as frequently as possible supported allowing OPA to contract with service providers to help fulfill its duty to perform quarterly visits.

A POD designation in a multiple-party account without right of survivorship is ineffective. For purposes of this section, designation of an account as a tenancy in common establishes that the account is without right of survivorship.

The surviving party or beneficiary, or the decedent’s estate, is liable to the payee of an unpaid request for payment. The liability is limited to a proportionate share of the amount transferred under this section to the extent necessary to discharge the request for payment.

      On death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners. On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survived the death of all owners. Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common. If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.

      Registration shall be accomplished by filing a statement indicating the name and address of the trustee in which it acknowledges the trusteeship. The statement shall indicate whether the trust has been registered elsewhere. The statement shall identify the trust: (1) in the case of a testamentary trust, by the name of the testator and the date and place of domiciliary probate; (2) in the case of a written inter vivos trust, by the name of each settlor and the original trustee and the date of the trust instrument; or (3) in the case of an oral trust, by information identifying the settlor or other source of funds and describing the time and manner of the trust’s creation and the terms of the trust, including the subject matter, beneficiaries and time of performance.
   If a trust has been registered elsewhere, registration in this state is ineffective until either the earlier registration is released by order of the court where prior registration occurred or an instrument executed by the trustee and all beneficiaries is filed with the registration in this state.

In addition, any trustee who, within 30 days after receipt of a written demand by a settlor or beneficiary of the trust, fails to register a trust as required by AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c36a01s13.36.005" target="_self">13.36.005</a></cite> — <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c36a01s13.36.025" target="_self">13.36.025</a></cite> is subject to removal under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c36a03s13.36.076" target="_self">13.36.076</a></cite> and denial of compensation or to surcharge as the court may direct.

       On petition of an interested person, after notice to all interested persons, the court may review the propriety of employment of any person by a trustee including any attorney, auditor, investment advisor or other specialized agent or assistant, and the reasonableness of the compensation of any person so employed, and the reasonableness of the compensation determined by the trustee for the trustee’s services.  Any person who has received excessive compensation from a trust may be ordered to make appropriate refunds.

       If the terms of a trust do not specify the compensation or method for determining the compensation of the trustee, the trustee is entitled to compensation that is reasonable under the circumstances. If the terms of a trust do not specify the compensation or method for determining the compensation of a person employed by the trustee, the person employed by the trustee is entitled to compensation that is reasonable under the circumstances. If the terms of a trust specify the compensation or method for determining the compensation of a trustee and if the trustee is compensated according to these terms, the compensation paid to the trustee is presumed to be reasonable. If the terms of a trust specify the compensation or method for determining the compensation of a person employed by the trustee and if the person employed by the trustee is compensated according to these terms, the compensation paid to the person employed by the trustee is presumed to be reasonable. If a trust specifies the compensation or method for determining the compensation paid to the trustee or person employed by the trustee and if the trustee or person employed by the trustee is compensated accordingly, an interested person who seeks review of the compensation has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the compensation paid to the trustee or the person employed by the trustee is not reasonable.

       Because this section expressly authorizes a surcharge claim and does not require bad faith on the part of the trustee opposing the beneficiary’s petition for substitution of the trustee, the trial court erred in denying the beneficiary’s surcharge claim without considering whether the fees charged to the trust for opposing the substitution petition were excessive; the only criteria expressed in this section are reasonableness and excessiveness; therefore a trustee which was paid excessive fees could be ordered to repay them.

If bond is required, it shall be filed in the court of registration or other appropriate court in amounts and with sureties and liabilities as provided in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c16a06s13.16.260" target="_self">13.16.260</a></cite> and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c16a06s13.16.270" target="_self">13.16.270</a></cite> relating to bonds of personal representatives.

      A trustee is under a continuing duty to administer the trust at a place appropriate to the purposes of the trust and to its sound, efficient management. If the principal place of administration becomes inappropriate for any reason, the court may enter any order furthering efficient administration and the interests of beneficiaries, including, if appropriate, release of registration, removal of the trustee under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t13c36a03s13.36.076" target="_self">13.36.076</a></cite>, and appointment of a trustee in another state.

       An exercise of the power to invade trust principal under AS 13.36.157 is the exercise of a special power of appointment.

       The appointed trust to which an authorized trustee appoints the assets of the invaded trust under AS 13.36.157 may have a duration that is longer than the duration set out in the invaded trust.

       If an authorized trustee has unlimited discretion to invade the principal of a trust and if the same trustee or another trustee has a power, not dependent on unlimited discretion, to invade principal under the trust instrument, the authorized trustee having unlimited discretion may exercise the power of appointment under AS 13.36.157(a) — (c).
      </li>
      <li id="t13c36a03s13.36.158ol1d">
       An authorized trustee may exercise the power to appoint in favor of an appointed trust under AS 13.36.157 whether or not there is a current need to invade principal under the terms of the invaded trust.

      <li id="t13c36a03s13.36.158ol1e">
       An authorized trustee exercising the power under AS 13.36.157 — 13.36.159 has a fiduciary duty to exercise the power in the best interests of one or more proper objects of the exercise of the power and as a prudent person would exercise the power under the prevailing circumstances. The authorized trustee may not exercise the power under AS 13.36.157 — 13.36.159 if there is substantial evidence of a contrary intent of the settlor and it cannot be established that the settlor would be likely to have changed this intention under the circumstances existing at the time the trustee exercises the power. The provisions of the invaded trust may not be viewed alone as substantial evidence of a contrary intent of the settlor unless the invaded trust expressly prohibits the exercise of the power in the manner intended by the authorized trustee.
      </li>

       The provisions of AS 13.36.157 — 13.36.159 may not be construed to abridge the right of a trustee to appoint property further in trust under the terms of the governing instrument of a trust, another provision of law, or common law, or as directed by a court having jurisdiction over the trust.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c36a03s13.36.158ol1g">
       Nothing in AS 13.36.157 — 13.36.159 creates or implies a duty to exercise a power to invade principal. An inference of impropriety may not be made, and liability is not incurred, as a result of an authorized trustee not exercising the power conferred under AS 13.36.157.

       A power authorized by AS 13.36.157 may be exercised, subject to the provisions of AS 13.36.159(a), unless expressly prohibited by the terms of the governing instrument. A general prohibition against amending or revoking the invaded trust and a provision that constitutes a spendthrift clause do not preclude the exercise of a power under AS 13.36.157.

The form has no effect unless it is acknowledged and recorded before your death. How do I make a TOD deed? Yes. Is the “legal description” of the property necessary? This information may be on the deed you received when you became an owner of the property. This information may also be available in the office of the recorder in the recording district where the property is located. If you are not absolutely sure, consult a lawyer. How do I find the “legal description” of the property? Yes. If you have not yet recorded the deed and want to change your mind, simply tear up or otherwise destroy the deed. Can I change my mind before I record the TOD deed? Take the completed and acknowledged form to the office of the recorder in the recording district where the property is located. Follow the instructions given by the recorder to make the form part of the official property records. If the property is in more than one recording district, you should record the deed in each recording district. How do I “record” the TOD deed? Yes. You can revoke the TOD deed. Except for a court, no one, including the beneficiaries, can prevent you from revoking the deed. Can I later revoke the TOD deed if I change my mind? There are three ways to revoke a recorded TOD deed: (1) Complete and acknowledge a revocation form, and record it in each recording district where the property is located. (2) Complete and acknowledge a new TOD deed that disposes of the same property, and record it in each recording district where the property is located. (3) Transfer the property to someone else during your lifetime by a recorded deed that expressly revokes the TOD deed. You may not revoke the TOD deed by will. How do I revoke the TOD deed after it is recorded? Do not complete this form under pressure. Seek help from a trusted family member, friend, or lawyer. I am being pressured to complete this form. What should I do? No, but it is recommended. Secrecy can cause later complications and might make it easier for others to commit fraud. Do I need to tell the beneficiaries about the TOD deed? This form is designed to fit some but not all situations. If you have other questions, you are encouraged to consult a lawyer. I have other questions about this form. What should I do?

      ADVANCE HEALTH CARE DIRECTIVE Explanation You have the right to give instructions about your own health care to the extent allowed by law. You also have the right to name someone else to make health care decisions for you to the extent allowed by law. This form lets you do either or both of these things. It also lets you express your wishes regarding the designation of your health care provider. If you use this form, you may complete or modify all or any part of it. You are free to use a different form if the form complies with the requirements of . AS 13.52 Part 1 of this form is a durable power of attorney for health care. A “durable power of attorney for health care” means the designation of an agent to make health care decisions for you. Part 1 lets you name another individual as an agent to make health care decisions for you if you do not have the capacity to make your own decisions or if you want someone else to make those decisions for you now even though you still have the capacity to make those decisions. You may name an alternate agent to act for you if your first choice is not willing, able, or reasonably available to make decisions for you. Unless related to you, your agent may not be an owner, operator, or employee of a health care institution where you are receiving care. Unless the form you sign limits the authority of your agent, your agent may make all health care decisions for you that you could legally make for yourself.

You should talk to the person you have named as your agent to make sure that the person understands your wishes and is willing to take the responsibility. You have the right to revoke this advance health care directive or replace this form at any time, except that you may not revoke this declaration when you are determined not to be competent by a court, by two physicians, at least one of whom shall be a psychiatrist, or by both a physician and a professional mental health clinician.

       INTRODUCTION. I, , want to have one or more persons I trust help me make decisions, obtain and understand the information I need to make my decisions, and tell other people about my decisions. The people who will help me are my “supporters.” I can name three supporters in this form. If I want to have more than three supporters, I can use a form that is substantially similar to this form to enter into a supported decision-making agreement with the additional supporters. This is a written agreement between me (“principal”) and each of my supporters. I can say in this agreement what kind of help each of my supporters will give me. A SUPPORTER APPOINTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT MAKE DECISIONS FOR ME. My supporters may share information with each other (select one of the following): Yes [ ] No [ ] (2) SUPPORTERS. These are my supporters: SUPPORTER NO. 1 Name: Address: Telephone number: Electronic mail address: I want this supporter to help me with (mark any of the following you want): [ ] Making choices about food and clothing [ ] Making choices about where and with whom I live [ ] Making choices about my health and health care [ ] Making choices about how I spend my time [ ] Making choices about where I work [ ] Making choices about my support services [ ] Making choices about how I spend my money and how I save my money [ ] Making choices about legal matters [ ] Making choices about (list other areas the supporter will help you with): I do not want this supporter to help me with: SUPPORTER NO. 2 Name: Address: Telephone number: Electronic mail address: I want this supporter to help me with (mark any of the following you want): [ ] Making choices about food and clothing [ ] Making choices about where and with whom I live [ ] Making choices about my health and health care [ ] Making choices about how I spend my time [ ] Making choices about where I work [ ] Making choices about my support services [ ] Making choices about how I spend my money and how I save my money [ ] Making choices about legal matters [ ] Making choices about (list other areas the supporter will help you with): I do not want this supporter to help me with: SUPPORTER NO. 3 Name: Address: Telephone number: Electronic mail address: I want this supporter to help me with (mark any of the following you want): [ ] Making choices about food and clothing [ ] Making choices about where and with whom I live [ ] Making choices about my health and health care [ ] Making choices about how I spend my time [ ] Making choices about where I work [ ] Making choices about my support services [ ] Making choices about how I spend my money and how I save my money [ ] Making choices about legal matters [ ] Making choices about (list other areas the supporter will help you with): I do not want this supporter to help me with: ALTERNATE SUPPORTER.
