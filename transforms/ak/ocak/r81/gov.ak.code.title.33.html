       Superior court erred in revoking defendant's probation because there was insufficient evidence to support his probation violation for failing to provide a urine sample at the request of a probation officer; the State failed to present any evidence that the staff at the correctional center told him that the test had been requested by a probation officer and that refusing to submit to the test would constitute a violation of his probation.

        Mandatory parole,

      <p>
       Inmate alleged that he was not aware that after two years of imprisonment he would be released and would serve the remainder of his six year sentence on mandatory parole; the inmate established a prima facie case that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, about the nature of the sentence he would receive if he entered into the plea bargain, and that he would not have entered into the plea bargain had he received accurate advice regarding mandatory parole.

       Alaska Parole Board was authorized to set special conditions of mandatory parole, based on the statutes enacted in 1960, when defendant committed his offenses in 1979 and 1984; the enactment of a new parole statute in 1985 did not increase his punishment and the special conditions imposed were inherent in the criminal judgments imposed by the sentencing courts in 1979 and 1984.

        Ex post facto claim.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In an appeal that involved an ex post facto challenge to the special medical parole statute, the appellate court concluded that the expansion of the statutory exclusion in 2003 simply returned appellant to the position he was in at the time he committed his 1984 offense, before special medical parole was enacted. Because the exclusion did not constitute additional punishment for appellant's underlying crime, the appellate court rejected appellant's ex post facto claim.

      </p>
      <p>
       The wording, “an order suspending the imposition of sentence for a given length of time, and requiring, as a special condition of probation, a definite term of imprisonment to be served periodically,” is necessary to ensure that a prisoner given periodic time receives appropriate “good time” credit, so that his parole eligibility is properly computed. Whittlesey v. State, 626 P.2d 1066 (Alaska 1980).

      <p>
       Superior court properly sentenced defendant to 30 years to serve for first-degree sexual abuse of his minor stepdaughter because he had a criminal history—he had physically and sexually abused his biological sister—he was not eligible for good time deductions where he was sentenced for an unclassified sexual felony, and he was not eligible for discretionary parole.

        Challenge to legislative policy. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Judge failed to provide any case-specific reasons for his conclusion that a restriction on discretionary parole was required or for his generalized assumptions about when criminal defendants typically "age out," instead improperly voicing his disagreement with the legislative policy decisions underlying the provisions of this section.
       Thomas v. State, 413 P.3d 1207 (Alaska Ct. App. 2018).

       <b>
        “Presumptive” term and parole. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Judge’s decision to label defendant’s term of imprisonment “presumptive” had no effect on his eligibility for discretionary parole, where parole eligibility was set by statute. Reyes v. State, 978 P.2d 635 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       As negotiated, defendant received an eight-year sentence for second-degree assault and kidnapping; trial court erred in labeling a portion of defendant’s sentence as “presumptive” because this was both legally incorrect and, potentially, a cause of future confusion. Different provisions of this section govern the parole eligibility of prisoners who are subject to presumptive sentencing. Heavyrunner v. State, 172 P.3d 819 (Alaska Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no direct relationship between whether a defendant’s sentence is a “presumptive sentence” and whether he is eligible to apply for discretionary parole while serving the sentence. Luckart v. State, 314 P.3d 1226 (Alaska Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statewide three-judge panel has the authority to grant enhanced parole eligibility to defendants who are subject to presumptive sentencing, but sentencing judges have no discretion when it comes to categorizing a defendant’s sentence as “presumptive” or “non-presumptive”; rather, this classification of sentences is governed by statute. Luckart v. State, 314 P.3d 1226 (Alaska Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in failing to consider whether the prohibition on discretionary parole would result in manifest injustice after it imposed a sentenced of 15 years with 9 years suspended for second-degree sexual abuse of a minor, and the three-judge sentencing panel had statutory authority to grant enhanced parole eligibility to defendants who were subject to presumptive sentencing. Lochridge v. State (Alaska Ct. App. June 8, 2016) (memorandum decision).

       A presumptively sentenced prison who is mandatorily released with 180 days or less remaining on his sentence cannot be released unconditionally. State v. Frazier, 719 P.2d 261 (Alaska 1986).

       <b>
        Fifty year parole restriction improper. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court’s order that defendant’s eligibility for discretionary parole be restricted until he had served at least 50 years of his sentence was reversed as excessive because defendant was ineligible for parole for 33 years, when he would be 67 years old. The trial court’s decision to additionally restrict defendant’s eligibility for discretionary parole was based on predictions that defendant would be dangerous to the public and might constitute a danger to his then middle-aged children and their children which was a speculative possibility at best. Korkow v. State, 258 P.3d 932 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011), rev'd, 314 P.3d 560 (Alaska 2013).

        Cruel and unusual punishment.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case in which defendant received a sentence of 70 years' imprisonment (with normal eligibility for parole) for a murder that he committed when he was a juvenile, the appellate court concluded that defendant's sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment because defendant failed to prove that he would inevitably spend his entire life in prison.

       District court lacked jurisdiction to decide challenges to the state parole board’s interpretation of this section and to the constitutionality of parole statutes, as interpreted. Such challenges had to be brought in the superior court. Bishop v. Municipality of Anchorage, 685 P.2d 103 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984), decided under former AS 33.15.180.

        “Presumptive” term and parole. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Judge’s decision to label defendant’s term of imprisonment “presumptive” had no effect on his eligibility for discretionary parole, where parole eligibility was set by statute. Reyes v. State, 978 P.2d 635 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).

        Restricting parole eligibility. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Twenty-year parole restriction, applied to the entire period of a twenty-year sentence, was clearly mistaken, since such an implied distrust of the parole board’s ability to do its job was unwarranted in the absence of express findings, supported by specific evidence, establishing a need to restrict parole eligibility. Newell v. State, 771 P.2d 873 (Alaska Ct. App. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Restrictions on parole eligibility must rest on a finding that normal parole eligibility would be insufficient to protect the public and insure the defendant’s reformation. Cheely v. State, 861 P.2d 1168 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Parole board did not abuse its discretion when it refused to remove the precondition for parole on defendant's completion of a substance abuse evaluation and any recommended treatment because there was nothing in the record to suggest that the parole board was aware that the precondition could not be met at the time it was imposed, and nothing to suggest that the precondition could not be met in the future once defendant was released from protective custody. Starkey v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Apr. 29, 2020).

       Deduction of good time under this section was inapplicable in calculating whether a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment had been served for purposes of determining discretionary parole eligibility. Hampel v. State, 911 P.2d 517 (Alaska Ct. App. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Trial court is not required to advise of parole minimums,

       or of its authority to fix parole eligibility, under the terms of Cr. R. 11; but it is preferable for the court to inform the defendant.

        Section inapplicable to mandatory parolee.
       </b>
       Mandatory parolees are not denied equal protection of the laws because they are not permitted to appear before the parole board prior to their release while discretionary parolees are granted the right of an in-person appearance; the purpose of the parole hearing under this section is to allow the discretionary parolee an opportunity to persuade the board for release on parole whereas the mandatory parolee must be released on parole at the end of the parolee’s sentence less time deducted for good conduct. Accordingly, there is nothing for the board to consider with regard to whether a mandatory parolee should be released. Smith v. State Dep't of Cors., 872 P.2d 1218 (Alaska 1994).

       Where defendant’s sentences were to be served consecutively to a sentence then being served for a parole revocation on an earlier offense, the trial court order, that the defendant receive no credit for time served since his arrest, was proper in view of the court’s action in making the sentences consecutive to the time to be served on the parole revocation, for the time served from defendant’s arrest should properly have been credited toward the parole revocation sentence.

       Superior court properly granted summary judgment to the State and rejected defendant’s request for retroactive application of the parole earned-compliance credits statute because the parole earned compliance credits program only applied to time spent on parole after its effective date of January 1, 2017, the ambiguous applicability clause governing the parole earned-compliance credits program appeared more the product of inartful drafting than a specific intent to treat the probation and parole programs differently, the earned-compliance credits program was designed to incentivize good behavior, and it would be difficult to award earned-compliance credits for past compliance.

      <p>
       The wording, “an order suspending the imposition of sentence for a given length of time, and requiring, as a special condition of probation, a definite term of imprisonment to be served periodically,” is necessary to ensure that a prisoner given periodic time receives appropriate “good time” credit, and so that his parole eligibility is properly computed.

        Applicability of good-time deduction. —

       Deduction of good time under this section was inapplicable in calculating whether a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment had been served for purposes of determining discretionary parole eligibility. Hampel v. State, 911 P.2d 517 (Alaska Ct. App. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although amendments to subsection (a) were added to preclude a defendant from accruing good time credits where substantial physical torture was inflicted upon a murder victim, those amendments were enacted after defendant’s sentencing and, thus, were not applicable to defendant. Malloy v. State, 153 P.3d 1003 (Alaska Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendants were not entitled to good time credit for time spent in a halfway house as a condition of probation because, while parolees were entitled to such credit, probation is an act of grace and clemency, intended as a more lenient alternative to imposition of a statutory penalty for a crime, while mandatory parole is an established variation on imprisonment, so a prisoner released on mandatory parole is still technically a prisoner serving a sentence of imprisonment. George v. State, 307 P.3d 4 (Alaska Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly sentenced defendant to 30 years to serve for first-degree sexual abuse of his minor stepdaughter because he had a criminal history—he had physically and sexually abused his biological sister—he was not eligible for good time deductions where he was sentenced for an unclassified sexual felony, and he was not eligible for discretionary parole.

      <p>
       Post-conviction relief was properly granted in a case where appellee inmate was seeking good time credit based on his stay in a halfway house run by a contractor because the definition of “correctional facility” is not limited to state-run facilities, and there is no discretion to withhold credit unless there is a showing of a violation of the rules of the correctional facility;

       Although the settlement agreement between the state of Alaska and a group of state prisoners, that set forth population control measures in prisons to remain in effect until emergency overcrowding legislation was enacted, only regulated conditions in correctional facilities owned or operated by the state and did not directly cover Alaska inmates incarcerated at the Central Arizona Detention Center; the settlement agreement empowered the superior court to require compliance at the Arizona facility as a condition of approving the state’s plan to reduce prison overcrowding.

       The Alaska Department of Corrections retains authority over all significant decisions involving Alaska inmates housed at the Central Arizona Detention Center, and the state did not waive jurisdiction over defendant by sending him to the Arizona facility.

      <p>
       Although defendant committed his crime before subsection (a) was amended to permit the Department of Corrections to contract with private out-of-state prisons, applying the law to defendant did not violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws, because subsection (a) did not punish defendant for an act previously committed, nor make the punishment for his crime more burdensome, nor deprive him of any defense that was available when he killed his victim. The fact that a statute alters a convicted person’s circumstances to his or her disadvantage does not show an ex post facto violation. Hertz v. State, 22 P.3d 895 (Alaska Ct. App. 2001).

        Proceedings to terminate parental rights. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where imprisoned father’s credibility was not central to the trial court’s decision-making process in termination proceeding, and the burden on the state’s interests of a rule requiring prisoner transports in all termination proceedings would be substantial, this section did not require an incarcerated father to be transported to proceeding to determine the termination of parental rights. Financial costs to the state were high, the administrative burden on the Department of Corrections increased by the frequent need to transfer prisoners out to make room for incoming prisoners or face legal action for overcrowding, and significant planning and coordination will often be necessary to accomplish such transfers, and in this case the father gave little notice to the Department of Corrections of his request to attend the trial in person. Richard B. v. State, 71 P.3d 811 (Alaska 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       In making a determination to grant a prisoner’s request to testify in person in a civil trial in which the prisoner is a party, Alaska trial court’s may take into account the costs and inconvenience of transporting a prisoner from his place of incarceration to the courtroom, any potential danger or security risk which the presence of a particular inmate would pose to the court, the substantiality of the matter at issue, the need for an early determination of the matter, the possibility of delaying trial until the prisoner is released, the probability of success on the merits, the integrity of the correctional system, and the interests of the inmate in presenting his testimony in person rather than by deposition. These factors are among those a trial court should consider in deciding whether to grant an incarcerated parent’s request to be transported to a termination trial under subsection (f). Richard B. v. State, 71 P.3d 811 (Alaska 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no deprivation of due process when the trial court denied an incarcerated father’s motion for transport so the father could attend his parental rights termination trial where the father participated telephonically the first four days of trial, personally attended the last two days, and testified in person. Any possible error in applying this section was harmless. Seth D. v. State, 175 P.3d 1222 (Alaska 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not abuse its discretion by denying a prisoner's request for transport to attend in person the prisoner's parental rights termination trial because the court considered all relevant factors that the parties presented to the court, because it was not obvious that considering additional factors in the case law would have changed the court's statutory analysis, and because the prisoner's due process rights were not violated.

       Superior court erred in directing the Department of Public Safety to transport defendant from the correctional center where he was currently housed to another correctional center to facilitate a psychological evaluation by a psychologist retained by defendant's attorneys because the court had no authority to do so without violating the doctrine of separation of powers and the defense attorneys' claim of "cost-effectiveness" was purely a relative one inasmuch as they made no attempt to show that it would be objectively more cost-effective for all involved and they did not even provide any estimate of the relative costs.

       Alaska prerelease furlough laws providing for imposition of conditions for granting furloughs do not facially violate an inmate’s right to due process under the Alaska Constitution. There was no showing that the inmate was denied fair consideration or that the conditions were imposed for an improper purpose. Hertz v. Macomber, 297 P.3d 150 (Alaska 2013).

       Furlough condition laws were not ex post facto punishment, nor did the laws trigger double jeopardy, because enacting the furlough statute after an inmate was sentenced was more favorable to the inmate than prior law, and a furlough is not punishment.

       Inmate's appeal of a finding of possessing contraband was properly dismissed because the inmate's statement of points on appeal was insufficient, as (1) a statement that the State violated the inmate's fundamental constitutional rights to due process and thereby prejudiced the inmate's right to a fair adjudication alleged no supporting facts, and (2) a claim that alleged violations were ascertainable from the record and decisional documents attached to a notice of appeal shifted to the trial judge the burden of identifying appealable issues, contrary to the statute.

      <b>
       THE AGREEMENT ON DETAINERS.
      </b>
      Article I
     </p>
     <p>
      The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of those charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints.
      The party states also find that proceedings with reference to charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures.
      It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide those cooperative procedures.

        Primary function of agreement. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant was not denied due process of law under the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1, § 7 of the Alaska Constitution because the state did not supplement its extradition proceedings with a specific request for return of the defendant under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, for the primary function of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers is to give the defendant a means, if he wishes to exercise it, of compelling the state to return him for retrial. Conway v. State, 707 P.2d 930 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).

        Filing detainer without first seeking extradition. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(d)(6) requires the state to exercise diligence and to make reasonable efforts to obtain the presence of the defendant for trial in order to avoid dismissal, but there is nothing in the language of Rule 45 that would preclude the state from initially relying on the interstate Agreement on Detainers as a means of exercising diligence and reasonable efforts; the agreement fully protects the defendant’s right to a speedy trial, and a requirement that the state first seek extradition before filing a detainer would serve no useful purpose. Miller v. State, 739 P.2d 1303 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).

        Prisoner’s burden regarding filing of request. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A prisoner need only transmit the written notice and request for final disposition to the appropriate custodial officials in order to fulfill completely his responsibility under the agreement. However, while the filing of a request with the proper custodial authorities is sufficient to fulfill the prisoner’s responsibility, the defendant has the burden of proving that such a proper request was filed. Newcomb v. State, 779 P.2d 1240 (Alaska Ct. App. 1989).

        Effect of dismissed escape charges on extradition request. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       That Virginia filed a detainer pursuant to this section, but later dismissed the charge of escape against defendant, did not affect the validity of Virginia’s later extradition request which included a copy of the sentence imposed for the defendant’s Virginia felony charges, a statement that he failed to complete the sentences because he escaped, and a copy of the arrest warrant based on the escape charge. Kelly v. State, 803 P.2d 876 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).

      </p>
      <p>
       Although defendant argued that a trial judge should have granted his motion to dismiss because the State violated the Interstate Agreement on Detainers by filing an untimely detainer, defendant did not demonstrate that the judge erred when she decided that the State had not violated the Agreement.

        ARTICLE I PURPOSE AND POLICY
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The compacting states to this Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized in accordance with the by-laws and rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the purpose of this compact and the Interstate Commission created under this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states, to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, this compact will create an Interstate Commission that will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections, or other criminal justice agencies that will adopt rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct non-compliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in that activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The compacting states recognize that there is no right of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and by-laws and rules adopted under the compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created in this compact are the formation of public policies and are, as a result, public business.

Each state council shall appoint as its commissioner the compact administrator from that state, to serve on the Interstate Commission in that capacity under or in accordance with applicable law of the member state.
