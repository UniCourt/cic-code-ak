     </h3>
     <p>
      This constitution is dedicated to the principles that all persons have a natural right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and the enjoyment of the rewards of their own industry; that all persons are equal and entitled to equal rights, opportunities, and protection under the law; and that all persons have corresponding obligations to the people and to the State.

      The Board of Fish and Game may provide for area licensing under the provisions of the state constitution. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 28.
     </p>
     <p>
      Following
      <i>
       State v. Erickson
      </i>
      , 574 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1978), equal protection claims under the Alaska Constitution are measured under a new test which evaluates the importance of the right involved. The more important the right, the greater the burden placed on the state to show that the classification has a fair and substantial relation to a legitimate governmental objective. April 25, 1979 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The analysis for equal protection claims involves three steps: (1) Ascertaining the purposes of the challenged legislation and determining whether they are legitimate; (2) determining whether the means chosen to accomplish the objectives actually do so; and (3) balancing the importance of the state’s interest in the means chosen against the nature of the right allegedly infringed. April 25, 1979 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      While there clearly are legal challenges which can be mounted to a three-year residence requirement for a grant of state land, a vigorous defense of such a requirement can be made. April 25, 1979 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Even if the Alaska supreme court views the right to change one’s residence from another state to Alaska as a fundamental right under the Alaska Constitution, this does not mean that a three-year residence requirement for land disposal necessarily violates that fundamental right. To violate the right of interstate migration, it would have to appear that the durational residence requirement in some way penalized the exercise of that right, and a strong argument can be made that conferring eligibility for a grant of state land after three years residence rewards people exercising their right to move to Alaska rather than penalizing them for exercising it. April 25, 1979 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The basic requirement is that the three-year durational residence requirement have some reasonable basis; that is, that it bear a fair and substantial relation to some legitimate legislative purpose. The more extensive the legislative findings regarding the purpose of such a requirement and the reasons for it, the greater the likelihood that it would be sustained. April 25, 1979 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation cannot constitutionally cease making funds available to mortgage companies that are not headquartered in the state. December 26, 1979 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      A five-year durational residency requirement for eligibility to participate in a state program is clearly unconstitutional and cannot be defended in the absence of a compelling state interest. November 26, 1982 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Five-year residency requirements provided for in the subparagraphs of AS

      as it existed prior to the 1985 amendment were unconstitutional, since the state’s interest in ensuring that only bona fide resident commercial fishermen qualify for the commercial fishing loan program did not outweigh the infringement on the right of less-than-five-year residents to share in the economic benefits of the program. November 26, 1982 Op. Att’y Gen.

        The United States of America, and Alaska in particular, reflect a pluralistic society, grounded upon such basic values as the preservation of maximum individual choice, protection of minority sentiments, and appreciation for divergent lifestyles. Breese v. Smith, 501 P.2d 159 (Alaska 1972).

        The Alaska supreme court is free, and it is under a duty, to develop additional constitutional rights and privileges under the Alaska Constitution if it finds such fundamental rights and privileges to be within the intention and spirit of Alaska’s local constitutional language and to be necessary for the kind of civilized life and ordered liberty which is at the core of Alaska’s constitutional heritage. The Alaska supreme court need not stand by idly and passively waiting for constitutional direction from the highest court of the land. Instead, it should be moving concurrently to develop and expound the principles embedded in Alaska constitutional law. State v. Browder, 486 P.2d 925 (Alaska 1971).

        The guarantee of equal treatment under the law contained in the federal and state constitutions is the embodiment of the fundamental principle that all men are equal before the law.

       <p>
        Analysis of equal protection claims under the federal constitution is, if anything, more forgiving than the approach that the Supreme Court of Alaska uses under the Equal Rights Clause of the Alaska Constitution; thus, where an ordinance, which exempted from taxation the first $10,000 of residential property used as the owner’s permanent place of residence, did not violate the state Equal Rights Clause, the federal Equal Protection Clause was also not violated.

         Laws making unjust distinctions. —

       </p>
       <p>
        This section is a prohibition against laws which, in their application, make unjust distinctions between persons. Leege v. Martin, 379 P.2d 447 (Alaska 1963); In re Brewer, 430 P.2d 150 (Alaska 1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        The guarantee of equality of treatment prohibits legislation which denies to one group of persons the enjoyment of certain rights which are afforded to another group, when, considering the purpose of the legislation, there is no reasonable basis for not treating both groups the same. Leege v. Martin, 379 P.2d 447 (Alaska 1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirements of equal protection amount to a prohibition of laws which, in their application, make unjust distinctions between persons. If a rational basis for a classification is reasonably apparent, there is no denial of equal protection. It is elementary that the power to define crimes and fix punishments rests in the legislature. In the performance of that function, that body is to use the discretion lodged in it, and not be confined by narrow or unduly restrictive limits. The supreme court cannot say that a legislative judgment was unreasonable if it bears a rational connection to a legitimate public purpose. So long as a legislative classification is not based upon an arbitrary or unjustifiable distinction and does not invidiously discriminate between two groups, there is no denial of equal protection. Alex v. State, 484 P.2d 677 (Alaska 1971).

       </p>

        Equal protection, even under Alaska’s stricter standard, does not demand perfection in classification. Commercial Fisheries Entry Comm'n v. Apokedak, 606 P.2d 1255 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Equal protection does not mean that the entire field of governmental action be covered by one legislative enactment. Suber v. Alaska State Bond Comm., 414 P.2d 546 (Alaska 1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Equal protection means only that a rational basis for a classification reasonably may be conceived. Suber v. Alaska State Bond Comm., 414 P.2d 546 (Alaska 1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because equal protection does not require the state to treat all individuals the same as it treats itself, the Alaska Victims’ Rights Act of 1991 is not vulnerable to a constitutional attack under Alaska’s equal protection clause. State v. Murtagh, 169 P.3d 602 (Alaska 2007).

       <p>
        In cases involving federal constitutional questions, where fundamental rights and suspect categories are at issue, the supreme court is bound by the “compelling state interest” standard unless that test is altered by the United States supreme court. In applying the Alaska Constitution, however, there is no reason why it cannot use a single test. State v. Erickson, 574 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court applies a single test which is nevertheless flexible and dependent upon the importance of the rights involved. Based on the nature of the right, a greater or lesser burden is placed on the state to show that the classification has a fair and substantial relation to a legitimate governmental objective.

        In order for a classification to be valid under Alaska’s equal protection test, it must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must bear a fair and substantial relation to a legitimate governmental objective, and depending on the importance of the individual’s interest involved, a greater or lesser burden will be placed on the state to show this fair and substantial relationship.

        Department of Natural Resources did not deny equal protection by compelling commercial landowners who constructed wharves to enter into lease agreements while imposing no similar requirement upon private landowners. Riparian landowners using state land to construct wharves for private use are not similarly situated to those using state land to construct wharves for commercial use, and the legislature expressed an intention that the DNR maximize the return on the leasing of state land.

         Inquiry in equal protection claims. —

       <p>
        The inquiry in claims that equal protection has been denied is whether there has been a deliberate and intentional plan to discriminate based on some unjustifiable or arbitrary classification. North Slope Borough v. Puget Sound Tug &amp; Barge, 598 P.2d 924 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court must assess equal protection claims under the Alaska Constitution by considering the purpose of the statute, the legitimacy of that purpose, the means used to accomplish the legislative objective, and then determine whether the means chosen substantially further the goals of the enactment. It must also balance the state interest in the chosen means against the nature of the constitutional right which is at issue. Plas v. State, 598 P.2d 966 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Regarding equal protection challenges under the state constitution, the supreme court must initially look to the purpose of the statute, viewing the legislation as a whole, and the circumstances surrounding it. It must be determined that this purpose is legitimate, that it falls within the police power of the state. Examining the means used to accomplish the legislative objectives and the reasons advanced therefore, the court must then determine whether the means chosen substantially further the goals of the enactment. Finally, the state interest in the chosen means must be balanced against the nature of the constitutional right involved. Commercial Fisheries Entry Comm'n v. Apokedak, 606 P.2d 1255 (Alaska 1980).

         State v. Erickson
        </i>
        , 574 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1978), approach to state equal protection analysis is essentially one of balancing. On the one hand, the court must assess (1) the legitimacy of the state purpose purportedly furthered by the provision, and (2) the extent to which the relationship between the end (the asserted purpose) and the means (the classification chosen) is fair and substantial. On the other hand, the court is to determine the nature and the extent of the infringement of individual rights allegedly caused by the classification. Then the balance is struck.

While off-road communities receive fewer certified police officers, they are not situated similarly to the on-road communities; trooper allocation statutes and regulations are facially race-neutral and there is no intent to discriminate.

       </p>
       <p>
        Under former AS 11.30.090, it was a felony for a felon to escape, while it was a misdemeanor for a misdemeanant to escape. This did not amount to an unconstitutionally arbitrary discrimination which bears no reasonable relation to the circumstances of the escape itself. Alex v. State, 484 P.2d 677 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under former AS 11.30.090, the crime of escape was divided into two classes on the basis of the felony or misdemeanor classification of the crime for which a person was initially incarcerated. All those within each class were subject to identical treatment. Under each class the punishment to be received was not arbitrarily or mandatorily fixed. Rather, the sentencing judge was given a range of discretion to be used in dealing with each offender. Alex v. State, 484 P.2d 677 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was true that under former AS 11.30.090 the character and nature of an escape were not necessarily the basis upon which the crime is defined and the punishment fixed. However, the nature and method of an escape might well be considered by the judge when he exercised his discretion under the sentencing provisions. Moreover, there was no constitutional necessity for the designation of the crime and the extent of the punishment to be based solely or even in part on the nature of the escape. Alex v.

       </p>
       <p>
        There is ample, respectable scientific evidence of harm or potential harm from the use of cocaine to sustain the legislature’s inclusion of cocaine in its classification of narcotics under the provisions of former AS 17.10 [see now AS 11.71 and AS 17.30], rather than AS 17.12. Thus, the legislative goal is legitimate, and the classification at issue is substantially related to that goal. State v. Erickson, 574 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature specifically intended to regulate the use and possession of cocaine, regardless of its particular pharmacological status, and the purpose of former AS 17.10 is to regulate drugs that have a potential for harm to health and welfare. State v. Erickson, 574 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1978).

        Provisions of the local option law do not violate equal protection merely because they give individual communities the discretion to determine the level of alcohol availability that will be permitted within their boundaries, or because the penalties for violating the provisions are based upon quantity and type of alcoholic beverage.

        Given the state’s compelling interest in curbing alcohol abuse, the provisions of the local option law are reasonable and sufficiently related to the legislative goal of protecting the public health and welfare so that they do not violate this section; equal protection does not require perfect equality and uniformity in the application of a regulatory scheme.

        Where taxpayers alleged that a borough violated their equal protection rights by failing to collect a borough sales tax on long-distance phone calls charged to phones within the borough from certain customers of a telephone company, in order to avoid summary judgment on the issue of whether such a violation has occurred, taxpayers must produce evidence tending to show a dispute exists over whether unequal enforcement of the tax has taken place, and whether the selective enforcement was part of an arbitrary or intentional plan to discriminate.

        The 1984 creation of Senate District E tended toward disproportionality of representation and therefore impermissibly discriminated against Anchorage voters under Alaska’s equal protection clause, even though it was not violative of the federal equal protection clause; however, since the effect of the discrimination was de minimus, the state was not required to redraw the district. Kenai Peninsula Borough v. State, 743 P.2d 1352 (Alaska 1987).

         Carpenter v. Hammond
        </i>
        , 667 P.2d 1204 (Alaska 1983) effectuates consistent and rational state policies and, therefore, does not violate the equal protection clauses of either the federal or Alaska Constitution.
        Kenai Peninsula Borough v. State, 743 P.2d 1352 (Alaska 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is no fundamental right at stake, the equal protection clause of the Alaska Constitution imposes a stricter standard than its federal counterpart; hence, while the applicable federal equal protection standard in reapportionment cases has not been clearly established, the court will continue to use Alaska’s stricter equal protection standard when assessing the constitutionality of a reapportionment plan. Kenai Peninsula Borough v. State, 743 P.2d 1352 (Alaska 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        In cases challenging reapportionment, the presentation of evidence that indicates, when considered with the totality of the circumstances, that the state acted intentionally to discriminate against the voters of a geographic area will serve to compel the state to demonstrate that its acts aimed to effectuate proportional representation, that is, the state will have the burden of proving that any intentional discrimination against voters of a particular area will lead to more proportional representation. Kenai Peninsula Borough v. State, 743 P.2d 1352 (Alaska 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        A neutral factors test should be employed to assess the legitimacy of the state’s purpose in designing a district. Under such a test a court looks both to the process followed by the state in formulating its decision as well as to the substance of the state’s decision in order to ascertain whether the state intentionally discriminated against a particular geographic area. Kenai Peninsula Borough v. State, 743 P.2d 1352 (Alaska 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although Alaska courts will not consider any effect of disproportionality de minimus in determining whether the state’s purpose in designing reapportioned districts is illegitimate, the degree of disproportionality will be considered in determining the appropriate relief to be granted.

        Consideration of religion in child custody cases. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Former AS 09.55.205, in specifying that the “religious needs” of the child could be considered in awarding custody, was not unconstitutional on its face. That section was limited to cases where particular religious practices or beliefs posed a substantial threat of or would have resulted in actual physical, emotional or mental injury to the child or would otherwise have a harmful effect on the child in violation of valid state statutes. In addition, the court could consider the actual religious needs of a mature child. Bonjour v. Bonjour, 592 P.2d 1233 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is constitutionally permissible for a court to take account of the actual religious needs of a child in awarding custody to one parent or another. Former AS 09.55.205, insofar as it permitted a court to consider the “religious needs” of a minor as an aspect of the child’s “best interest,” did not infringe upon constitutionally protected rights. However, the court had to make a finding that the child had actual, not presumed, religious needs, and that one parent would be more able to satisfy those needs than the other parent. Bonjour v. Bonjour, 592 P.2d 1233 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       By actual religious needs, the supreme court refers to the expressed preference of a child mature enough to make a choice between a form of religion or the lack of it. Bonjour v. Bonjour, 592 P.2d 1233 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       So long as a court makes findings as to a child’s actual needs respecting religion, the court may consider such needs, as one factor, in awarding custody. In such consideration, the court, however, may not substitute its own preferences, either for or against a particular type of religious observance, but must retain a strict neutrality. Bonjour v. Bonjour, 592 P.2d 1233 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court’s reliance on the religious affiliations of the parties, in the absence of a showing of actual religious needs of the child, constitutes the use of an improper criterion. Bonjour v. Bonjour, 592 P.2d 1233 (Alaska 1979).

       Where a hospital is constructed and a lease made by a city to a sectarian order of the Catholic faith in order to provide for the care of the sick, without regard to race, color, or creed, and thus accomplish a valid public purpose, there is nothing in this arrangement from which it can be inferred that a tax-established, public institution is to be utilized to aid a religious group to spread its faith or to interfere with the religious beliefs of others. The city’s action was not designed, nor does it have the effect by its nature, of promoting or giving a preferred position to whatever religious beliefs the individual members of the corporation might have. The fact that specific sectarian beliefs may be entertained by those persons does not bar the city from achieving its valid secular goal of caring for the sick. Lien v. City of Ketchikan, 383 P.2d 721 (Alaska 1963).

        Freedom of speech and the correlative freedom of association are fundamental rights which lie at the foundation of our system of government. Alaska Gay Coalition v. Sullivan, 578 P.2d 951 (Alaska 1978).

         Protection under state constitution. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Alaska Constitution protects free speech in a more explicit and direct manner than the federal constitution.
        Messerli v. State, 626 P.2d 81 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The free speech clause of this section was meant to be at least as protective of expression as the 1st amendment to the United States Constitution.Mickens v. City of Kodiak, 640 P.2d 818 (Alaska 1982).

         Right is not absolute. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In expressing the rights to free speech and privacy, the framers of the state constitution appear to have recognized a right of universal freedom and a right to be left alone which is rooted in the natural inclination of human beings. But these rights, in a free society such as this, have never been recognized as absolute and without limitations. Messerli v. State, 626 P.2d 81 (Alaska 1980).

        <b>
         Right to free association related to ballot design. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court did not abuse its discretion by denying candidate's requested preliminary injunction because it could have imperiled the public interest in an orderly and timely election; she did not show a clear probability of success on her claim that her rights to free association were violated. Ballot design applied uniformly across candidates and she did not explain how that design, by omitting her nonpartisan voter registration status, prevented voters from associating with her or compelled them to associate with the Democratic Party. State v. Galvin, 491 P.3d 325 (Alaska 2021).

        <b>
         Function of free speech. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        A function of free speech under the American system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger. Marks v. Anchorage, 500 P.2d 644 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>

        <b>
         Robust debate encouraged. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open. Marks v. Anchorage, 500 P.2d 644 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        This nation is most likely to flourish by selecting direction from a multitude of voices engaged in vigorous debate rather than from authoritative selection by government officials. Marks v. Anchorage, 500 P.2d 644 (Alaska 1972).

         Independent candidates allowed to run in party's primary elections. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Political party had an associational right to choose its general election nominees and that right could include allowing independents to run in its primary elections. Because the Alaska Constitution's free association guarantee protects the party's choice to open its primary elections to independent voter candidates, and because in this specific context the State had no countervailing need to enforce the party affiliation rule, the superior court properly ruled in favor of the party in its suit for declaratory and injunctive relief preventing enforcement of the party affiliation rule. State v. Alaska Democratic Party, 426 P.3d 901 (Alaska 2018).

         Sufficient injury. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of the right to fair treatment and the “liberty of expression in appropriate places” is injury enough. Alaska Gay Coalition v. Sullivan, 578 P.2d 951 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the suppression of speech in itself which is the evil to be avoided for such suppression necessarily impairs the right to speak freely. Any further showing of adverse consequences flowing therefrom is unnecessary. Alaska Gay Coalition v. Sullivan, 578 P.2d 951 (Alaska 1978).

         Regulation, not censorship, allowed. —

        <b>
         Precision of regulation must be the touchstone. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of the “chilling effect” that overbroad laws have on the exercise of constitutional rights, broad prophylactic rules are suspect and precision of regulation must be the touchstone. Marks v. Anchorage, 500 P.2d 644 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        First amendment freedoms are delicate and vulnerable, as well as supremely precious in American society. The threat of sanctions may deter their exercise almost as potently as the actual application of sanctions. Because first amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive, government may regulate in the area only with narrow specificity. Marks v. Anchorage, 500 P.2d 644 (Alaska 1972).

       <p>
        Closing-hours restriction in a municipal ordinance could not be enforced against adult cabarets in light of the Free Speech Clause of the Alaska Constitution because the closing-hours restriction, as applied to adult cabarets, was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to achieve its ends. Club Sinrock, LLC v. Municipality of Anchorage, 445 P.3d 1031 (Alaska 2019).

       </p>
       <p>
        The 1st and 14th amendments do not permit a state to make criminal the exercise of the right of assembly simply because its exercise may be “annoying” to some people. If this were not the rule, the right of the people to gather in public places for social or political purposes would be continually subject to summary suspension through the good-faith enforcement of a prohibition against annoying conduct. And such a prohibition, in addition, contains an obvious invitation to discriminatory enforcement against those whose association together is “annoying” because their ideas, their lifestyle, or their physical appearance is resented by the majority of their fellow citizens. Marks v. Anchorage, 500 P.2d 644 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>

       </p>

Alaska Gay Coalition v. Sullivan, 578 P.2d 951 (Alaska 1978).

       <p>
        The statutory requirement that a group attain at least three percent of the votes polled in the last gubernatorial election, or register the equivalent number of voters, to be recognized as a political party was constitutional because: (1) The voters were not totally deprived of the opportunity to place candidates on the ballot; (2) the state’s interest in requiring a significant modicum of support was compelling because it helped avoid confusion, deception, and frustration of the democratic process at the general election; and (3) the requirement was sufficiently narrowly tailored to the state’s interests to justify burdening the voters’ rights.

        An individual’s right of expression in the circumstances of an expenditure in advocating the election or defeat of a particular candidate consists of giving the candidate funds to convey the candidate’s message to the public.

       <p>
        Speech is often provocative and challenging. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea. That is why freedom of speech, though not absolute, is nevertheless protected against censorship or punishment, unless shown likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest. Anniskette v. State, 489 P.2d 1012 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        What finally emerges from the “clear and present danger” cases is a working principle that the substantive evil must be extremely serious and the degree of imminence extremely high before utterances can be punished. Anniskette v. State, 489 P.2d 1012 (Alaska 1971).

       <p>

       <p>
        The district court did not err in rejecting defendant’s defense that violations of commercial fishing laws were acts of civil disobedience where the laws under which he was charged were content neutral as to any expressive element of a violation; they further an important or substantial state interest that is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; any incidental restriction on First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest; and they leave open alternative channels for communication of the protest message.

       <p>
        Although the overbreadth and void-for-vagueness doctrines are related and, at least in the 1st amendment area, not wholly separable, they are functionally and doctrinally distinct. The overbreadth doctrine has evolved to give adequate breathing room to specific 1st amendment freedoms. A vague statute violates the due process clause both because it fails to give adequate notice to the ordinary citizen of what is prohibited and because its indefinite contours confer unbridled discretion on government officials and thereby raise the possibility of uneven and discriminatory enforcement.

         Criminal defamation statutes held unconstitutional. —

       </p>
       <p>
        In holding former AS 11.15.310 — 11.15.330 to be unconstitutionally vague the supreme court did not decide whether all conceivable criminal libel statutes are necessarily vague. If the type of defamation sought to be prohibited receives a narrowly drawn statutory definition, especially one designed to reach words tending to cause a breach of the peace, then such a statute might well be proper. Gottschalk v. State, 575 P.2d 289 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if the former criminal defamation statutes were sufficiently precise to escape the defect of vagueness, they would still have been overbroad. That is because truth was not an absolute defense under former AS 11.15.320, but a conditional one; the accused had to show not only that what he said was true, but that his intentions were good when he said it. Gottschalk v. State, 575 P.2d 289 (Alaska 1978).

        Since former AS 11.15.134(a), which made it a crime to commit a lewd or lascivious act upon or with the body of a child under 16 years of age, intending to arouse the sexual desires of either the actor or the child, prohibited only lewd and lascivious physical contact with children, that section did not implicate the constitutional right of adults to possess and exhibit literature or the right of adults to privacy in their homes at least insofar as that right protects parents dressing in front of children, those who tell dirty jokes, and adults who are passionately affectionate with other adults in the presence of children.

       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court has recognized the strong likelihood that former AS 11.45.030, which made disorderly conduct and disturbance of the peace a misdemeanor, as it existed prior to the 1973 amendment, was overbroad in that constitutionally protected speech and conduct might have fallen within its prohibitions.

        Those portions of a disorderly conduct ordinance which could be applied to protected speech — “threatening,” “tumultuous behavior,” “unreasonable noise,” “offensively coarse utterance, gesture, or display” and “addressing abusive language to any person present” — are unconstitutionally overbroad.

       <p>
        An ordinance making it a criminal offense for “three or more persons to assemble . . . on any of the sidewalks . . . and there conduct themselves in a manner annoying to persons passing by . . . .” is not only overbroad but also unconstitutionally vague. Since conduct that annoys some people does not annoy others, men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at the ordinance’s meaning. Marks v. Anchorage, 500 P.2d 644 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        An ordinance prohibiting “threatening and violent or tumultuous behavior,” “unreasonable noise,” “abusive lanugage” and “offensively coarse utterances, gestures or displays” when motivated by an intent to cause “public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm,” thereby making it a crime for one, with intent to cause public embarrassment, uneasiness, annoyance, discomfort, or fear, to engage in conduct that is noisy, disorderly, causing or evidencing mental or emotional excitement, or, with like intent, to use language that is vulgar, indelicate, distasteful, insulting or reproachful is unconstitutional. Neither the federal nor Alaska constitutions will permit such a broad and arbitrary interference with freedom of speech. Marks v. Anchorage, 500 P.2d 644 (Alaska 1972).

       A project labor agreement, approved by a borough for a construction project, requiring workers to pay dues and fees required by unions did not violate the right of nonunion employees to be free of “forced association.” Laborers Local # 942 v. Lampkin, 956 P.2d 422 (Alaska 1998).

       Trial court properly dismissed plaintiff former assemblyman’s implied constitutional tort cause of action under Alaska Const. art. I, § 6 because plaintiff did not allege that he was actually prevented from petitioning the government; rather, only that defendants intended to discourage future petitioners like himself. Even assuming that all of plaintiff’s assertions were true, the constitutional violation he alleged, if there was one at all, was not “flagrant.” Lowell v. Hayes, 117 P.3d 745 (Alaska 2005).

       </p>
       <p>
        Both this section and the 14th amendment of the United States Constitution prohibit the state from depriving any person of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Bush v. Reid, 516 P.2d 1215 (Alaska 1973).

        <b>
         Borough was not a “person”
        </b>
        and therefore could not assert due process or equal protection claims against its creator, the state. The purpose of the Alaska due process and equal protection clauses is to protect people from abuses of government, not to protect political subdivisions of the state from the actions of other units of state government. Kenai Peninsula Borough v. State, Dep't of Cmty. &amp; Reg'l Affairs, 751 P.2d 14 (Alaska 1988).

         Standing. —

       <p>
        Legislators did not have standing to bring suit against a legislative committee and an investigator in an attempt to halt an allegedly politically motivated investigation into the governor’s dismissal of the public safety commissioner. They were not directly affected by the investigation and had suffered no injury to their own interests. Keller v. French, 205 P.3d 299 (Alaska 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        While appellant may have had opportunities to present evidence that showed he met the standing criteria with respect to a planning commission's approval of a conditional use permit, appellant had no reason to seek to present such evidence because he had no notice that standing was at issue. Because appellant did not have notice that his standing was at issue, his due process rights were violated. Griswold v. Homer Bd. of Adjustment, 426 P.3d 1044 (Alaska 2018).

        <b>
         Identification of the specific dictates of due process
        </b>
        generally involves consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and, finally, the government’s interest including the fiscal and administrative burdens that additional or substitute procedural requirements would entail.

         Due process right to protect juvenile offender status. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court erred in granting the State's waiver petition because defendant juvenile had a due process right to present evidence at the waiver hearing to protect his juvenile offender status and avoid being waived to adult court; minors alleged to have violated Alaska's criminal laws, including those for whom the State is seeking to waive juvenile jurisdiction, have a liberty interest in juvenile status.

       <p>
        <b>
         For the due process clause to apply,

        there must be state action and the deprivation of an individual interest of sufficient importance to warrant constitutional protection. Nichols v. Eckert, 504 P.2d 1359 (Alaska 1973); State, Dep't of Nat. Res. v. Universal Educ. Soc'y, Inc., 583 P.2d 806 (Alaska 1978).

       <p>
        Mother's contention
        that the appearance of judicial partiality violated her due process
        rights was rejected because, although the trial court may have exhibited
        partiality related to whether substance abuse continued to substantially
        impair the mother's ability to parent, that only impacted one of the
        grounds for termination of the mother's parental rights. The mother's
        ability to be heard and adequately represent her interests with respect
        to the domestic violence and mental illness findings was not prejudiced,
        and the child's best interests would not be served by delaying permanency
        and prolonging the judicial proceedings given that the mother had
        yet to remedy the conduct or conditions that made him a child in need
        of aid. Sarah A. v. State Dep't of Health &amp; Soc. Servs., Office of Children Servs., 427 P.3d 771 (Alaska 2018).

         The nature of protection due

       <p>
        The finding of a deprivation of a property right does not conclude a due process analysis; the assessment of what process is due requires a balancing of the individual’s interest against the state’s justification for its enactment. Bush v. Reid, 516 P.2d 1215 (Alaska 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whenever a party demonstrates a prima facie denial of due process of law, the reviewing court must balance the interest of the state in the act or procedure challenged against the right denied the individual. Aguchak v. Montgomery Ward Co., 520 P.2d 1352 (Alaska 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        What procedural due process may require under any particular set of circumstances depends on the nature of the governmental function involved and the private interest affected by the governmental action. Arctic Structures v. Wedmore, 605 P.2d 426 (Alaska 1979).

        Superior court did not abuse its discretion by denying a prisoner's request for transport to attend in person the prisoner's parental rights termination trial because the court considered all relevant factors that the parties presented to the court, because it was not obvious that considering additional factors in the case law would have changed the court's statutory analysis, and because the prisoner's due process rights were not violated.

         The term “due process of law”
        </b>
        is not susceptible of precise definition or reduction to a mathematical formula. But in the course of judicial decisions it has come to express a basic concept of justice under law. Bachner v. Pearson, 479 P.2d 319 (Alaska 1970).

        The term “due process of law” is not susceptible of precise definition or reduction to a mathematical formula. But in the course of judicial decisions it has come to express a basic concept of justice under law, such as “our traditional conception of fair play and substantial justice,” the “protection of the individual from arbitrary action,” “fundamental principles of liberty and justice,” whether there has been a “denial of fundamental fairness, shocking to the universal sense of justice,” “that whole community sense of decency and fairness that has been woven by common experience into the fabric of acceptable conduct,” and a “respect for those personal immunities which are so rooted in the traditions and consciences of the nation as to be ranked as fundamental, or are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” Green v. State, 462 P.2d 994 (Alaska 1969), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 910, 90 S. Ct. 1704, 26 L. Ed. 2d 70 (U.S. 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts have not attempted to define with precision the words “due process of law.” Probably this is so because that term asserts a fundamental principle of justice, rather than a specific rule of law, and thus is not susceptible of more than a general statement. Territory v. Craig Enters., 355 P.2d 397 (Alaska 1960).

        to assure compliance with due process under Alaska law is more limited than the broad form of review required under the Alaska Administrative Procedure Act ( AS 44.62). The safeguard which due process assures is not that a court may examine each factual finding to see that it is correct, or even that it is supported by substantial evidence. Rather, the supreme court will review to assure that the trier of fact was an impartial tribunal, that no findings were made except on due notice and opportunity to be heard, that the procedure at the hearing was consistent with a fair trial, and that the hearing was conducted in such a way that there is an opportunity for a court to ascertain whether the applicable rules of law and procedure were observed. The review of factual determinations becomes a review to find whether the administrative decision has passed beyond the lowest limit of the permitted zone of reasonableness to become capricious, arbitrary or confiscatory.

        Due process requires some separation between those persons prosecuting a complaint and those adjudicating it; the prosecutor, who has a “probable partiality,” should not be in a position to influence the decision makers.

        When an administrative official has participated in the past in any advocacy capacity against the party in question, fundamental fairness is normally held to require that the former advocate take no part in rendering the decision.

        Given the strong state interest in assuring that those entering the practice of law have had suitable training in adequate institutions, and considering the precedent from other jurisdictions, the supreme court finds that the Alaska bar rule requirement that a bar applicant be a graduate of an American Bar Association-accredited law school, Alaska Bar Rule 2, § 1(b), is valid and does not violate the due process clause of either the Alaska Constitution or the United States Constitution.

        Because the father's requested modification, seeking full legal and physical custody, and the trial court's order, giving the father primary custody, were both material and substantial alternations to the existing custody arrangements, due process required the trial court to hold a hearing before entering the custody modification so that the mother could have offered witnesses and other evidence and challenged the custody investigator's findings.

       <p>
        An attachment upon a debtor’s property under Civ. R. 89 gives the creditor great leverage: It pressures the debtor to do whatever is necessary to recover his property. Since this pressure often causes debtors to abandon legal rights, a challenge to the constitutionality of Civ. R. 89 may evade review. Therefore a debtor’s consent to judgment does not moot his constitutional challenge under this section. Etheredge v. Bradley, 502 P.2d 146 (Alaska 1972).

        A photographic lineup was not so suggestive as to create “a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification” where as many as three of the six photographs used in the lineup matched the victim’s description of a light-skinned black with short hair.

        “Show-up” identification of defendant did not violate his due process rights where a violent crime had been committed some thirty minutes before, and the suspect remained at large; by bringing the victim to the scene of the traffic stop, the police could either positively identify defendant as the man they were looking for, or eliminate him as a suspect and resume their search of the city for a similar brown sedan.

        The constitutional right of a defendant to be present in the courtroom at every stage of the trial has been implemented as a procedural requirement by Cr. R. 38. State v. Hannagan, 559 P.2d 1059 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional right to be present at every stage of trial has been implemented by the provisions of Cr. R. 38(a) which provides that the “defendant shall be present at the arraignment, at the preliminary hearing, at the time of plea, at the omnibus hearing, and at every stage of the trial, including the impaneling of the jury and return of the verdict, and at the imposition of sentence, except as otherwise provided in this rule.” Dixon v.

         Scope of right to be present. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Under both the United States Constitution and the Alaska Constitution the right of the defendant to be present at every stage of the trial has been recognized. Included within the scope of this right is the period of jury deliberations; thus, the defendant has the right to be present whenever any communication between the court and the jury occurs during those deliberations. Dixon v. State, 605 P.2d 882 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s convictions for murder in the first degree and tampering with physical evidence were appropriate because, although defendant’s right to be present at all stages of his trial was violated, errors were harmless; also, defendant did not argue any specific prejudice arising from superior court’s decision to release juror who was ill, and even if juror had not been excused, there was no certainty that juror would have deliberated on the case. Collins v. State, 182 P.3d 1159 (Alaska Ct. App. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court may exclude a criminal defendant for disruptive behavior, and although the court had to allow an excluded criminal defendant an opportunity to reclaim his right to be present if he demonstrated willingness to behave appropriately, it was not obliged to uncritically accept every promise to behave; the trial court did not abuse its discretion either by removing defendant from the courtroom or by refusing his later request to reenter where nothing in defendant’s words or in his recent or past conduct demonstrated that it was an abuse of discretion to decline to return him to the courtroom one more time.

        Where defendant was charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, denial of the right to make an analysis of some of the components of the breathalyzer machine, that is to say, to “cross-examine” the results of the test, would be reversible error without any need for a showing of prejudice. It would be a denial of a right to a fair trial, and a fair trial is essential to affording an accused due process of law. Lauderdale v. State, 548 P.2d 376 (Alaska 1976).

        It was harmless error for prosecution to cross-examine defense expert on the absence of autopsy slides because defendant had remedies for the error at trial.

It was reasonable for the defense expert to conclude that, because he had not received any slides, none existed.

        Although the indictment used the language of shooting with the intent to kill “and” wound and instructions to the jury followed the statutory language of shooting with intent to kill “or” wound, defendant received adequate notice of the charge against him, there was no ambiguity as to the incident involved, and he was in a position to claim double jeopardy if again charged with the offense of shooting with intent to kill or wound arising out of this incident; due process was not violated, since, even assuming that six jurors believed defendant to have the intent of wounding and six the intent of killing, in either event, he would be guilty of the charge, and those finding the intent to kill would have necessarily found an intent to wound, as one cannot kill by shooting without wounding.

        The use of a jury instruction which states that witnesses are presumed to speak the truth is condemned, since it interferes with the province of the jury to determine credibility of witnesses, it seems to conflict with the presumption of innocence, and the instruction serves to raise doubt in the juror’s mind as to his role and adds a confusing factor to jury deliberations.

         Pre-accusation delay. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Both the Alaska and federal constitutional guarantees of due process of law serve to protect a defendant against the hazards of pre-accusation delay. Marks v. State, 496 P.2d 66 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        A claim of pre-accusation delay must sound in terms of deprivation of due process of law. Coffey v. State, 585 P.2d 514 (Alaska 1978); Alexander v. State, 611 P.2d 469 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        A claim of pre-accusation delay must sound in terms of deprivation of due process of law under the 14th amendment to the United States Constitution and this section. The United States Constitution’s 6th amendment does not afford speedy trial protection until the commencement of formal proceedings. Similarly, the Alaska constitutional right to speedy trial, embodied in art. I, § 11, does not attach prior to formal accusation. Dixon v. State, 605 P.2d 882 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Two factors have been considered relevant in deciding whether substantial delay in accusation constitutes a denial of federal due process: The reasonableness of the delay and the probable prejudice accruing from the delay. In order to assess a claim of due process deprivation, the governmental interest in postponing accusation must be weighed against the defendant’s interest in early notice of the charges against him. In sum, both the absence of a valid reason for pre-accusation delay and the fact of prejudice must be established in order to support a due process claim. Marks v. State, 496 P.2d 66 (Alaska 1972); Dixon v. State, 605 P.2d 882 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the supreme court has recognized that there may be reason to dismiss criminal charges because of prejudice suffered by a defendant because of pre-indictment delay, such a decision must be based on a consideration of several factors. The reason for delay, the prejudice to defendant, and the governmental interest in postponing accusation must be evaluated to assess a claim of violation of due process with respect to events occurring prior to indictment.
        P.H. v. State, 504 P.2d 837 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to show pre-accusation delay warranting a dismissal, a defendant must show (1) the absence of valid reasons for such delay and (2) the fact that the defendant was prejudiced by the delay. Yarbor v. State, 546 P.2d 564 (Alaska 1976); Coffey v. State, 585 P.2d 514 (Alaska 1978); Prenesti v. State, 594 P.2d 63 (Alaska 1979); Alexander v. State, 611 P.2d 469 (Alaska 1980); Burke v. State, 624 P.2d 1240 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Some delay between offense and formal charge is clearly justified in cases involving drug undercover agents. McKay v. State, 489 P.2d 145 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A preindictment delay by the prosecution to gather potentially exculpatory evidence is clearly not an unreasonable delay. Burke v. State, 624 P.2d 1240 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s generalized claim of possibly lost witnesses and failed memories failed to meet the actual prejudice requirement and thus did not support a finding that his right to due process was violated by a pre-accusation delay.
        State v. Mouser, 806 P.2d 330 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The defendant bears the burden
        </b>
        of showing that the delay was unreasonable and that he was prejudiced thereby. Coffey v. State, 585 P.2d 514 (Alaska 1978); Dixon v. State, 605 P.2d 882 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of proving prejudice flowing from the pre-accusation delay lies with the defendant. Prenesti v. State, 594 P.2d 63 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        That the ultimate burden of proof is on the defendant does not mean that the state is relieved of the burden of coming forward with reasons for the delay, matters normally within the exclusive knowledge of the state. Rather, the defendant must show that the reasons so advanced do not justify the delay. Coffey v. State, 585 P.2d 514 (Alaska 1978); Dixon v. State, 605 P.2d 882 (Alaska 1980); Burke v. State, 624 P.2d 1240 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of proof is on the defendant to show the absence of a valid reason for the delay and the fact of prejudice, though the state has the burden, once the issue is raised, to come forward with reasons for the delay. When reasons are advanced, the defendant must show that they do not justify the delay. Alexander v. State, 611 P.2d 469 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if there is no reason advanced for the delay, the defendant must still show actual and substantial prejudice in order to prevail. Wilson v. State, 756 P.2d 307 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a dog-bite case, defendant’s equal protection rights were not violated despite assertions that she had been treated differently than other owners of biting dogs; she offered no evidence to support an inference that the treatment was motivated by her racial heritage.

        In a prosecution for rape, a delay of nearly five months between the occurrence of the event in dispute and the return of the indictment did not prejudice the accused’s defense so as to effectively deny him due process of law. Dixon v. State, 605 P.2d 882 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        A five-month pre-indictment delay in a statutory rape prosecution is reasonable in light of the investigation undertaken by the police and an understandable reluctance to rush this type of case before the grand jury by the district attorney, and given the minimal possible prejudice which could have resulted from the delay.

         A seven-month interval

       </p>
       <p>
        Although an eight-month delay in filing formal charges against defendant was unreasonable, defendant was not sufficiently prejudiced by the delay to warrant dismissal of the charges. Prenesti v. State, 594 P.2d 63 (Alaska 1979).

        Defendant’s absence from hearing was not reversible error because nothing of significance happened at the omnibus hearing, even though defendant would have been alerted to the fact that a particular judge would be trying the case, and that his counsel was contemplating stipulating to a trial date more than 120 days from the date of his arrest.

       <p>
        A trial court should make a more exacting inquiry to assure a defendant’s understanding of the charge when he seeks to enter a guilty plea pro se than is required when he is represented by counsel. Routine questions on the subject of understanding are insufficient, and a single response by a pro se defendant that he “understands” a charge is inadequate assurance or basis for believing that he does.

        <b>
         Nonrepresented defendant’s guilty plea

Therefore, his plea was involuntary since he did not receive real notice of the true nature of the charge against him, and his judgment of conviction was entered without due process of law. Else v.

        , 418 U.S. 539, 94 S. Ct. 2963, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1974), the United States supreme court held that when major prison disciplinary proceedings are instituted against a state prisoner, due process requires giving the inmate at least 24-hour advance written notice of the alleged violation; supplying the inmate with a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action; allowing the inmate facing disciplinary action to call witnesses and to present documentary evidence in his behalf when to do so will not be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals; and allowing an illiterate inmate, or an inmate facing a complex issue, to have assistance in marshalling and presenting evidence and in comprehending the issues of the case.
        McGinnis v. Stevens, 570 P.2d 735 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Alaska’s constitution requires greater due process protections than the United States Constitution in the following respects: A prisoner has the right to counsel in conjunction with major disciplinary proceedings when felony prosecution may result; the right to call witnesses and produce documentary evidence in his favor (subject to the limitations discussed previously); the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses; and the right to have the entire hearing recorded for purposes of administrative appeal and potential further appeal to the superior court. McGinnis v. Stevens, 543 P.2d 1221 (Alaska 1975); McGinnis v. Stevens, 570 P.2d 735 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Alaska Constitution affords an inmate of Alaska’s penal system no greater protection than the United States Constitution in the following respects: a disciplinary proceeding is not a criminal proceeding, thus the inmate has no automatic right of appeal to the courts of Alaska; the standard of proof, in disciplinary hearings, of violation of prison rules is not “beyond a reasonable doubt”; and, while the inmate is entitled to a fair and impartial hearing, it is not constitutionally impermissible for the hearing to be conducted by employees of the prison system. McGinnis v. Stevens, 543 P.2d 1221 (Alaska 1975); McGinnis v. Stevens, 570 P.2d 735 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prisoners who are subjected to minor disciplinary action by prison authorities are entitled to no more due process than a right to be heard by fair and impartial officials of the prison system whose disposition of the matter, coupled with the reasons for the decision, is made part of a complete record. McGinnis v. Stevens, 570 P.2d 735 (Alaska 1977).

        There are limitations on the right of Alaska prisoners to call witnesses and to produce documentary evidence in their favor, and the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses. McGinnis v. Stevens, 570 P.2d 735 (Alaska 1977).

        A prisoner has the right to challenge the disciplinary procedures of the department of corrections by means of an appeal to the superior court. The payment of filing fees is required to limit frivolous appeals, however, a prisoner cannot be denied access to the superior court due to inability to pay the filing fee. Barber v.

        expressly provides the court the ability to grant an extension of time for paying the filing fee, and it is logical to conclude that this also encompasses the discretion to allow installment payments, but extensions and installment payments provide no relief for prisoners with no reasonably foreseeable income to make payment, and delay while installments are paid does not provide constitutionally adequate court access to prisoners without funds or income.

The amount calculated for this prisoner required him to pay a fee far higher than his actual assets, and higher than he was likely to have within a reasonable time.

        The due process clause of the Alaska Constitution guarantees indigent parents a right to the effective assistance of counsel in proceedings brought to terminate their parental rights. V.F. v. State, 666 P.2d 42 (Alaska 1983).

        Due process requires that an indigent natural parent be appointed an attorney to assist him in demonstrating why his consent to the adoption of his child should not be rendered unnecessary. In re K.L.J., 813 P.2d 276 (Alaska 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court erred in not appointing an attorney to represent a disabled, indigent father when his ex-wife’s husband petitioned the court to waive the natural father’s consent and terminate his parental rights so that the ex-wife’s husband could adopt the daughter of the divorced couple because the Alaska Constitution mandates that the superior court appoint an attorney when an indigent parent’s right to consent to an adoption of his or her child may be waived under AS

         Appointment of counsel in paternity suits. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In light of the fact that paternity suits, in effect, are brought by the state, the significance of the parent-child relationship involved and the peculiar problems presented in such a proceeding, due process requires the appointment of counsel for an indigent defendant. Reynolds v. Kimmons, 569 P.2d 799 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a paternity case, the issues may take on an even greater complexity than those involved in a custody termination proceeding. This consideration underscores the need for counsel. The court may be required to assess testimony pertaining to sexual conduct which is labeled as a crime by an Alaska statute. Decisions pertaining to blood tests and the proper examination of witnesses on complex scientific issues may also be necessary. In addition to the obligation of support, rights of inheritance may be affected. Reynolds v. Kimmons, 569 P.2d 799 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indirect outcome of a paternity suit could be a criminal charge. At a trial on such a charge, evidence introduced and admissions made without assistance of counsel in the paternity suit could play a significant role. Also, the support decree is enforceable by contempt proceedings which likewise could result in incarceration. In such contempt proceedings, the establishment of paternity and the amount of support payments would be res judicata. Reynolds v. Kimmons, 569 P.2d 799 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The analogy of a paternity suit to other cases in which the supreme court has held that a right to counsel exists is further strengthened by the fact that the proceeding is being prosecuted by an attorney general rather than private counsel. Reynolds v. Kimmons, 569 P.2d 799 (Alaska 1977).

       </p>
       <p>
        Due process did not mandate court-appointed counsel for the father, an indigent parent, in a custody matter, where the opposing parent was represented by private counsel, as the private interests of the parents did not rise to an unconstitutional level since the assistance available to all self-represented parents was available to the father, who capably represented himself and impeached the mother's credibility.

       Section 8. Grand Jury.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the armed forces in time of war or public danger. Indictment may be waived by the accused. In that case the prosecution shall be by information. The grand jury shall consist of at least twelve citizens, a majority of whom concurring may return an indictment. The power of grand juries to investigate and make recommendations concerning the public welfare or safety shall never be suspended.

      <p>
       The language of this section relating to the grand jury is identical with a like provision in the 5th amendment to the federal constitution.State v. Shelton, 368 P.2d 817 (Alaska 1962).

        Rights of an accused. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An accused is entitled, under Alaska law, to a decision by a grand jury that there is probable cause to hold him for trial. Michael v. State, 805 P.2d 371 (Alaska 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The purpose served by grand jury indictment
       </b>
       is to give one accused of a serious offense the benefit of having private citizens judge whether there is probable cause to hold the accused for trial. Theoretically this acts as a check upon the district attorney’s power to initiate criminal prosecutions, and insures the protection of the innocent against oppression and unjust prosecution. Doe v. State, 487 P.2d 47 (Alaska 1971).

      <p>
       To indict a defendant for a crime, Alaska Crim. R. 6(n)(1) requires the concurrence of a majority of the grand jurors sworn in, not just a majority of the jurors who deliberate on the case, and this is a valid exercise of the supreme court’s rule-making authority and does not violate this section. Sanford v. State, 24 P.3d 1263 (Alaska Ct. App. 2001).

        Protection of the innocent

      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose served by grand jury indictment is to give one accused of a serious offense the benefit of having private citizens judge whether there is probable cause to hold the accused for trial. The grand jury protects the innocent from unjust prosecution by acting as a check on the prosecutor. Adams v. State, 598 P.2d 503 (Alaska 1979).

        Children need not be indicted by grand jury. —

      <p>
       Children who are charged with acts which would be chargeable only by grand jury indictment if committed by an adult need not be indicted by a grand jury. Doe v. State, 487 P.2d 47 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right to grand jury indictment is not so fundamental that due process is offended by alternate methods for instituting children’s proceedings where the child is charged with having violated a criminal statute. Doe v. State, 487 P.2d 47 (Alaska 1971).

       The grand jury is an accusatorial body operating without a judicial officer to pass on the admissibility of evidence, and as such is charged with a determination of the probability of guilt. Coleman v. State, 553 P.2d 40 (Alaska 1976).

        Right to indictment by grand jury free of prosecutor-instigated prejudice. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Although no provision of the United States or Alaska constitutions specifically guarantees the right of an accused to be indicted by a grand jury free of prosecutor-instigated prejudice, a strong historical basis exists for holding that the grand jury should operate to control abuses by the government and protect the interests of the accused. Coleman v. State, 553 P.2d 40 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       When presenting a case to a grand jury the prosecutor should not make statements or arguments which would influence the grand jury in a manner that would be impermissible at trial. Putnam v. State, 629 P.2d 35 (Alaska 1980).

      </p>
      <p>
       Absent some evidence that the prosecutor knew or should have known that the response to his question would contain improper evidence, he is not held answerable for the utterances of the witness. This does not mean to imply that a prosecutor need not be concerned with the answers his questions might elicit. He remains under a duty to present to the grand jury only that evidence which he believes would be admissible at trial. Putnam v. State, 629 P.2d 35 (Alaska 1980).

       , that aggravating factor was not an element of defendant’s crime for purposes of the grand jury clause of the Alaska Constitution; thus, the state was not required to charge its proposed aggravating factor in defendant’s indictment, and defendant was not entitled to a new jury trial on the aggravating factors.

       In order to support a grand jury indictment, the hearsay evidence must present a sufficiently detailed account of the defendant’s activity and the hearsay declarant must be sufficiently reliable. Putnam v. State, 629 P.2d 35 (Alaska 1980).

      <p>
       Indictment against defendant for escaping from a halfway house was invalid because it was based on an incident report — prepared by a staff member at the halfway house, relaying another resident's description of defendant's conduct, and introduced to the grand jury through the testimony of an uninvolved supervisor — that was not admissible under the business records exception and without the report the evidence before the grand jury was insufficient to support an indictment. The error was not rendered harmless by defendant's conviction. Wassillie v. State, 411 P.3d 595 (Alaska 2018).

      <p>
       Permitting hearsay before a grand jury in cases of sexual assault on children does not deprive a defendant of due process or of the constitutional right to a grand jury review of the prosecution’s evidence before the return of an indictment. Murray v. State, 770 P.2d 1131 (Alaska Ct. App. 1989).

       Where defendant was indicted for assault in the first degree but convicted of second-degree assault on the theory that he had breached his duty as a parent to protect his child after becoming aware of the threat of physical abuse by the child’s mother, the conviction for an offense different than the one charged was a fatal variance, and required reversal.

        Where a defendant was convicted of three separate offenses, and the court imposed a single 15-year term without specifying the offenses to which it applied, the sentence amounted to an unlawful general sentence, so that the court’s subsequent finding of applicable aggravating factors and its resentencing of the defendant to a greater composite term than had originally been imposed violated the defendant’s right against double jeopardy. Love v. State, 799 P.2d 1343 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).

        Once a legal sentence is imposed which is within the discretion of the trial judge, the defendant’s sentence may not thereafter be increased. State v. LaPorte, 672 P.2d 466 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The modification of a sentence from two consecutive four-year terms of imprisonment to two concurrent terms of eight years each is illegal. The reason is that the modification or resentencing was in effect an increase of the sentence, and this is barred by the principle of double jeopardy. Huff v. State, 568 P.2d 1014 (Alaska 1977).

       <p>
        An original sentence which fell short of the mandatory minimum sentence for a second DWI offender, and was consequently illegal, was subject to correction under Criminal Rule 35(a) and was therefore not a “meaningfully imposed” sentence for double jeopardy purposes.

       <p>
        Double jeopardy and due process are not implicated when a person who has been acquitted of certain conduct is sentenced on the basis that the conduct occurred.
        The reason for this rests on the differing burdens of proof.
        In order to convict a defendant of an offense, the state must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Selman v. State, 406 P.2d 181 (Alaska 1965), overruled, Whitton v. State, 479 P.2d 302 (Alaska 1970); Lewis v. State, 452 P.2d 892 (Alaska 1969).

       <p>
        The fact that an accused has been placed on trial before a competent tribunal does not, standing alone, invariably bar his reprosecution if the trial did not result in a verdict. Lewis v. State, 452 P.2d 892 (Alaska 1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The double-jeopardy provision of the 5th amendment does not mean that every time a defendant is put to trial before a competent tribunal he is entitled to go free if the trial fails to end in a final judgment. There may be unforeseeable circumstances that arise during a trial making its completion impossible, such as the failure of a jury to agree on a verdict. A defendant’s valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal must in some instances be subordinated to the public’s interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments. Lewis v. State, 452 P.2d 892 (Alaska 1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The law has invested courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. In capital cases especially, courts should be extremely careful how they interfere with any of the chances of life in favor of the prisoner. The security which the public has for the faithful, sound and conscientious exercise of this discretion rests upon the responsibility of the judges under their oaths of office. Lewis v. State, 452 P.2d 892 (Alaska 1969).

        The fact that an individual is once placed in jeopardy does not mean that, if a mistrial is declared, he cannot later be brought to trial anew. Muller v. State, 478 P.2d 822 (Alaska 1971).

        Courts have recognized the involuntary absence of defendant and his counsel when the trial court discharges the jury as a factor in holding that the mistrial was not pursuant to a “manifest necessity.” Koehler v. State, 519 P.2d 442 (Alaska 1974).

        A “manifest necessity” must exist for all mistrials, including hung juries, before reprosecution is permissible under the double jeopardy clause. Koehler v. State, 519 P.2d 442 (Alaska 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        By requesting a mistrial, the defendant consents to the dismissal of the jury, and can therefore usually be retried. Muller v. State, 478 P.2d 822 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The prosecutor’s concurrence in the defendants’ motion for mistrial did not negate the effect of their request for mistrial, and the trial court was bound to make a specific inquiry into the issue of manifest necessity. Muller v. State, 478 P.2d 822 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the mistrial was entered on defendant’s motion and neither party disputed the propriety of the court’s granting a mistrial, manifest necessity was sufficiently established. Piesik v. State, 572 P.2d 94 (Alaska 1977).

MacPherson v. State, 533 P.2d 1103 (Alaska), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 871, 96 S. Ct. 137, 46 L. Ed. 2d 101 (U.S. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defense counsel did not effectively attempt to withdraw his request for a mistrial, and the trial court judge, in declaring a mistrial, was responding to defense counsel’s request, since the mistrial was thus declared at the request of the defendant, reprosecution of the defendant is not barred by the constitutional prohibitions against being placed twice in jeopardy. MacPherson v. State, 533 P.2d 1103 (Alaska), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 871, 96 S. Ct. 137, 46 L. Ed. 2d 101 (U.S. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally, when a trial is terminated at the defendant’s motion or with the defendant’s request, retrial is not prohibited by double jeopardy. Piesik v. State, 572 P.2d 94 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The possibility that a criminal defendant might claim error on appeal does not equate to manifest necessity; if a mistrial could be declared against the wishes of the accused every time potential error occurred, the constitutional protection against double jeopardy would become virtually meaningless.

        Where a potential conflict of interest arose from the fact that another assistant public defender (apparently not defendant’s counsel) had previously represented a key defense witness in connection with an unrelated matter, and it was not obvious that the potential conflict was an actual one, and it was not apparent that the conflict could not have been resolved by precluding the agency from representing the former client as a witness in defendant’s case, the court failed to adequately explore the existence of the conflict, or remedies short of a mistrial so that the mistrial violated defendant’s constitutional right against double jeopardy.

        There are instances of serious misconduct on the part of an accused, or his counsel, which make permissible both the granting of a mistrial and reprosecution. Such an occasion is where the accused or his counsel attempted to tamper with the jury. Lewis v. State, 452 P.2d 892 (Alaska 1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy should not be construed so as to permit intentional misconduct on the part of an accused or his counsel to become the basis of a bar to reprosecution. Lewis v. State, 452 P.2d 892 (Alaska 1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Research does not disclose any case in which the granting of a mistrial for misconduct of defense counsel has been upheld, although conceivably such action would be proper in case of misconduct going to the very vitals of the trial itself, for example, if the defendant or his counsel attempted to tamper with the jury. Minor misconduct of defense counsel, such as overstepping the limit set by the court for the examination of a witness, does not under the authorities warrant a mistrial thereby depriving the defendant of his right to secure a verdict from the jury that had been sworn to try him. Lewis v. State, 452 P.2d 892 (Alaska 1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Among the “necessities” which may deprive the accused of a right to rely on former jeopardy is that the mistrial was caused by the accused in consequence of his own wrong or request, or by his consent. But it is further noted that the occasion for it must be very cogent, or, as some courts have said, there must be an absolute necessity. Moreover, it must be determined in each case whether or not the circumstances necessitated a discharge of the jury. Lewis v. State, 452 P.2d 892 (Alaska 1969).

        Oppression will be most acute where a prosecutor deliberately precipitates a mistrial in a case which is going badly in order to allow himself, at a later time, either to present a better case or simply to harass the defendant with another prosecution. Muller v. State, 478 P.2d 822 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        In cases where it is clear that the prosecutor, motivated by a desire to avoid an acquittal in a case which is going badly, engages in purposeful misconduct which forces the court to declare a mistrial, the policy of protecting an accused individual from harassment by consecutive prosecution may demand that a retrial be barred, even though the mistrial was manifestly necessary.

       </p>
       <p>
        In order for prosecutorial misconduct to justify a mistrial, thereby precluding further prosecution, the conduct must be designed to avoid an acquittal when the prosecution’s case is going badly. Torres v. State, 519 P.2d 788 (Alaska 1974); Piesik v. State, 572 P.2d 94 (Alaska 1977).

        Where zeal leads to the introduction of evidence which may stampede the jury to an unproven inference and an unfair verdict, the remedy is a mistrial. Double jeopardy will not prevent a second trial unless the conduct of the state’s attorney is “motivated by a desire to avoid an acquittal in a case which is going badly.” White v. State, 523 P.2d 428 (Alaska 1974).

        , the maximum length of time that defendant was to spend in residential treatment for her alcohol problem as a condition of her probation, the court’s subsequent order setting the maximum length of residential treatment at 90 days constituted an increase in the defendant’s sentence in violation of the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy. An illegal sentence should not be increased unless absolutely necessary to correct the illegality. In this case the illegality should have been corrected by striking the flawed portion of the probation order, i.e., the requirement of residential treatment. Christensen v.

        A court may modify probation to the defendant’s detriment without violating the double jeopardy clause when the applicable statutes authorize the modification, as they do when the court finds that the defendant has violated probation; but, once sentence is meaningfully imposed, a sentencing court does not have the power to alter probation to the defendant’s detriment simply because the court comes to believe that a longer probationary term or more onerous conditions of probation would be better.

        The problem of determining whether two separate statutory violations constitute the same offense cannot be solved by the easy application of a pat mechanical formula, but the problem has to be met so that society’s very basic interest in deterring criminal behavior can be vindicated, and at the same time so that the individual’s constitutional right not to be placed in jeopardy more than once for the same offense can be protected. Whitton v. State, 479 P.2d 302 (Alaska 1970).

       <p>
        Whether separate statutory offenses constitute the same offense for double jeopardy purposes should be determined by focusing upon the quality of the differences, if any exist, between the separate statutory offenses, as such differences relate to the basic interests sought to be vindicated or protected by the statutes.

But if there are no such differences, or if they are insignificant or insubstantial, then only one sentence may be imposed under double jeopardy. Ordinarily the one sentence to be imposed will be based upon or geared to the most grave of the offenses involved, with degrees of gravity being indicated by the different punishments prescribed by the legislature.

        Clearly Alaska law calls for separate convictions and punishments when the victim of the homicide is someone other than the victim of the underlying felony, as when a bystander or a police officer is killed during a robbery; but even when the defendant’s crimes involve only one victim, the Alaska legislature intended to authorize separate convictions and punishments for the underlying felony and the resulting homicide.

        , two things are apparent: first, even in the situation described in the statute (a burglary committed for the purpose of killing someone), when the felony-murder rule does not apply, the legislature still envisioned the defendant might be separately convicted of murder (first-degree murder) or manslaughter and the underlying burglary; second, because the legislature enacted a special provision to merge the two potential offenses in this specific situation, the legislature must have intended that defendants in other felony-murder situations would be subject to conviction and punishment for both the homicide and the underlying felony.

From this it was concluded that since the more serious offense already proscribes and punishes the activity of the less serious offense, the differences between the two offenses must be deemed insubstantial or insignificant in relation to the social interests involved. The result is that the two separate statutory crimes constitute the “same offenses” for purposes of double jeopardy.

        It is concededly improper and reversible error to comment on the failure of a defendant to testify in his own behalf, and the test is whether the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.

        Where challenged statements of a prosecutor in his closing remarks were neither calculated to be, nor of necessity interpreted by the jury as, a comment on appellant’s failure to testify, the circumstance that appellant had not taken the stand could not prohibit the state from commenting on evidence which appellant might have cast doubt on had he testified.

       </p>
       <p>
        Neither the prosecutor’s argument concerning the credibility of defendant’s out-of-court statement nor his ensuing mention of defendant’s right to refrain from testifying amounted to an impermissible comment on defendant’s constitutional right to silence.

        Since a comment on the choice of the accused not to testify could result in an infringement on the accused’s rights, the potential error affects substantial rights, satisfying the requirements for “plain error” so as to permit review of the issue on appeal.

        A prosecutor’s comment, in the rebuttal portion of his closing argument, that the jury should infer guilt from the fact that defendant remained silent between the time of his arrest and the time he was advised of his Miranda rights, a span of about eight minutes, was cognizable under the “plain error” rule embodied in Cr. R. 47(b) and was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Dorman v. State, 622 P.2d 448 (Alaska 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prosecutor’s statement (“I can’t prove what you were thinking unless you come out and tell me yourself”) was not an impermissible comment on defendant’s failure to testify because the prosecutor was responding directly to the defense attorney’s argument that the State had the burden of proving defendant’s “specific intent in his head.”

        Compelling a juvenile to submit to a psychiatric evaluation for the purpose of determining his amenability to treatment as a child was reversible error, where admission of the psychiatric evidence against him at a waiver of juvenile jurisdiction hearing helped to pave the way for the state to prosecute him for murder as an adult, thereby exposing him to potential punishment far more severe than could otherwise have been visited upon him.

        Although there were several problematic aspects of police officer’s renewed interview with defendant in a holding cell after defendant had exercised his right to refuse to answer questions, defendant’s statements were admissible because officer scrupulously honored defendant’s right to cut off questioning since: (1) When the officer came to defendant’s holding cell, he asked defendant for permission to enter, and defendant consented; (2) Even though officer did not repeat the full set of Miranda warnings, defendant was reminded of his right to remain silent; (3) Officer questioned defendant in the same manner as earlier interview, allowing defendant to decide whether he would answer each of officer’s inquiries; and (4) Defendant agreed to that manner of questioning.

        Cross-examination as to defendant’s refusal to give information to police during the investigation of his murder charge, when he testified at trial to those matters, was a permissible attempt to rebut defendant’s testimony as to his cooperativeness and to point out prior inconsistent statements, and did not constitute a prosecutorial comment on his right to remain silent.

       <p>
        Defendant’s silence after arrest upon being asked by friend why he had not reported shooting to police was inconsistent with his pre-arrest statement to another friend that he had called police; thus, defendant’s silence was relevant to establish making of a prior false exculpatory statement and to show inconsistencies in defendant’s statements following the shooting.

       <p>
        Where a parolee is faced with revocation of parole prior to a criminal trial on the same charges, in the interests of fairness, the parolee should not be forced to choose between remaining mute at the revocation proceeding, thereby surrendering his right to present a defense, or testifying at the revocation hearing and incurring the possibility of incriminating himself. McCracken v. Corey, 612 P.2d 990 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a parolee is faced with both revocation and a criminal trial based upon the same conduct, upon timely objection, any evidence or testimony presented by the parolee at his revocation hearing is inadmissible by the state in subsequent criminal proceedings. This exclusionary rule applies equally to the fruits of the parolee’s prior revocation hearing, in order to remove completely any illegitimate incentive to schedule revocation hearings in advance of trial. McCracken v. Corey, 612 P.2d 990 (Alaska 1980).

       <p>
        Where a parolee is faced with both revocation and criminal trial based on the same conduct, the parolee must be advised prior to revocation proceedings that any evidence or testimony offered by him at the revocation proceedings may not be admitted against him at a subsequent trial on the underlying offense.

        Driver, who pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, could assert the privilege against self-incrimination in a civil proceeding because the decision on his pending sentence appeal could require a new sentencing proceeding where his compelled testimony in the civil proceeding could be used to his disadvantage; if the driver's appeal from his sentence was successful, there was a significant possibility that compelled testimony could be considered by a resentencing court.

        Defendants appealing only their sentences, like defendants appealing their convictions, may invoke the privilege against self-incrimination until their convictions become final; therefore, a driver, who pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, could continue to exercise his privilege against self-incrimination during the pendency of his direct appeal.

       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, the no-bail orders were contrary to
        Alaska Const. art. I, § 11 because the superior court erred in resting its assessment of her flight risk on unsubstantiated assertions by the prosecutor; in fact, the prosecutor did not provide an affidavit from any officer showing that defendant was hiding from the authorities. On remand, the superior court was directed to determine the appropriate bail conditions in defendant’s case by taking into account the legislature’s data and research on the efficacy of monetary bail, as well as the concerns about a money-based bail system.

         “Criminal prosecution”

        is defined as including any offense a direct penalty for which may be incarceration in a jail or penal institution; also included in the definition of that term are offenses which may result in the loss of a valuable license and offenses where a heavy enough fine is imposed so as to indicate criminality, because such a fine could be taken as a gauge of the ethical and social judgments of the community.

        The category of “criminal prosecutions” is defined as including any offense a direct penalty for which may be incarceration in a jail or penal institution. It also includes offenses which may result in the loss of a valuable license, such as a driver’s license or a license to pursue a common calling, occupation, or business. It must also include offenses which, even if incarceration is not a possible punishment, still connote criminal conduct in the traditional sense of the term. Baker v.

        The category of “criminal prosecutions” does not cover revocation of licenses pursuant to administrative proceedings where lawful criteria other than criminality are a proper concern in protecting public welfare and safety, as the basis of revocation or suspension in such instances is not that one has committed a criminal offense, but that the individual is not fit to be licensed, apart from considerations of only guilt or innocence of crime.

        The supreme court’s definition of a criminal prosecution has been extended to provide a jury trial in such traditionally noncriminal areas as juvenile proceedings and contempt.

       </p>

        While it is true that a preliminary hearing usually affords the accused an opportunity to learn in advance of trial something of the nature of the evidence upon which the government will rely, its principal function is not that of providing pretrial discovery.

It is not unreasonable to conclude that in many such cases the jury can and will follow the trial judge’s instructions to disregard such information. Sidney v. State, 468 P.2d 960 (Alaska 1970).

       <p>
        It was harmless error for prosecution to cross-examine defense expert on the absence of autopsy slides because defendant had remedies for the error at trial. While the prosecution was improperly allowed to imply that autopsy slides existed, defendant could have presented evidence of standard procedures when tissue samples are created as part of an autopsy. It was reasonable for the defense expert to conclude that, because he had not received any slides, none existed. Garner v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Mar. 30, 2011) (memorandum decision).

        Where a driver was arrested for drunk driving, and the criminal charges were dropped because the arresting officer was deployed to Iraq and would not be available to testify at trial for more than a year, but where the administrative proceedings for the suspension/revocation of the driver’s operating license were not dismissed, the driver’s due process rights were not violated where her license was suspended almost three years after her arrest because administrative delay alone, without prejudice, did not violate due process, and any prejudice to the driver was slight because she was issued a permit that allowed her to drive throughout the delay.

        While the Alaska supreme court must enforce the minimum constitutional standards imposed upon it by the U.S. supreme court’s interpretation of the 14th amendment, it is free, and it is under a duty, to develop additional constitutional rights and privileges under the Alaska Constitution if it finds such fundamental rights and privileges to be within the intention and spirit of local constitutional language and to be necessary for the kind of civilized life and ordered liberty which is at the core of Alaska’s constitutional heritage. The Alaska supreme court need not stand by idly and impassively, waiting for constitutional direction from the highest court of the land. Instead, it should be moving concurrently to develop and expound the principles embedded in Alaska constitutional law. Alexander v. Anchorage, 490 P.2d 910 (Alaska 1971).

        Children are constitutionally entitled to jury trial in the adjudicative stage of a delinquency proceeding. However, due to the uniqueness of some facets of the procedures governing children’s court proceedings and the potential damage which may accrue to the child by a public trial, the child should first consult with his counsel and his parents or guardian when appropriate, and then affirmatively assert the right to a trial by jury before it is finally granted.

        Because minors charged with under-age drinking or possession of alcohol are subject to revocation of their driver’s license upon conviction, if charged with such offense they are entitled to a jury trial and to court-appointed counsel if they are indigent.

        Custodial confinement in a residential alcohol treatment program is the functional equivalent of jail time and therefore constitutes a sentence of imprisonment. Thus, a person who faces custodial in-patient alcohol treatment as a penalty for an offense is entitled to a jury trial and to court-appointed counsel. Likewise, a person facing the possibility of community work service is entitled to these same procedural rights. State v. Auliye, 57 P.3d 711 (Alaska Ct. App. 2002).

        The Alaska Constitution guarantees defendants the right to trial by jury and (if indigent) the right to court-appointed counsel if they are charged with an offense (such as an underage alcohol offense) that carries a potential penalty of: (1) imprisonment; (2) the loss of valuable license (e.g., a driver’s license); or (3) a fine so large as to connote criminality; juvenile offenders facing similar consequences also have the right to trial by jury.

        The speedy trial guarantee fulfills three main purposes: (1) It prevents harming a defendant through a weakening of his case as evidence and witnesses’ memories fade with the passage of time; (2) it prevents prolonged pretrial incarceration; and (3) it limits the infliction of anxiety upon the accused because of long-standing charges.

One is to prevent harming the defendant by a weakening of his case as evidence and memory of witnesses grow stale with the passage of time. Another is to prevent prolonged pretrial incarceration and the infliction of anxiety upon the accused because of long-pending charges. Lastly, it is recognized that harm is inflicted upon an accused who is serving a sentence in another jurisdiction if he is not promptly allowed to be tried in the jurisdiction where charges are still pending. Glasgow v. State, 469 P.2d 682 (Alaska 1970).

        The speedy trial guarantee has been seen as fulfilling at least three purposes: (1) To prevent harming the defendant by a weakening of his case as evidence and memories of witnesses grow stale with the passage of time; (2) to prevent prolonged pretrial incarceration; and (3) to limit the infliction of anxiety upon the accused because of long-standing charges. In postulating speedy trial standards, it is necessary to be cognizant of each of these purposes. Rutherford v. State, 486 P.2d 946 (Alaska 1971).

        The right to a speedy trial serves several purposes, only one of which is concerned with the accuracy of verdicts in criminal trials. The existence of these other purposes, however, in no way diminishes the importance of speedy trial as a guarantee of basic procedural fairness to the accused. Protracted delay in bringing a criminal case to trial may substantially impinge upon the reliability of the fact-finding process.

        In a case where defendant’s counsel stated at the time of the entry of the plea of nolo contendere that it was subject to a reservation of his right to appeal the speedy trial issue, though the prosecutor opposed acceptance of the conditional plea, and the trial judge indicated that he believed defendant’s right to appeal would be preserved, but declined to rule on the matter, since the defendant was not told by the court that the conditional nature of his plea was a nullity and would preserve no appellate rights, the supreme court is constrained to respect the condition. To do otherwise would likely render mean the plea was not intelligently made and was invalid.

        A plea of nolo contendere is a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects. Violation of one’s right to a speedy trial is non-jurisdictional.

This has been done where the prosecutor and the trial court have consented to the conditional nature of the plea, and where they do not consent, but the court failed to advise the defendant that his conditional plea did not preserve his right to appeal.

        S. Ct. 118, 13 L. Ed. 2d 62 (1964), was that the right to speedy trial is a personal right of the accused which may be waived through mere inaction. In light of the supreme court’s present interpretation of the speedy trial provision of the Alaska Constitution and the authorities it has discussed on the issue of waiver of fundamental constitutional rights, it is clear that
        <i>
         Goss v. State
        </i>
        is no longer tenable either in its holding or its underlying theory.
        To the extent that it bears upon the right to speedy trial, Goss is overruled.

       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement of a demand, the showing of prejudicial harm to the defendant’s case, and the implication of a waiver from the defendant’s failure to make a demand arguably are no longer determinative of the claim to a speedy trial. Glasgow v. State, 469 P.2d 682 (Alaska 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the presence of a demand or a showing of prejudice to one’s case can only help the claim, their absence alone will not necessarily frustrate the right to a speedy trial, including the right to a dismissal of the charges with prejudice when there has been a clear denial of this constitutional right. Glasgow v. State, 469 P.2d 682 (Alaska 1970).

         Public trial is an institutional safeguard. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Essentially, the public-trial guarantee embodies a view of human nature, true as a general rule, that judges, lawyers, witnesses, and jurors will perform their respective functions more responsibly in an open court than in secret proceedings. A fair trial is the objective, and “public trial” is an institutional safeguard for attaining it. Thus, the right of “public trial” is not one belonging to the public, but one belonging to the accused, and inhering in the institutional process by which justice is administered. RLR v. State, 487 P.2d 27 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A public trial safeguards against attempts to employ the courts as instruments of persecution, restrains abuse of judicial power, brings the proceedings to the attention of key witnesses not known to the parties, and teaches the spectators about their government and gives them confidence in their judicial remedies. RLR v. State, 487 P.2d 27 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The guarantee of public trials fosters and preserves at least three important societal values; two of these primarily protect a defendant’s right to a fair trial, while the third involves society’s broader interest in preserving social cohesion and the public peace by allowing citizens to assure themselves that justice is being done.

        Exclusion of the general public while testimony was given by three child victims at defendant’s trial for sexual abuse was a “total” closure in the sense that it was closed to all spectators, and reversal of defendant’s conviction was warranted, even in the absence of a specific claim of prejudice flowing from the closure.

        The key question addressed in constitutional challenges to jury selection is whether the prospective jurors were drawn from a fair cross section of the community. Hampton v. State, 569 P.2d 138 (Alaska 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1056, 98 S. Ct. 1225, 55 L. Ed. 2d 757 (U.S. 1978).

       <p>
        Trial court abused its discretion when it refused to delay jury selection until after a storm abated because this violated the right to an impartial jury; the inclement weather prevented a particular contingent of the jury pool from attending court. Because the same inclement weather prevented the State’s primary witnesses from attending court, there would have been little additional delay if the trial court had delayed jury selection.

A prospective juror testifying to an inability to overcome preconceptions shall be subject to challenge for cause no matter how slight the exposure. If the prospective juror remembers information that will be developed in the course of the trial, or that may be inadmissible but does not create a substantial risk of impairing judgment, that person’s acceptability shall turn on the credibility of testimony as to impartiality. If the information of an opinion is admitted, the prospective juror shall be subject to challenge for cause unless the examination shows unequivocally the capacity to be impartial. A prospective juror who has been exposed to and remembers reports of highly significant information, such as the existence or contents of a confession, or other incriminating matters that may be inadmissible in evidence, or substantial amounts of inflammatory material, shall be subject to challenge for cause without regard to the prospective juror’s testimony as to state of mind.

       <p>
        Although trial judge may not deny bail to an accused prior to conviction, he can consider danger to the community as a factor in assessing the amount of bail or fixing the terms of a conditional release. He is in a far better position than an appellate court to assess the evidence and to determine, in the first instance, what alternatives are available, and the amount of bail that should be required. Gilbert v. State, 540 P.2d 485 (Alaska 1975).

        Evidence in bail proceedings to the effect that an accused is a danger to the community has been decreed relevant by the legislature for the purpose of determining either the amount of bail or conditions of release. Carman v. State, 564 P.2d 361 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        On remand, trial court was ordered to reconsider bail for defendant as it could not be discerned from the record why the trial court believed that bail in amounts totaling $ 1,300,000 was the least restrictive bail necessary in light of the otherwise structured and restrictive supervision plan in place; it also did not appear that the trial court meaningfully integrated the consideration of defendant's ability to pay.

        Monetary amount imposed for bail constituted an abuse of discretion because the superior court approved a highly restrictive bail release plan with electronic monitoring, house arrest, and partial third-party custodians; appellant agreed to augment that plan with a $10,000 unsecured appearance bond and a $3,000 cash-only performance bond; it was not clear why imposing an additional $17,000 beyond what appellant's family had the ability to pay would make the community any safer or her bail plan materially more robust; and the superior court was required to impose the least restrictive bail conditions that would reasonably ensure appellant's appearance and the safety of the community.

       <p>

       <p>
        When one is arrested and brought to a jail for a minor offense for which bail has already been set in a bail schedule, he should be given a reasonable opportunity to post bail before being booked and searched. This rule should normally be followed unless exigencies demand a different course of action. Zehrung v. State, 573 P.2d 858 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The ability of an arrestee to obtain a prompt release by posting bail for a petty offense should not depend on the fortuitous circumstance of one having sufficient money on his person to post the bail at the time he arrives at the jail. Many people do not carry much cash on their person. Those persons should be permitted access to a telephone in order to get in touch with a relative, an employer, a friend, or an attorney, who could come to the stationhouse within a reasonable time and put up the necessary bail. Whether circumstances justify a variance will depend on the particular facts involved. Zehrung v. State, 569 P.2d 189 (Alaska 1977).

       <p>
        Where a jail had been provided with a bail schedule for petty offenses, the purpose of which was to afford an arrestee the opportunity to avoid incarceration by posting the established bail without need to appear before a magistrate, if one is arrested for a petty offense and has sufficient funds on his person to post the established bail when brought to the jail facility, he should be released immediately. There is no reason to subject such an arrestee to booking procedures with the resultant inventory search of his person since he is not to be incarcerated. Zehrung v.

        The main and essential purpose of the provision that the accused has the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him is to secure for the accused the right of cross-examination. McBride v. State, 368 P.2d 925 (Alaska 1962), cert. denied, 374 U.S. 811, 83 S. Ct. 1702, 10 L. Ed. 2d 1035 (U.S. 1963).

        The right of confrontation is meant to protect the defendant’s interest in being able to test, by cross-examination, the testimony of those appearing against him. Lanier v. State, 486 P.2d 981 (Alaska 1971); Keith v. State, 612 P.2d 977 (Alaska 1980).

       <p>
        The right to confrontation generally serves to give a defendant charged with crime an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses against him and to advance a practical concern for the accuracy of the truth-determining process in criminal trials by assuring that the trier of fact has a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.

In determining whether “particularized guarantees of trustworthiness” exist, the totality of the circumstances must be considered; however, the relevant circumstances include only those that surround the making of the statement and render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.

        Except pursuant to one of the constitutionally acceptable exceptions to the hearsay rule, the use of out-of-court testimony “would reduce the right of cross-examination guaranteed by the confrontation clause to a nullity.” Blue v. State, 558 P.2d 636 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a murder-arson trial, defendant’s confrontation rights were not violated by the trial court’s admission of hearsay statements of his wife and a third party implicating both defendant and his wife in the crimes. The third-party witness was available at trial for cross-examination; whereas, the recorded statements of the wife possessed guarantees of trustworthiness that satisfied defendant’s confrontation rights.

        The right of confrontation applies not only to witness testimony, but also to other evidence which the prosecution seeks to introduce against the accused. Keith v. State, 612 P.2d 977 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where photographs taken of the location where stolen property was found were not introduced into evidence nor were they utilized at trial nor did the police who took the pictures prepare their testimony from these photographs, the foundation for the confrontation and cross-examination rights, i.e., the utilization or introduction of evidence or the taking of testimony based on that evidence, was not present. Catlett v. State, 585 P.2d 553 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the state did not seek to introduce any evidence of the victim’s character; it was the defense which raised the victim’s possible insanity and potential for violence in the form of the affirmative defenses of justifiable or excusable homicide, defendant’s attempt to introduce a journal kept by the victim did not serve to “confront” any evidence the prosecution was offering.

         The right of confrontation protects two vital interests of defendant.

        First, it guarantees him the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses against him so as to test their sincerity, memory, ability to perceive and relate, and the factual basis of their statements. Second, it enables the defendant to demonstrate to the jury the witness’ demeanor when confronted by the defendant so that the inherent veracity of the witness is displayed in the crucible of the courtrooms.

        Prior testimony given at a hearing where the defendant had the effective right to cross-examine the declarant is admissible at a subsequent trial where the declarant is actually unavailable or is testifying but effective cross-examination is impaired by the declarant’s lack of recollection as to the statement. In these instances, the interest in displaying the declarant’s demeanor to the jury may not be fully protected since the cross-examination does not occur before the jury. Lemon v.

        If a defendant at liberty remains away during his trial, the court may proceed provided it is clearly established that his absence is voluntary.

        Notwithstanding a criminal defendant’s right to be resent “at every stage of the trial” under Criminal Rule 38(a), and the defendant’s right to due process, a trial judge has the authority to hear ex parte a witness’s explanation of his basis for asserting a privilege not to testify.

       <p>
        It seems clear that while an attorney may waive his client’s right to be present in a noncapital case, the waiver is effective only if either: (1) The defendant has given counsel express authority in a knowing and intelligent manner, (2) the defendant is present at the time of the waiver, has clearly been informed of his rights, and remains silent, or (3) the defendant subsequently acquiesces in the proceedings in a knowing and intelligent manner.

        Any argument that the failure of defendant’s counsel to object to the verdict being received in his absence precludes review of that issue on appeal is necessarily included in the larger issue of whether the attorney had the power to expressly waive defendant’s right to be present.

        To allow a substitute counsel to waive a defendant’s right to be present at the return of the verdict was clearly erroneous, where there was no evidence of express authorization or acquiescence by defendant, no evidence of “voluntary absence,” no evidence of a great detriment to the administration of justice, and no reasonable basis for a “trial strategy” argument.

       <p>
        In light of the constitutional mandate of defendant’s personal waiver, waiver by defendant’s attorney of defendant’s presence during the playback of testimony to the jury was ineffective, and since the defendant did not effectively waive his presence, it was constitutional error for the judge to communicate with the jury or permit the playback of testimony in defendant’s absence.

        Compulsory process relates to obtaining both witnesses and documentary evidence in the accused’s favor and is intended to ensure a fair trial even when the accused is indigent, but it is normally a right associated with pretrial discovery. Keith v. State, 612 P.2d 977 (Alaska 1980).

        While the constitutional provisions speak of compulsory process for “obtaining witnesses” in a defendant’s favor, this clause has been construed as applying as well to documentary evidence.

        Disclosure is required if the judge’s in camera inspection shows that the material is relevant to the defense — whether or not the prosecutor has demonstrated that discovery will be inconsistent with enforcement or protection efforts.

       <p>
        Defense counsel must perform at least as well as a lawyer with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law and must conscientiously protect his client’s interest, undeflected by conflicting considerations. Risher v. State, 523 P.2d 421 (Alaska 1974); Winkler v. State, 580 P.2d 1167 (Alaska 1978); Morgan v. State, 582 P.2d 1017 (Alaska 1978); Coleman v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Lawyers may display a wide spectrum of ability and still have their performance fall within the range of competence displayed by one of ordinary training and skill in the criminal law. It is only when the ability is below the nadir of that range that it may be held to constitute a deprivation of effective assistance of counsel. Risher v. State, 523 P.2d 421 (Alaska 1974); Coleman v. State, 621 P.2d 869 (Alaska 1980), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1090, 102 S. Ct. 653, 70 L. Ed. 2d 628 (U.S. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        All that is required of counsel is that his decisions, when viewed in the framework of trial pressures, be within the range of reasonable actions which might have been taken by an attorney skilled in the criminal law, regardless of the outcome of such decisions. Risher v. State, 523 P.2d 421 (Alaska 1974); Winkler v. State, 580 P.2d 1167 (Alaska 1978); Coleman v. State, 621 P.2d 869 (Alaska 1980), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1090, 102 S. Ct. 653, 70 L.

       </p>
       <p>
        The following test has been suggested to determine whether an accused has been accorded effective assistance of counsel: Whether counsel exhibited the normal and customary degree of skill possessed by attorneys who are fairly skilled in the criminal law and who have a fair amount of experience at the criminal bar.

        The defendant is not entitled to error-free representation. Nor will the court second guess trial counsel on the basis of hindsight. All that is required is that counsel’s representation fall within the range of reasonable actions which might have been taken by an attorney reasonably skilled in the criminal law, regardless of the outcome. Brown v. State, 601 P.2d 221 (Alaska 1979).

        It is not enough for defendant to show that defense counsel could have done certain things. The standard is whether, at the time counsel made his decision, the judgment fell below a minimum level of competence. Brown v. State, 601 P.2d 221 (Alaska 1979).

Secondly, there must be a showing that the lack of competency contributed to the conviction. Risher v. State, 523 P.2d 421 (Alaska 1974); Coleman v.

        Henceforth the court of appeals will not entertain claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal unless the defendant has first moved for a new trial or sought post-conviction relief, supporting the claim with affidavits alleging facts which would establish a basis for relief. If defendant’s affidavits establish a prima facie case of ineffective assistance of counsel, the state must then be given an opportunity to file counteraffidavits; if material factual conflicts exist or the state requests an opportunity to cross-examine defendant’s witnesses then an evidentiary hearing should be held. To the extent that Alaska Cr. R. 33 places unreasonable time limitations on the presentation of this issue, the trial court should exercise its discretion pursuant to Cr. R. 53 to provide reasonable time. Barry v. State, 675 P.2d 1292 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984).

        Where it did not appear that defendant moved for a new trial or sought post-conviction relief in the trial court, the court of appeals therefore declined to consider his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at that time; however, since the appeal was filed prior to publication of the Barry decision (

        Waiver of counsel must be made with an apprehension of the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to the charges and circumstances of mitigation thereof and all other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter. Gregory v. State, 550 P.2d 374 (Alaska 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        To insure that all defendants enjoy the right to counsel, it must be clear from the record that the person has been informed of the role of a defense attorney and the advantages of being represented by one in a criminal proceeding. Only after this information is placed before the accused can it be said that he has the capacity, in a legal sense, to make a knowledgeable waiver of his right to counsel. Gregory v. State, 550 P.2d 374 (Alaska 1976); Swensen v. Municipality of Anchorage, 616 P.2d 874 (Alaska 1980).

       <p>
        Once it appears that an accused intends to waive the right to the assistance of counsel, the trial court must take the additional steps to determine that the accused fully understands the right he is relinquishing. The degree of inquiry necessary should be tailored to the particular characteristics of the accused, such as his lack of education or language disability, and to the complexities of the legal issues raised by the charge against him. In many cases, this duty will be minimal. For instance, traffic misdemeanor cases are usually readily understood by lay persons and the consequences of a finding of guilt are typically not severe. O'Dell v. Municipality of Anchorage, 576 P.2d 104 (Alaska 1978); Swensen v. Municipality of Anchorage, 616 P.2d 874 (Alaska 1980); Williams v. State, 616 P.2d 881 (Alaska 1980).

       <p>
        Regarding the right of self-representation and the need to avoid perverting the judicial process, a trial judge should satisfy himself that the prisoner understands precisely what he is giving up by declining the assistance of counsel. Criminal Rule 39(b)(3) provides that, at the trial stage, counsel should be appointed unless the defendant “demonstrates that he understands the benefits of counsel and knowingly waives the same.”

       <p>
        Where the record is devoid of an inquiry into the defendant’s comprehension of the benefits of counsel and, in short, fails to demonstrate a knowing and intelligent waiver by defendant of the right to assistance of counsel, defendant’s conviction must be set aside and a new trial ordered. O'Dell v. Municipality of Anchorage, 576 P.2d 104 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order for there to be a constitutional waiver of the right to counsel, the trial judge must satisfy himself that the defendant is capable of presenting his case in a rational and coherent manner and that the defendant understands the benefit he is giving up by foregoing legal counsel.

       <p>
        Before accepting a defendant’s waiver of counsel and his election to proceed pro se, it was incumbent on the superior court to inquire into more than just his intelligence, background and general competency to present his case. The court was additionally obligated to advise the defendant of the right to counsel and the importance of having counsel, in order to ensure that the defendant understood “precisely what he was giving up by declining the assistance of counsel.” Beyond that, the court was required to make the defendant aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record would have established that he knew what he was doing and his choice was made with eyes open.

        An appointed lawyer’s conclusory assurance at the outset of the waiver hearing that he had discussed with the defendant what a lawyer could do for him and that the defendant understood was not an adequate substitute for a detailed, on-record explanation of the benefits of counsel.

         A proceeding under Cr. R. 5 before a judge on the day after a defendant’s arrest

        is not a “critical stage” requiring the assistance of counsel. No plea may be taken at that stage, and the probable cause determination made pursuant to subsection (e)(1) of the rule neither involves the examination of witnesses nor precludes the state from seeking a grand jury indictment should no probable cause be found. Furthermore, at the preliminary examination, which must follow within 10 days if the defendant is in custody, probable cause is determined de novo, and the defendant is assured the presence of counsel.

       State prisoner was entitled to bring constitutional claims under this section against a private correction company and its employees because the State of Alaska owed legal duties which were incorporated by reference into the contract between the state and the company; thus, the prisoner was an intended beneficiary of the contract between the state and the company.

      <p>
       The judiciary of this state and that section of the executive branch which administers the penal system (i.e., the division of corrections, Department of Health and Social Services), are constrained by the Alaska Constitution to base penal administration “on the principal of reformation and upon the need for protecting the public.” These principles are the “touchstones of penal administration.”

        Multiple goals encompassed. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Alaska’s constitution, the principles of reformation and necessity of protecting the public constitute the touchstones of penal administration. Multiple goals encompassed within these broad constitutional standards include rehabilitation of the offender into a noncriminal member of society, isolation of the offender from society to prevent criminal conduct during the period of confinement, deterrence of the offender himself after his release from confinement or other penological treatment, as well as deterrence of other members of the community who might possess tendencies toward criminal conduct similar to that of the offender, and community condemnation of the individual offender, or in other words, reaffirmation of societal norms for the purpose of maintaining respect for the norms themselves. State v. Chaney, 477 P.2d 441 (Alaska 1970); Nicholas v. State, 477 P.2d 447 (Alaska 1970); Deveroux v. State, 548 P.2d 1296 (Alaska 1976); Layland v. State, 549 P.2d 1182 (Alaska 1976); Godwin v. State, 554 P.2d 453 (Alaska 1976); Abraham v. State, 585 P.2d 526 (Alaska 1978); Kelly v. State, 622 P.2d 432 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The twin goals of penal administration in Alaska are reformation of the offender and the need to protect the public. Mattern v. State, 500 P.2d 228 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Within the ambit of this section are found the objectives of rehabilitation of the offender into a noncriminal member of society, isolation of the offender from society to prevent criminal conduct during the period of confinement, deterrence of the offender himself after his release from confinement or other penological treatment, as well as deterrence of other members of the community who might possess tendencies toward criminal conduct similar to that of the offender, and community condemnation of the individual offender, or, in other words, reaffirmation of societal norms for the purpose of maintaining respect for the norms themselves. Galaktionoff v. State, 486 P.2d 919 (Alaska 1971); Newsom v. State, 533 P.2d 904 (Alaska 1975); Holloway v. State, 535 P.2d 467 (Alaska 1975); Andrews v. State, 552 P.2d 150 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       In implementing this provision, the supreme court has recognized the following goals of criminal sanctions: 1. Rehabilitation of the convicted offender into a noncriminal member of society. 2. Isolation of the offender from society to prevent criminal conduct during the period of confinement. 3. Deterrence of other members of the community who might have tendencies toward criminal conduct similar to those of the offender. 4. Deterrence of the offender himself after release. 5. Community condemnation or reaffirmation of societal norms for the purpose of maintaining respect for the norms themselves. Asitonia v. State, 508 P.2d 1023 (Alaska 1973); Perrin v. State, 543 P.2d 413 (Alaska 1975); Cleary v. State, 548 P.2d 952 (Alaska 1976); Benefield v. State, 559 P.2d 91 (Alaska 1977); Bragg v. State, 560 P.2d 391 (Alaska 1977); Walton v. State, 568 P.2d 981 (Alaska 1977); Ripley v. State, 590 P.2d 48 (Alaska 1979); Brookins v. State, 600 P.2d 12 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the trial court in sentencing a defendant convicted of second degree murder considered (1) the nature and seriousness of the crime, (2) the need to rehabilitate defendant, (3) the need to protect society through isolating him, (4) the deterrent effect of the sentence both on defendant and others in the community, and (5) the effect of the sentence as a reaffirmation of societal norms, and where the trial court properly evaluated the information before it concerning defendant’s alcoholism and his need for training and supervision in financial affairs, the supreme court held that the trial court had properly evaluated his role in the sentencing process. Asitonia v. State, 508 P.2d 1023 (Alaska 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       The factors to be considered in sentencing are rehabilitation of the offender into a noncriminal member of society, isolation of the offender from society to prevent criminal conduct during the period of confinement, deterrence of the offender himself after his release from confinement or other penological treatment, as well as deterrence of other members of the community who might possess tendencies toward criminal conduct similar to that of the offender, and community condemnation of the individual offender, or in other words, reaffirmation of societal norms for the purpose of maintaining respect for the norms themselves. Smothers v. State, 579 P.2d 1062 (Alaska 1978); Christie v. State, 580 P.2d 310 (Alaska 1978); Sumabat v. State, 580 P.2d 323 (Alaska 1978); Hansen v. State, 582 P.2d 1041 (Alaska 1978); Wharton v. State, 590 P.2d 427 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       In regard to the purposes of sentencing, one of the goals to be achieved is “rehabilitation of the convicted offender into a noncriminal member of society.” Collins v. State, 574 P.2d 1278 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       In
       <i>
        State v. Chaney
       </i>
       , 477 P.2d 441 (1970), the supreme court has identified four sentencing goals: Rehabilitation of the offender, isolation of the offender from society, deterrence of the offender after his release and of others disposed to commit similar acts, and community condemnation of the offender because of his acts.
       Post v. State, 580 P.2d 304 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Among the multiple goals encompassed within the broad constitutional standards of sentencing is the objective of rehabilitation of the offender into a noncriminal member of society. Morgan v. State, 582 P.2d 1030 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The sentencing goals to be considered by a judge in determining an appropriate sentence for a particular offense include not only rehabilitation of the offender, but in addition, isolation of the offender in order to protect the public, deterrence of the offender and of other members of the community who might possess similar criminal tendencies and reaffirmation of societal norms embodying condemnation of the unlawful acts performed by the guilty person. Huff v. State, 568 P.2d 1014 (Alaska 1977); Bordewick v. State, 569 P.2d 184 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Important goals of sentencing to be considered are isolation of the offender from society to prevent criminal conduct, future deterrence of the offender himself, deterrence of other members of the community, and community condemnation of the individual offender, or in other words, reaffirmation of societal norms for the purpose of maintaining respect for the norms themselves. Brandon v. State, 581 P.2d 1116 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Rehabilitation of the offender is an important goal to be achieved for the benefit of society and because it is a recognition of the intrinsic worth and the inherent dignity of man. State v. Lancaster, 550 P.2d 1257 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Equally important in the imposition of sanctions is the need to recognize and express community condemnation of the offender’s antisocial conduct. State v. Lancaster, 550 P.2d 1257 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The supreme court has repeatedly required the sentencing judge to consider, on the record, various goals or objectives to be achieved in sentencing, including among other factors the reformation or rehabilitation of the offender. Abraham v. State, 585 P.2d 526 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon passing sentence, the trial court must give consideration to the goals of rehabilitation, isolation of the offender, deterrence of the offender and others criminally inclined and community condemnation of the offender. Shagloak v. State, 582 P.2d 1034 (Alaska 1978), vacated, 597 P.2d 142 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal of rehabilitation is a touchstone of penal administration and is mandated by this section. Shagloak v. State, 582 P.2d 1034 (Alaska 1978), vacated, 597 P.2d 142 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       While rehabilitation is certainly one of the primary goals of sentencing, a court is not required to fashion a sentence to provide for rehabilitation if it finds that the potential for rehabilitation is nonexistent within the time constraints of the penalty for a particular offense. Bell v. State, 598 P.2d 908 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The possibility of rehabilitation must be considered in every case. However, it need not be given the highest priority as a sentencing goal in all cases. The Alaska Constitution places equal emphasis upon protection of the public. Nelson v. State, 619 P.2d 480 (Alaska Ct. App. 1980).

      </p>
      <p>
       Where an Alaska prisoner challenged his transfer to Arizona on the grounds that it violated his right to rehabilitation under this section by denying him visitation with his family and alcohol treatment, the issue became moot when the Court of Appeals resentenced him and he was returned to custody in Alaska.

       Given the unusual dual coverage of defendant by electronic monitoring and a third party custodian if released on bail, it was not clear what purpose setting the bail above his ability to pay served; trial court was to reassess the monetary component once it approved a third-party custodian, and if the court continued to believe that the monetary bail should be set outside defendant's ability to pay, particularized findings as to why were required.

       Monetary amount imposed for bail constituted an abuse of discretion because the superior court approved a highly restrictive bail release plan with electronic monitoring, house arrest, and partial third-party custodians; appellant agreed to augment that plan with a $10,000 unsecured appearance bond and a $3,000 cash-only performance bond; it was not clear why imposing an additional $17,000 beyond what appellant's family had the ability to pay would make the community any safer or her bail plan materially more robust; and the superior court was required to impose the least restrictive bail conditions that would reasonably ensure appellant's appearance and the safety of the community.

       In a second-degree sexual assault case, defendant’s constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment was not violated by the imposition of a 99-year presumptive sentence because defendant sexually assaulted a woman while she was incapacitated and unaware of what was happening, and he later exhibited no remorse for his conduct. He had prior convictions for similar offenses, he did not reform his behavior, he did not address his alcohol problem, and he had numerous misdemeanor offenses.

       Combination of the automatic waiver statute and the adult sentencing statute was consistent with evolving standards of decency and this scheme bore a fair and substantial relationship to the legitimate purposes of punishment; the sentencing judge gave the minor defendant’s rehabilitative prospects careful scrutiny and appropriate weight and the resulting sentence for first-degree murder was not clearly mistaken.

      <p>
       Court of Appeals of the State of Alaska did not apply the proper two-stage probation revocation hearing process because the court should have made a finding of fact regarding whether the probationer violated a condition of probation, and, if the probationer did violate a condition of probation, the court then should have determined the proper disposition given the violation. The probationer's mental state at the time of the violation as well as at the time of the revocation hearing and a good cause determination were part of the second stage. State v. Falealo Manuele Pulusila, 467 P.3d 211 (Alaska 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a probation officer alleged that a probationer was in possession of certain prohibited items after the probationer was found in a truck with those items, because the appropriate mens rea requirement for possession of items prohibited by a condition of probation was a negligence standard, not an actual knowledge standard, the State of Alaska had to prove that the probationer knew or should have known that he was in possession of items prohibited by a condition of probation. The superior court on remand was to make this determination. State v. Falealo Manuele Pulusila, 467 P.3d 211 (Alaska 2020).

       <p>
        Based on Alaska Const. art. I, §§ 14, 22, and the highly personal information that can be revealed by a garbage search, a person who sets out garbage for routine collection on or adjacent to a public street or a public area has some objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in that garbage.

        When an individual has taken reasonable steps to protect their house and curtilage from ground-level observation, he has a reasonable expectation that law enforcement will not use a telephoto lens or other visual enhancement technology to engage in aerial surveillance of the individual's residential property for the purpose of investigating criminal activity; in such circumstances, the aerial surveillance constitutes a search and requires a warrant unless there is an applicable exception.

       <p>
        Because defendant had taken reasonable measures to protect the privacy of his residential curtilage from ground-level observation, and because the officer used a telephoto lens during his aerial surveillance of defendant's property to obtain an enhanced view of the greenhouse located within his curtilage, the trooper's investigative overflight was a search that required a warrant; as there was no warrant and no exception to the warrant requirement, the superior court should have granted defendant's motion to suppress.

       <p>

         Meaning of “search.” —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The term “search” implies some exploratory investigation or an invasion and quest, a looking for or seeking out. The quest may be secret, intrusive or accomplished by force, and it has been held that a search implies some sort of force, either actual or constructive, much or little. A search implies a prying into hidden places for that which is concealed and that the object searched for has been hidden or intentionally put out of the way. While it has been said that ordinarily searching is a function of sight, it is generally held that the mere looking at that which is open to view is not a “search.” Brown v. State, 372 P.2d 785 (Alaska 1962); McGee v. State, 614 P.2d 800 (Alaska 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 967, 101 S. Ct. 1485, 67 L. Ed. 2d 617 (U.S. 1981).

        It is well settled that an officer’s observation of things in plain view made from a place where he has a right to be does not constitute a search in the constitutional sense. Conversely, when observations are made from an area to which the officer has not been expressly or impliedly invited, the intrusion is an unlawful search unless made pursuant to a warrant or one of the established exceptions to the warrant requirement.

        The duty police officer who responds to an emergency call and discovers a homicide is not necessarily a competent officer to conduct the type of investigation necessary to protect the interests of society. This is particuarly the case with respect to a small frontier village. Stevens v. State, 443 P.2d 600 (Alaska 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1039, 89 S. Ct. 662, 21 L. Ed. 2d 586 (U.S. 1969).

        In a populous area the officer discovering a homicide could remain at the scene until trained investigators arrived to conduct an investigation. In that situation the presence of the officer making the legal entry would continue until summoned investigators arrived. Only minutes or possibly no more than an hour or two would ordinarily elapse between the legal entry and the commencement of the police investigation of the homicide. Stevens v.

       <p>
        Assuming the unconstitutionality of a search, the exclusionary rule would prohibit the use of both primary and derivative evidence gained from that search. However, derivative evidence is not sacred and inaccessible. If it is gained from an independent source or has become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint, it may be admissible. Cruse v. State, 584 P.2d 1141 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The exclusionary rule extends only to those facts which were actually discovered through a direct process initiated by the unlawful act. Where the disputed evidence stems from an independent and lawful source, even though it could have emerged from the prior unlawful search as well, the evidence is admissible. Cruse v. State, 584 P.2d 1141 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress because the exclusionary rule did not apply to evidence obtained as a result of a mental health counselor's disclosure to authorities of defendant's use of child pornography since the police did not engage the counselor as their agent; the counselor could have violated professional or ethical rules against disclosure of confidential patient information, but any lapse was not an outgrowth of state action.

         Expectation of privacy as to trash. —

       <p>
        A review of several recent garbage can search cases reveals a basic core of factors to be considered in determining whether a reasonable expectation of privacy exists. These factors are: 1. Where the trash is located, 2. whether the dwelling is multiple or single unit, 3. who removed the trash, and 4. where the search of the trash takes place. Smith v. State, 510 P.2d 793 (Alaska), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1086, 94 S. Ct. 603, 38 L. Ed. 2d 489 (U.S. 1973).

         Factors readily form a continuum.

        At one end of the continuum is trash located close to a single-family dwelling, on the same property as the dwelling, and searched by police officers at that location. The supreme court observes, without so deciding, that this would be a strong case for holding the expectation of privacy to be reasonable. At the other end of the continuum is trash located off the premises of a multiple-unit dwelling, and searched by a person authorized to remove it. In such a case the supreme court would be unable to hold that the expectation of privacy was reasonable. Smith v. State, 510 P.2d 793 (Alaska), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1086, 94 S. Ct. 603, 38 L.

        Where, after he discovered cocaine powder in a package supposedly containing T-shirts, an airlines employee called the police and when the investigator arrived, removed a T-shirt from the box and showed the investigator the plastic bag containing the powder, and where the investigator then took the bag and tested the powder, this inspection was permissible and the subsequent seizure of the powder justifiable, because there is no indication the inspection was done at the direction of the police, nor was there an attempt by the officer to open the original package since the investigator was handed a T-shirt from a box opened by the airlines employee, and the powder contained in plastic bags was pointed out to him. No police search had occurred up until this time. There was no “prying into hidden places for that which is concealed” by the officer, and thus the contraband was in plain view. State v. Stump, 547 P.2d 305 (Alaska 1976).

        Although the police had advised the airline employees as to the latter’s right to search, and the airline employee in question had previously discovered drugs and cooperated with law enforcement officials, but the police had not requested a specific search of defendant’s package or participated in the initial discovery of the contraband, the employee’s conduct in opening the package, received under circumstances reasonably arousing suspicion, did not constitute governmental activity. Snyder v. State, 585 P.2d 229 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        Although there was nothing about the packages themselves that aroused suspicion, nor was the physical appearance of the consignor out of the ordinary, where the airline employee thought the consignor might have been under the influence of something due to the consignor’s repetitive speech, exaggerated gesticulation, scribbled handwriting, possibly dilated eyes, and general nervousness, the airline employee had reasonable and articulable suspicions that the articles might be something other than what was declared. Thus, the employee’s intrusion in opening the packages was justified by the presence of a legitimate airline purpose: Verification of the contents of the boxes. McConnell v. State, 595 P.2d 147 (Alaska), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 918, 100 S. Ct. 235, 62 L. Ed. 2d 173 (U.S. 1979).

       <p>
        Where the initial opening of the package was performed by an airline employee without instigation from a government official and for a legitimate airline purpose, once the suspicious contents of the package had been observed by that employee, it was permissible to reshow the contents to an Alyeska Pipeline Security employee, even assuming arguendo that the security employee was a governmental official or agent at the time the package was reopened. Such a reshowing did not constitute a search by the Alyeska Pipeline Security employee, where he did not know that the package had been previously opened, he did not suggest that the package be opened until he was advised that it could be legally opened by the airline personnel, and he remained a passive observer of the contents of the package. Stange v. State, 559 P.2d 650 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an airline employee’s search, which discovered a baggie containing a white substance, was valid, it follows that a police officer’s seizure of the package, in light of his narcotics experience and the sender’s misrepresentations concerning the contents of the package, was valid under the “plain view” doctrine since the baggie containing white powder was not “an apparently innocuous object.” Whittemore v.

        To impose the same requirements on the arrest of a parolee as are otherwise mandated for an arrest including an affidavit or sworn complaint would have constituted meaningless additional time and effort on the part of parole officers.

         Right to search as condition of release on parole. —

       </p>
       <p>
        Depending on the nature of the crime involved, a condition of release granting authorities the right to search premises and persons at reasonable times could stand muster under both the Alaska and federal constitutions. Released offenders subject to searches and seizures conducted pursuant to such conditions would be protected from undue harassment by the limitations of due process. Roman v. State, 570 P.2d 1235 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the supreme court does not believe that a released offender has voluntarily consented to all conditions of parole and it likewise rejects the custody rationale under which a released offender was regarded as constitutionally entitled to no more rights than he would have enjoyed if incarcerated, it recognizes that conditioning release on some forms of search by correctional authority is both consistent with the goal of rehabilitation and necessary for the proper functioning of the parole system. To this extent, parolees have a diminished expectation of privacy. Roman v. State, 570 P.2d 1235 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Warrantless searches of parolees or probationers and their residences should not be countenanced unless there is a direct relationship of the searches to the nature of the crime for which the parolee was convicted.

        The goals of rehabilitation of the individual and protection of the public do not require that a parolee be subject to searches in a manner different from other persons. Roman v. State, 570 P.2d 1235 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was convicted of possession of heroin, the right to request specimens for urinalysis and to search him and his quarters at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner to assure that he would not continue to possess illegal drugs was necessary to the proper functioning of the parole system; and where the right to perform such searches was limited to parole officers and peace officers acting under their direction, the parole authorities were not clearly mistaken in authorizing the search and in conducting it. Further, where defendant’s inability to furnish a specimen for urinalysis prevented use of that means of ascertaining whether he was using drugs, in view of his imminent departure, it was reasonable to search his person at that time. Roman v. State, 570 P.2d 1235 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was improper for the superior court to condition the probation of a defendant convicted for burglary on the requirement that he submit to a warrantless search, upon the request of a probation officer, for the presence of narcotics or dangerous drugs, since defendant was not accused of any drug offenses, nor was it shown that he was addicted to drugs or that his involvement in the burglary was precipitated by a need for money to purchase illegal drugs.

         Neutral and detached magistrate. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The amount of time spent in reviewing the affidavit for a search warrant is not by itself controlling of the magistrate’s neutral and detached manner. Since the purpose of requiring that warrants be issued by a neutral and detached magistrate is to assure that the inference of probable cause is drawn by a person who is not in a position to be influenced by personal or professional motives, what is required of that person is severance and disengagement from activities of law enforcement. Johnson v. State, 617 P.2d 1117 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a presumption that a judicial officer acts in a neutral and detached manner when he issues a warrant, and a magistrate does not lose his neutral and detached character merely because he leaves his regular office in order to make himself readily available to law enforcement officers who may wish to seek the issuance of warrants by him. Johnson v. State, 617 P.2d 1117 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an officer had a short period of time in which to secure a warrant, in light of the exigencies of the situation, it was not improper for a magistrate to meet the officer at a parking lot near the airport where the subject matter of the search was to be picked up by the suspect.

       </p>
       <p>
        The question of whether an affidavit contains sufficient facts to establish probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant is a question of constitutional stature; it is imperative that a magistrate be presented with adequate supporting facts, rather than mere affirmations of suspicion or belief.

        An anticipatory search warrant is one which is based upon an affidavit showing probable cause that at some future time — but not presently — certain evidence will be at the location set forth in the warrant.

        (3), which requires only reasonable belief of possession of the item for issuance of the warrant, without specifying that possession must be contemporaneous with the issuance, as distinct from the execution, of the warrant. Johnson v. State, 617 P.2d 1117 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        For an anticipatory warrant to be valid, there must be probable cause to believe that the items to be seized will be at the place to be searched at the time the warrant is executed, or in other words, that the warrant will not be prematurely executed. Johnson v. State, 617 P.2d 1117 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        In anticipatory warrant situations, the magistrate should insert a direction in the search warrant making execution contingent on the happening of an event which evidences probable cause that the item to be seized is in the place to be searched, rather than directing that the warrant be executed immediately or forthwith. Johnson v. State, 617 P.2d 1117 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Just as anticipatory warrants based on probable cause are constitutionally permissible as long as the evidence creates a substantial probability that the seizable property will be on the premises when searched, such a warrant may be issued where positivity as required by Cr. R. 37(a)(3)(iv) is the standard. Johnson v. State, 617 P.2d 1117 (Alaska 1980).

        A nighttime search is a more extreme intrusion than one conducted in the daytime and under Cr. R. 37(a)(3)(iv), providing that warrants be served between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. unless the affiant is positive the property is at the place to be searched; the householder is entitled to the assurance that the judge issuing the warrant has decided that the facts presented in the affidavit justify a nighttime search. Johnson v. State, 617 P.2d 1117 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        In approaching questions of whether a warrant should be issued for a search after 10:00 p.m., the decision of the judicial officer who has issued the warrant is to be given great deference and the resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants. Johnson v. State, 617 P.2d 1117 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The language in Cr. R. 37(a)(3)(iv) that a search warrant shall not be served after 10:00 p.m. unless “an affiant is positive that the property is on the person or in the place to be searched” must be construed to equate “positive” with being reasonably certain. Johnson v. State, 617 P.2d 1117 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement of positivity expressed in Cr. R. 37(a)(3)(iv) is met where the affidavit is explicit and detailed, the ultimate source of the information was said to be one of the persons to whom the warrant was directed and the informant who conveyed it was said to be reliable, and further, the circumstances concerning the shipment of the package which was the subject of the warrant were detailed and suspicious, and corroborated the information conveyed by the informant.

         “Particular description” requirement. —

       <p>
        The “particular description” requirement protects against the evil of the general warrant. State v. Davenport, 510 P.2d 78 (Alaska 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement that warrants particularly describe the things to be seized was designed to prevent general exploratory searches of a person’s belongings. State v. Davenport, 510 P.2d 78 (Alaska 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        The object of the clause of the 4th amendment requiring particularity in regard to the article to be seized under a search warrant is to prevent overbroad generalized searches and seizures. Bell v. State, 482 P.2d 854 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement that warrants particularly describe the items which are to be seized renders general searches under them impossible and prevents the seizure, with several specific exceptions, of one thing under a warrant describing another. Anderson v. State, 555 P.2d 251 (Alaska 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Characterization of property as having been stolen at given time or from given place will not normally suffice to satisfy the requirement of particularity, since such characterization does not enhance an officer’s ability to distinguish between property unlawfully held that is subject to seizure and property of the same general class that is lawfully held and not subject to seizure. Namen v. State, 665 P.2d 557 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Law enforcement officers and judges should exercise great care in drafting and ratifying a search warrant's description of the things to be searched, particularly searches of digital computing and storage devices, where the likelihood of the seizure of innocent articles by mistake is the most substantial.

       <p>
        Where the nature of the property or the facts involved in a specific case preclude detailed description, unrealistic standards cannot properly be applied; the amount of particularity that is required must be determined with practicality and common sense.

       </p>
       <p>
        Generic reference to jewelry in the warrant did not constitute a description that was reasonably specific where an itemized list detailing the property stolen in the burglary had been prepared and was available when the warrant was applied for and issued, and there were no circumstances excusing the need for a particular description.

       <p>
        Although the text of a supporting affidavit or an itemized inventory of property may properly be incorporated by reference in a warrant, incorporation of an extrinsic document must be formally reflected in the warrant; the warrant must, on its face, refer to the extrinsic document that it purports to incorporate, and the intent to incorporate the document must be stated. In addition, a copy of the document incorporated normally must be attached to the warrant, or, at the very least, the warrant must direct that the extrinsic document accompany it at the time of execution.

        An officer may seize evidence of a crime even though such property is not particularly described in the search warrant when the objects discovered and seized are reasonably related to the offense in question, when the searching officer at the time of the seizure has a reasonable basis for drawing a connection between the observed objects and the crime which furnished the basis for the search warrant, and the discovery of such property is made in the course of a good faith search conducted within the authorized perimeters of the search warrant. Bell v. State, 482 P.2d 854 (Alaska 1971); State v. Davenport, 510 P.2d 78 (Alaska 1973); Anderson v. State, 555 P.2d 251 (Alaska 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no logical or constitutional reason, given a lawful entry pursuant to a search warrant by an officer who is conducting a good faith search, why the officer conducting the search should be prohibited from seizing evidence not described in the search warrant where the searching officer has a reasonable basis for drawing a connection between the observed evidentiary objects and the crime which formed the basis of the search warrant. Bell v. State, 482 P.2d 854 (Alaska 1971).

       <p>
        The supreme court has upheld the seizure of an item that had not been described in the search warrant, but which the executing officer had probable cause to believe was related to another crime being conducted in his presence. Thus, the items seized need not necessarily be connected to the crime which served as a basis for the search warrant. State v. Davenport, 510 P.2d 78 (Alaska 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, once an otherwise lawful search is in progress, the police inadvertently come upon a piece of evidence, it would often be a needless inconvenience, and sometimes dangerous — to the evidence or to the police themselves — to require them to ignore it until they have obtained a warrant particularly describing it.

Where the circumstances gave rise to a reasonable inference that the officers had stumbled upon stolen goods, the officers had probable cause to believe that the property was stolen. Deal v. State, 626 P.2d 1073 (Alaska 1980).

        Searches have been upheld even though the nexus between the items to be seized and the place to be searched was based not on direct observation, as in the usual search and seizure case, but on other factors, including the type of crime, the nature of the items enumerated in the search warrant, the extent of the suspect’s opportunity for concealment, and normal inferences as to where a criminal would be likely to hide the property sought.

        Defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment and Alaska Constitution were preserved because although the search warrants did not prescribe an explicit search protocol, the detectives employed a search tool that was designed specifically to identify child pornography; the search warrant was not specific to defendant but was based on probable cause to believe that someone was downloading child pornography at the residence associated with the IP address.

        In its purest application the plain view doctrine does not deal with a search in a constitutional sense but simply sanctions the admission of evidence consisting solely of testimony as to the observations of an officer legally in the position from which the observations were made.

       <p>
        Three basic requirements for a valid “plain view” seizure of evidence are: (1) The initial intrusion which afforded the view must have been lawful; (2) the discovery of the evidence must have been inadvertent; and (3) the incriminating nature of the evidence must have been immediately apparent. Reeves v. State, 599 P.2d 727 (Alaska 1979).

       <p>
        <b>
         The rationale of the plain view exception
        </b>
        to the warrant requirement is that a plain view seizure will not turn an initially valid (and therefore limited) search into a “general” one, while the inconvenience of procuring a warrant to cover an inadvertent discovery is great. But where the discovery is anticipated, where the police know in advance the location of the evidence and intend to seize it, the situation is altogether different. State v. Davenport, 510 P.2d 78 (Alaska 1973).

        The extension of the original justification for an intrusion is legitimate only where it is immediately apparent to the police that they have evidence before them; the plain view doctrine may not be used to extend a general exploratory search from one object to another until something incriminating at last emerges.

        The requirement that the incriminating nature of property be “immediately apparent,” so as to allow its seizure under the “plain view” exception to the warrant requirement means only that the officer must have probable cause to believe the property is stolen, so as to be subject to seizure.

        The supreme court rejected the argument that the necessity of assembling the property and tracing serial numbers, as was done to determine whether particular items of property had, in fact, been reported stolen, belied the assertion that the incriminating nature of the property was “immediately apparent,” so as to be within “plain view” and subject to seizure.

        While inadvertence is a precondition to a valid seizure of evidence under the plain view exception to the requirement that no search or seizure can be made without a warrant, the kind of plain view to which the inadvertence requirement applies only takes place after there has been an initial search or intrusion.

       </p>
       <p>
        The inadvertence requirement of the plain view doctrine has never been thought to apply where the observation precedes the intrusion. It does not prevent police officers who are lawfully positioned in a public area from intentionally looking for suspects or incriminating evidence freely visible within the confines of a constitutionally protected area.

         Warrantless search of movable vehicle. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Movable vehicle search cases are based on a notion that warrantless seaches must be tolerated because vehicles and evidence contained in them might be removed before it is possible to obtain a search warrant. Thus, the movable vehicle exception may properly be considered to be a subcategory of the exception authorizing a search, with probable cause, to avoid destruction of a known seizable item. Clark v. State, 574 P.2d 1261 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order for a warrantless search of a vehicle to fit within the destructible evidence exception, the prosecution must establish two conditions: (1) There must be probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains evidence or contraband and (2) there must be exigent circumstances justifying conduct of the search without a warrant. Clark v. State, 574 P.2d 1261 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The condition of existence of exigent circumstances is not automatically fulfilled merely because the object searched is an automobile. Clark v. State, 574 P.2d 1261 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The presence of an exigent exception to the warrant requirement must be determined under the factual circumstances of the search rather than the abstract potential for mobility or destruction of the thing searched. Clark v. State, 574 P.2d 1261 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a vehicle was parked in a public place, the search was for contraband, and the officers had grounds for believing that a known accomplice was at large who would be motivated to move the vehicle or take any evidence it contained, exigent circumstances sufficient to justify a warrantless search have been shown.

        Because Anchorage Municipal Code, Anchorage, Alaska, Municipal Code § 09.28.026, authorizes the impoundment of vehicles without regard to whether the vehicle poses any public danger or inconvenience at the time it is seized, the ordinance cannot be justified under a community caretaker rationale. Even if the court tried to limit the scope of the ordinance to situations where impoundment of a vehicle was truly linked to a community caretaker function, the ordinance would still be fatally flawed because it lacks standardized, objectively ascertainable criteria for determining when to impound a vehicle.

        A preincarceration inventory search is an exception to the warrant requirement, where it is conducted to further the governmental purposes of prohibiting the introduction of weapons, illegal drugs, and other contraband or potentially dangerous items into the jail environment and of protecting the arrestee’s property and protecting against claims that loss or damage to that property occurred while the property was under the control of jail authorities, and is limited to the extent necessary to respect Alaska’s constitutional guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures.

        A preincarceration inventory procedure is a “search” in the sense that the term is employed in this section of the Alaska Constitution. Reeves v. State, 599 P.2d 727 (Alaska 1979).

         Justifications for preincarceration inventory search. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        No clear statutory right to release on bail without even temporary incarceration exists in Alaska. Nevertheless, the justifications for a preincarceration inventory do not exist if the arrestee is not to be incarcerated, and no inventory search can be conducted in such cases. Zehrung v. State, 569 P.2d 189 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since defendant was entitled to be released on bail without appearing before a magistrate, there was no justification whatever for processing him through the preincarceration remand and booking procedures and, as an incident to this, searching his person and his personal belongings. Further, the search of defendant’s wallet without a warrant was not justifiable as a search incident to his arrest. Zehrung v. State, 569 P.2d 189 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        A warrantless jailhouse inventory is without justification when an arrestee is not going to be incarcerated, and it is therefore constitutionally impermissible. Zehrung v. State, 569 P.2d 189 (Alaska 1977).

       </p>
       <p>
        A preincarceration inventory search of an arrestee’s person should be no more intensive than reasonably necessary to prevent the entry of weapons, illegal drugs, and other contraband or potentially dangerous items into the jail. Any item taken from the arrestee’s possession in this search may not be further searched or opened except pursuant to a search warrant or another recognized exception to the warrant requirement applicable in the circumstances. Reeves v. State, 599 P.2d 727 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The inventory conducted shall consist of a cataloging of the arrestee’s property thus seized and may not, without a specific request from the arrestee, extend to a search and inventory of the contents of any object, closed or sealed container, luggage, briefcase, or package. Reeves v. State, 599 P.2d 727 (Alaska 1979).

        Prison officials act reasonably when they search all of a convicted prisoner’s personal belongings at the time the prisoner reports to serve his or her sentence, even though some or all of the belongings may be placed in storage. State v. Landon, 936 P.2d 177 (Alaska Ct. App. 1997).

        When a person is arrested on a minor charge for which bail has been set, the person has to be provided a reasonable opportunity to raise bail before being subjected to booking procedures and a pre-incarceration inventory search; although the search violated defendant’s rights, the evidence would have been discovered in any event because he would have been incarcerated and subject to a search after his failure to make bail.

        Where during a preincarceration inventory search of a defendant arrested for a traffic offense, the correctional officer removed an opaque, tightly-wrapped balloon from defendant’s jacket, search of the balloon exceeded the constitutionally permissible scope of a preincarceration inventory search and was not supported by the probable cause required by the plain view exception to the warrant requirement.

       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the inventory is undertaken in whole or in part for the benevolent purpose of protecting the property of the driver of the vehicle does not change the activity into something other than a search. What is determinative is that the conducting of an inventory is a governmental intrusion upon an individual’s privacy. State v. Daniel, 589 P.2d 408 (Alaska 1979).

       </p>
       <p>
        In conjunction with impounding a vehicle, the police, as a matter of routine inventory procedure, are entitled to catalog all articles which are not in closed or sealed containers, luggage, briefcases, and packages. Inventory procedures thus limited constitute only minimal intrusions upon an owner’s reasonable expectation of privacy and are thus constitutionally permissible in light of the rationales underlying police inventory searches of impounded vehicles and Alaska’s constitutional guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures. State v. Daniel, 589 P.2d 408 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        As to any closed, sealed or locked containers, it is sufficient, for routine inventory purposes, that the officer merely list the item as a closed or locked footlocker, briefcase, package, or container and, if deemed necessary, remove the same for safekeeping. State v. Daniel, 589 P.2d 408 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a package of marijuana was found in an automobile on top of a bag containing other packages, it was perfectly proper to take those items to the police station for safekeeping.

        To be effective, a consent to search must be voluntary and must be given by one who has authority to give it. Nix v. State, 621 P.2d 1347 (Alaska 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court's finding that defendant provided verbal assent in response to a state trooper's question was not supported by the record because both the transcript and the audio recording reflected that defendant's verbal response was inaudible, and the trooper did not testify that defendant nodded her head; given the superior court's erroneous findings with regard to defendant's responses, a remand was required. Gosuk v. State, 484 P.3d 130 (Alaska Ct. App. 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Remand was necessary for the superior court to reconsider whether defendant validly consented to the search of her tote; because there was factual overlap between whether the persistent nature of the state trooper's accusatory questioning affected the nature of the stop or the voluntariness of defendant's consent, it was appropriate to allow the superior court in the first instance to reconsider whether the encounter between the trooper and defendant ever ripened into an investigative stop.

        When the accused is directly asked whether he objects to the search, there must be at least some suggestion that his objection is significant or that the search waits upon his consent. When this is combined with a warning of his right to be silent, and his right to counsel, which would seem in the circumstances to put him on notice that he can refuse to cooperate, it is fair to infer that his purported consent is in fact voluntary.

         Right to enter in an emergency. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of police to enter and investigate in an emergency without the accompanying intent to either search or arrest is inherent in the very nature of their duties as police officers, and derives from the common law. The criterion is the reasonableness of the belief of the police as to the existence of an emergency, not the existence of an emergency in fact. Stevens v. State, 443 P.2d 600 (Alaska 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1039, 89 S. Ct. 662, 21 L. Ed. 2d 586 (U.S. 1969).

        Police officers have a right to enter buildings without a warrant in an emergency as an inherent part of their common-law duties. City of Nome v. Ailak, 570 P.2d 162 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where police officers enter buildings without a warrant, it is the reasonableness of the belief of the police as to the existence of an emergency, not the existence of an emergency in fact, which is crucial in evaluating the actions of the police. City of Nome v. Ailak, 570 P.2d 162 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reports of deaths are not always accurate and police officers should be encouraged to check out such reports as quickly as possible in case a spark of life remains. Where police officers had been told there was a body in an individual’s home, the officers had a reasonable belief as to the existence of an emergency which justified their unauthorized entry into the individual’s residence. Therefore, as a matter of law, the entry was privileged. City of Nome v. Ailak, 570 P.2d 162 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The emergency aid doctrine is a well recognized exception to the warrant requirement. Under the doctrine, the warrantless entry of a dwelling is allowed when an officer has reasonable grounds to believe that there is an immediate need to take action to prevent death or to protect persons or property from serious injury. Harrison v. State, 860 P.2d 1280 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Alaska Const. art. I, §§ 14 and 22, affords greater protection against warrantless searches and seizures in the emergency aid context than the United States Constitution and the Alaska Constitution prior to the enactment of § 22. Alaskans’ heightened right to privacy is safeguarded by requiring the State to show (1) the police had reasonable grounds to believe an emergency was at hand and an immediate need for their assistance in the protection of life or property; (2) the search was not primarily motivated by the intent to arrest a person or to seize evidence; and (3) some reasonable basis, approximating probable cause, to associate the emergency with the area or place to be searched. State v. Gibson, 267 P.3d 645 (Alaska 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Investigative stop of a vehicle differs fundamentally from an entry into a home; the reasonable suspicion needed for an investigative stop is a substantially lower showing than the one required for probable cause, and in order to enter a home without a warrant under the emergency aid exception, the officers must satisfy all of the exception's requirements, and each requirement specifically refers to the responding officer's reasonable belief.

       <p>
        Exigent circumstances justified a warrantless entry of an apartment where the defendant who entered the apartment was suspected to be associated with a sizeable illegal drug sale, which had been unexpectedly interrupted by the presence of police; the defendant had tipped off others about the presence of police; the drugs and the money involved in the sale were capable of being readily concealed or destroyed; and the warrantless police intrusion was minimal, consisting of a peaceful entry through an unlocked doorway by officers who had announced their presence and identity.

Even if such action amounted to a warrantless search and seizure, the minimal intrusion was justified under the emergency exception to the warrant requirement and, therefore, was not violative of either the 4th amendment to the Constitution of the United States or this section.

        The boundaries of the area which can be searched incident to a lawful arrest are based upon two rationales: First, to protect the arresting officer and to deprive the prisoner of potential means of escape and, secondly, to avoid destruction of evidence by the arrested person.

       </p>
       <p>
        Unquestionably, when a person is lawfully arrested, the police have the right, without a search warrant, to make a contemporaneous search of the person of the accused for weapons or for the fruits of or implements used to commit the crime. This right to search and seize without a search warrant extends to things under the accused’s immediate control and, to an extent depending on the circumstances of the case, to the place where he is arrested. The rule allowing contemporaneous searches is justified, for example, by the need to seize weapons and other things which might be used to assault an officer or effect an escape, as well as by the need to prevent the destruction of evidence of the crime — things which might easily happen where the weapon or evidence is on the accused’s person or under his immediate control. But these justifications are absent where a search is remote in time or place from the arrest. Merrill v. State, 423 P.2d 686 (Alaska), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1040, 87 S. Ct. 1497, 18 L.

        When a search goes far beyond defendant’s person and the area into which he could reach to obtain a weapon to harm the officer or escape or evidence which he might conceal or destroy, it is unreasonable. McCoy v. State, 491 P.2d 127 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once warrantless searches beyond the area of the arrestee’s immediate control are allowed, the 4th amendment with its “reasonableness” requirement suggests no rational limits to circumscribe the search. Searches of the person, on the other hand, have their own inherent physical limitations. Thus, there is less danger that this exception to the warrant requirement will become unrestrained. McCoy v. State, 491 P.2d 127 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is reasonable for the arresting officer to search the person arrested in order to remove any weapons that the latter might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape. Otherwise, the officer’s safety might well be endangered, and the arrest itself frustrated. In addition, it is entirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for, and seize any evidence on the arrestee’s person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction. And the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary items must, of course, be governed by a like rule. There is ample justification, therefore, for a search of the arrestee’s person and the area within his immediate control. There is no comparable justification, however, for routinely searching any room other than that in which an arrest occurs. McCoy v. State, 491 P.2d 127 (Alaska 1971).

        Upon the lawful, nonpretextual arrest of an individual for a crime, evidence of which could be concealed on the person, a search of the arrestee’s person, his clothing and articles which, akin to clothing, are immediately associated with the person of the arrestee may be searched at the time of the arrest, or within a reasonable period thereafter, and as long as the search is confined within these limits, it is permissible for officers to open and inspect the contents of any closed containers found, unless under the circumstances it could not reasonably be believed that the container would yield a weapon or evidence of the crime for which the arrest was made. Dunn v. State, 653 P.2d 1071 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Closed containers which are not by their nature immediately associated with the person of the arrestee, but which are merely seized from the arrestee’s proximity at the time of his arrest, cannot be opened and inspected without a search warrant after they have been removed from the arrestee’s control and secured by the police. Dunn v. State, 653 P.2d 1071 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        A container on the person of an arrestee at the time of the arrest may be seized, opened, and searched as an incident to the arrest, unless the container is too small to contain a weapon and the arrest is for a crime, such as reckless driving, for which no evidence could exist in the container. This is so even though it is not strictly necessary to open a closed container found on the person of one who is arrested in order to protect the arresting officer from the use of a hidden weapon or to prevent the destruction of evidence. These goals can ordinarily be accomplished simply by seizing the container and removing it from the reach of the arrestee. Hinkel v. Anchorage, 618 P.2d 1069 (Alaska 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1032, 101 S. Ct. 1744, 68 L. Ed. 2d 228 (U.S. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The language “immediately associated with the person of the arrestee” which pointedly excepts certain personal property from the requirement that an exigency must exist to justify a search means that containers found in clothing pockets may be searched, and it also suggests that containers such as purses which are often worn on the person and generally serve the same function as clothing pockets are also excepted from the strict exigency requirement. Hinkel v. Anchorage, 618 P.2d 1069 (Alaska 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1032, 101 S. Ct. 1744, 68 L. Ed. 2d 228 (U.S. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once law enforcement officers have reduced luggage or other personal property not immediately associated with the person of the arrestee to their exclusive control, and there is no longer any danger that the arrestee might gain access to the property to seize a weapon or destroy evidence, a search of that property is no longer an incident of the arrest. Hinkel v. Anchorage, 618 P.2d 1069 (Alaska 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1032, 101 S. Ct. 1744, 68 L. Ed. 2d 228 (U.S. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        A search incident to an arrest, where no evidence of the crime charged could exist on the person, may extend to the person of the arrestee and any containers associated with the arrestee’s person which may contain a gun, a large knife, or a club. A search of smaller containers which could only contain atypical weapons such as a razor blade, a small knife, a safety pin, or a needle must be supported by specific and articulable facts which would lead a reasonable person to believe that such an atypical weapon was in the small container. Jackson v. State, 791 P.2d 1023 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the context of a search incident to arrest, a motion to suppress should have been granted under the Alaska Constitution because it was not shown that an ashtray where the drugs were located was the type of container immediately associated with defendant's person, even though the ashtray was capable of holding personal items. It was not defendant's burden to show that ashtrays in vehicles were not commonly used to store personal items. Pitka v. State, 378 P.3d 398 (Alaska Ct. App. 2016).

       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court properly denied defendant’s motion to suppress a handgun found in the glove box; police were authorized to search the glove box because they were entitled to search defendant’s vehicle incident to his arrest, and the vehicle’s glove box was immediately associated with defendant’s person.

       </p>
       <p>
        Whether an arrest was constitutionally valid depends in turn upon whether, at the moment the arrest was made, the officers had probable cause to make it; whether at that moment the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the petitioner had committed or was committing an offense. Merrill v. State, 423 P.2d 686 (Alaska), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1040, 87 S. Ct. 1497, 18 L. Ed. 2d 607 (U.S. 1967).

         What a lawful arrest does justify
        </b>
        is the search for fruits, instrumentalities, and evidence of the crime for which the arrest is made, and this is so only because the existence of probable cause for the arrest of a person normally justifies probable cause to believe that the suspect possesses such items. McCoy v. State, 491 P.2d 127 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is established that once a person is lawfully arrested, the arresting officers have the right, without a search warrant, to search the arrestee’s person and the area within his immediate control for weapons and destructible evidence of the crime. Avery v. State, 514 P.2d 637 (Alaska 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is probable cause to arrest a suspect, there is likewise probable cause to search his person for fruits, instrumentalities, and evidence of the crime for which the arrest is made. Lemon v. State, 514 P.2d 1151 (Alaska 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent specific articulable facts justifying the intrusion in the privacy in items carried on the person, a warrantless search incident to an arrest, other than for weapons, is unreasonable and therefore violative of the Alaska Constitution if the charge on which the arrest is made is not one evidence of which could be concealed on the person.

         What constitutes arrest. —

       </p>
       <p>
        An arrest does not take place under Alaska law until a person has been taken into custody in order that he may be held to answer for the commission of a crime. Goss v. State, 390 P.2d 220 (Alaska 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 859, 85 S. Ct. 118, 13 L. Ed. 2d 62 (U.S. 1964), overruled, Glasgow v. State, 469 P.2d 682 (Alaska 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither the accused nor his companions were taken into custody until after the pistol and clothing, which gave rise to probable cause to make an arrest, had been seen. When the officer stopped the car he was doing nothing more than conducting an investigation in response to circumstances that aroused his suspicions. Goss v. State, 390 P.2d 220 (Alaska 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 859, 85 S. Ct. 118, 13 L. Ed. 2d 62 (U.S. 1964), overruled, Glasgow v. State, 469 P.2d 682 (Alaska 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Considering the lateness of the hour, the fact that the car was seen coming from the side of the building rather than from the parking lot in front, and that it was being driven without its headlights on, the police officer had the right and the duty to make a prompt investigation, which required him as a matter of practical necessity to stop the car and question the occupants. This activity on the part of the police officer in the circumstances of this case was permissible and did not amount to an arrest. Goss v. State, 390 P.2d 220 (Alaska 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 859, 85 S. Ct. 118, 13 L. Ed. 2d 62 (U.S. 1964), overruled, Glasgow v. State, 469 P.2d 682 (Alaska 1970).

        , the slayer statute, to a son convicted of negligent homicide of his father did not result in a “forfeiture of estate”; substantively, the law was clear that the “forfeiture of estate” clause was not implicated by the slayer rule, which did not prevent the slayer from inheriting in general, only from inheriting from the slayer’s victim. Blodgett v. Blodgett (In re Estate of Blodgett), 147 P.3d 702 (Alaska 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Application of the slayer rule does not actually cause a forfeiture, because the offender did not own the property at the time of the homicide; he merely had an expectancy interest; by killing the decedent, the slayer prevents the property interest from vesting in himself.

        Application of the post-1982 sentencing statute to defendant’s 1985 offense did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses because it did not alter the punishment that defendant faced for his 1981 and 1982 offenses as it only meant that if defendant committed a new crime after 1982, the sentence for that new crime could not run concurrently with the sentences for those earlier cases, and defendant was on notice since 1982 that this consequence would occur if he committed a new crime.

         Registration of sex offenders. —

       <p>
        Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act, 1994 Alaska Sess. Laws 41, is non-punitive and thus its retroactive application does not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws set out in
        U.S. Const. art. I, § 10, cl. 1; the Act is clearly intended as a civil, non-punitive means of identifying previous offenders for the protection of the public, and any adverse effects to registrants do not constitute a significant affirmative disability or restraint to render the Act effectively punitive.
        Smith v. Otte, 538 U.S. 34, 123 S. Ct. 1140, 155 L. Ed. 2d 164 (2003), (reversing
        Doe v. Otte, 248 F.3d 832 (9th Cir. Alaska), amended,

        259 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act, 1994 Alaska Sess. Laws 41, is partially codified in the criminal procedure code is not sufficient to support a conclusion that the legislative intent was punitive for purposes of an ex post facto analysis.
        Smith v. Otte, 538 U.S. 34, 123 S. Ct. 1140, 155 L. Ed. 2d 164 (2003), (reversing

       </p>
       <p>
        Although the duty to register under the sex offender registration statute is clearly retrospective, since the legislature’s intent to promote public welfare is a valid regulatory goal, and since the duties imposed on a sex offender by the statute do not indicate that the legislature had a punitive intent, the duty to register does not violate the prohibition against ex post facto legislation.

      <p>
       Although the courts follow the weight of authority in concluding that there is no constitutional right to a jury following default, the protectiveness historically accorded the jury trial right compels the statement that a party may not forfeit that right inadvertently or without prior notice; therefore, a party who applies for default, while expressly reserving the right to a jury trial on damages, does not automatically forfeit the right. Haines v. Comfort Keepers, Inc., 393 P.3d 422 (Alaska 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was an abuse of discretion to grant a personal representative's application for default while denying the condition on which it was based, retaining his right to a jury trial, because his application for default was expressly conditioned on keeping a jury trial; the superior court was not bound to accept the condition and could have denied it and required the case to proceed to trial, but the representative should not have been deprived of a jury trial when he expressly attempted to preserve it.

      <p>
       Non-economic damages cap does not violate the constitutional right to a trial by jury because the cap does not intrude on the jury’s fact-finding function but rather represents a policy decision that is applied after the jury’s determination. The jury must still make a determination of the amount of damages to be awarded, and the cap is applied only in those cases where the
       jury determines that the damages should be higher than the cap; the law setting a limit on allowable damages does not destroy the jury’s role in awarding damages, but merely limits it. L.D.G., Inc. v. Brown, 211 P.3d 1110 (Alaska 2009).

Intention, the third of the three factors said to comprise the general test for determining whether an object has become a fixture, refers to the intent of the parties that the object being introduced onto the realty become a permanent accession thereto.

       <p>
        It is the general rule that a taking does not occur until: (1) Legal title vests in the state, (2) the state enters into actual possession, or (3) the state takes constructive possession either by causing damage to property or by depriving the owner of full beneficial use of his land. Stewart &amp; Grindle, Inc. v. State, 524 P.2d 1242 (Alaska 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once an owner is deprived of the economic advantages of legal ownership, a taking has occurred. Grant v. State, 560 P.2d 36 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the state is clearly not bound to abide by its construction plans and specifications, it is reasonable for parties negotiating for the sale of the land involved to assume that those plans will be implemented, and where the plans are not implemented, any further economic interference constitutes a second taking for which the state must pay just compensation. Grant v. State, 560 P.2d 36 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The United States supreme court has recognized two classes of per se takings: (1) cases of physical invasion and (2) cases where a regulation denies a landowner of all economically feasible use of the property. When, as here, a case does not fall into either of these categories, courts must engage in a case-specific inquiry to determine whether governmental action effects a taking. The factors which the court should consider are: (1) the character of the governmental action; (2) its economic impact; and (3) its interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations. The legitimacy of the interest advanced by the regulation or land-use decision is also relevant to this inquiry. Anchorage v. Sandberg, 861 P.2d 554 (Alaska 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere granting of a right of first refusal to lease city property containing a private easement is not sufficient proof of the city’s intent to extinguish the easement; thus, there was no taking at the time of the granting of the right. City of Kenai v. Burnett, 860 P.2d 1233 (Alaska 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Applying a setback requirement to a resident’s property was not a taking without just compensation because the setback requirement was in effect when the resident took possession of the property, so the resident had no lawful property interest in expanding structures on the property in a manner that violated the requirement.

        For the time of valuation to be advanced in the case of an impending condemnation depriving a property owner of the economic advantages of ownership, (1) marketability must be substantially impaired, (2) the condemning authority must have evidenced an unequivocal intention to take the specific parcel of land, (3) the special use of the land by the owner must be acquiring and holding the property for subsequent development and sale, and (4) the owner must have taken active steps to accomplish this purpose.

        There was no basis for finding a per se taking under Alaska Const. art. I, § 18 because the municipality did not physically invade the homebuilding company’s land and it did not completely deprive the company of all economic value of its land; indeed, the company had constructed houses on many of the lots and sold them to third parties and, moreover, the company made no effort to show that the value of its land was at all altered by the municipality’s actions.

        Dismissal of landowners’ takings claim under Alaska Const. art.

        Where owners received compensation for the taking of their property for construction of a highway, a second taking occurred, separate from the first, when the state decided to redesign the highway; the second taking consisted of a loss of access due to closure of an intersection and due to the limitation of travel on the frontage road to one-way traffic if the settlement or the receipt of the intersection award had been in reliance upon unrestricted access via an intersection which was to be closed with the redesign of the highway. Alsop v. State, 586 P.2d 1236 (Alaska 1978).

        Where owners contended that a second taking of their property occurred when the state redesigned the highway for the construction of which their property had been originally taken, closing off an intersection and limiting travel on the frontage road to one-way traffic, in order to recover damages, each of the owners must demonstrate that he or a predecessor in interest had a portion of his property taken for the original construction project, that he or his predecessor relied on construction of the intersection or the two-way frontage road, or both, in settling or receiving an award for their condemnation claims, and that his remaining property had decreased in value as a result of the highway modifications.

In the first case, the servient estate is burdened, which results in a diminution in the estate’s fair market value. In the second case, the dominant estate loses its benefit, which also results in a diminution in the estate’s fair market value. City of Kenai v. Burnett, 860 P.2d 1233 (Alaska 1993).

        It must be shown that the use for which the property is claimed to be adaptable is reasonably probable.

Thus, many courts, including Alaska’s, have allowed evidence of a reasonably probable subdivision to be admitted to prove the adaptability of the land for subdivision use. Dash v.

        Where there is testimony that the highest and best use of the property is as an industrial subdivision, and evidence that other property in the immediate area was subdivided for industrial purposes, the proposed subdivision is not purely conjectual or speculative.

        If the land were adaptable for subdivision purposes, it would seem that the potential income to be derived from sales of the subdivided lots would be highly relevant to a determination of the “market value,” especially to the extent that sophisticated investors who make decisions on the basis of income capitalization take part in market transactions.

        in contexts other than proposed subdivisions, has been recognized as an accepted method of valuation by a number of jurisdictions. Although capitalization of anticipated proceeds from a proposed subdivision necessarily has a speculative element, it still has a direct impact on the property’s market value since it will influence investment decisions and thereby affect supply and demand. Dash v. State, 491 P.2d 1069 (Alaska 1971).

        To the extent that the “just compensation” guarantee in this section comprises a notion of fair market value rather than merely the price the property will bring in an imperfect market, income capitalization must be considered particularly apposite.

       </p>
       <p>
        Even in a market where a parcel’s price is unaffected by its income potential, income capitalization must be considered to have a bearing on “market value.” The danger that market price will not closely reflect market value is enhanced when the property is not currently generating income.

       <p>
        In Alaska, inclusion of value enhancement attributable to the project for which the property is being taken is generally prohibited in determining condemnation awards. This general rule is in accordance with the requirement in the Alaska and United States Constitutions that just compensation be paid for private property taken for public use, since it only prevents a landowner from receiving more value for his property than he would if the government had no use for his land and it was purchased by a private buyer. However, this rule does not preclude an owner from receiving compensation for value added to the property by an unrelated public project which took no portion of the tract involved. State v. Alaska Continental Dev. Corp., 630 P.2d 977 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        An exception to the general prohibition against awarding enhanced value from the project for which a parcel is taken occurs when the parcel was not properly within the scope of the original project but was included in a subsequent enlargement of the project. In those circumstances, a landowner should not be deprived of the value added in the meantime by the proximity of the improvement. State v. Alaska Continental Dev. Corp., 630 P.2d 977 (Alaska 1980).

        The majority rule excludes property tax assessments from evidence in condemnation cases on the rationale that such an assessment is res inter alios acta, notoriously unreliable as a criterion of true value or the opinion of persons not called as witnesses and subject to cross-examination.

       <p>
        It is almost everywhere the law that the value placed upon a parcel of land for the purposes of taxation by the assessors of the town in which it is situated is no evidence of its value for other than tax purposes. State v. 45,621 Square Feet of Land, 475 P.2d 553 (Alaska 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        AS 29.53.080 does not furnish the basis for the admissibility of tax assessments as evidence in condemnation proceedings.

       </p>
       <p>
        In view of the special purposes for which tax assessments are made, the fact that there is little likelihood that an owner would contest an under-assessment or an assessment which did not reflect the property’s full value, the potential unreliability of such assessments due to the varied qualifications of assessors, and the fact that such assessments standing alone embody the opinions of persons not called as witnesses and not subject to cross-examination, the admission of property tax assessments as evidence of fair market value in condemnation actions is prohibited.

       </p>
       <p>
        The taking of an easement does constitute an appropriation of the owner’s property regardless of its minuscule effect. But where the property owner failed to object to instructions expressly permitting the entry of an award of no compensation and the difference between an award of $0.00 compensation and a nominal sum to which the property owner would have been entitled is de minimus, the failure to award compensation per se did not require reversal.

        State was entitled to a new trial on the amount of just compensation required for the taking of an abutting landowner’s right of access to a controlled access highway, where the jury’s answers to special interrogatories were internally inconsistent and inconsistent with the general verdict and the jury’s conclusion that the remaining property was worth more after the taking than the entire parcel was worth before the taking was irreconcilable with its conclusion that the remainder received no special benefit from the highway project.

       , prohibiting a felon from possessing a concealable firearm, does not violate this provision of the constitution by failing to differentiate between violent and non-violent felons. The legislature has the authority to regulate the possession of guns by felons, and that authority is not limited by art. I, § 19. Wilson v. State, 207 P.3d 565 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).

       <p>
        <b>
         The effect of this section
        </b>
        is to place privacy among the specifically enumerated rights in Alaska’s constitution. Ravin v. State, 537 P.2d 494 (Alaska 1975); Woods &amp; Rohde, Inc. v. State, Dep't of Labor, 565 P.2d 138 (Alaska 1977).

         Scope to be afforded right to privacy. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that privacy is among the specifically enumerated rights in the Alaska Constitution does not, in and of itself, yield answers concerning what scope should be accorded to this right of privacy. Ravin v. State, 537 P.2d 494 (Alaska 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The contours of Alaska’s right to privacy are not yet firmly established.
        </b>
        The meaning of privacy of necessity must vary depending on the factual context and the often competing interests of society and the individual. State v. Glass, 583 P.2d 872 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The test for what interests are protected
        </b>
        under Alaska’s constitutional right to privacy are, first, a person has exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as “reasonable.” Hilbers v. Municipality of Anchorage, 611 P.2d 31 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Alaska’s constitution, unlike the federal constitution, contains an explicit guarantee of privacy.
        </b>
        Woods &amp; Rohde, Inc. v. State, Dep't of Labor, 565 P.2d 138 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the federal right of privacy derives from a broad reading of the due process clause of the 14th amendment or from “emanations” from other constitutional provisions, the right to privacy in Alaska is guaranteed by an explicit constitutional provision, i.e., this section. Falcon v. Alaska Pub. Offices Comm'n, 570 P.2d 469 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Thus, state right is broader than federal right. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        It is clear from both this section and Alaska decisional law that the right of privacy guaranteed to Alaskan citizens is broader in scope than that guaranteed in the federal constitution. Woods &amp; Rohde, Inc. v. State, Dep't of Labor, 565 P.2d 138 (Alaska 1977); State v. Daniel, 589 P.2d 408 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The express right to privacy in the Alaska Constitution is broader than that afforded by the United States Constitution. Messerli v. State, 626 P.2d 81 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although there is no recorded legislative history of Alaska’s right to privacy provision, it is clear that it affords broader protection than the penumbral right inferred from other constitutional provisions. Were that not the case, there would have been no need to amend the constitution. State v. Glass, 583 P.2d 872 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>

        <b>
         Federal and state right to privacy compared. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the language of the federal cases on the right to privacy, it must be found that the privacy invasion is necessary to a compelling state interest, that the governmental regulation does not sweep too broadly. Under the Alaska Constitution, the required level of justification turns on the precise nature of the privacy interest involved. Falcon v. Alaska Pub. Offices Comm'n, 570 P.2d 469 (Alaska 1977).

         Federal decisions not determinative. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Federal decisions dealing with the 4th amendment to the United States Constitution should not be regarded as determinative of the scope of Alaska’s right to privacy amendment, since no such express right is contained in the United States Constitution. State v. Glass, 583 P.2d 872 (Alaska 1978).

        <i>
         Katz v. United States
        </i>
        , 389 U.S. 347, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967), first, that a person have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy; and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable, has been adopted for Alaska.

         And may be held subordinate to express constitutional powers. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a compelling state interest is shown, the right may be held to be subordinate to express constitutional powers such as the authorization of the legislature to promote and protect public health and provide for the general welfare. Gray v. State, 525 P.2d 524 (Alaska 1974); Ravin v. State, 537 P.2d 494 (Alaska 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a matter affects the public, directly or indirectly, it loses its wholly private character, and can be made to yield when an appropriate public need is demonstrated. Ravin v. State, 537 P.2d 494 (Alaska 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The right of privacy is not absolute.
        </b>
        Gray v. State, 525 P.2d 524 (Alaska 1974); Ravin v. State, 537 P.2d 494 (Alaska 1975); State v. Erickson, 574 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        No one has an absolute right to do things in the privacy of his own home which will affect himself or others adversely. Ravin v. State, 537 P.2d 494 (Alaska 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither the state nor the federal right to privacy is absolute, but it is part of the judicial function to ensure that governmental infringements of this right are supported by sufficient justification. Falcon v. Alaska Pub. Offices Comm'n, 570 P.2d 469 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        In expressing the rights to free speech and privacy, the framers of the state constitution appear to have recognized a right of universal freedom and a right to be left alone which is rooted in the natural inclination of human beings. But these rights, in a free society such as this, have never been recognized as absolute and without limitations. Messerli v. State, 626 P.2d 81 (Alaska 1980).

       <p>
        Jones v. Jennings, 788 P.2d 732 (Alaska 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to privacy does not entitle a person to engage in conduct in his home which affects others adversely. People do not have a right to argue so loudly in their home that they disturb the sleep of their neighbors. Earley v. State, 789 P.2d 374 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Alaska Const. art. I, §§ 14 and 22, affords greater protection against warrantless searches and seizures in the emergency aid context than the United States Constitution and the Alaska Constitution prior to the enactment of § 22. Alaskans’ heightened right to privacy is safeguarded by requiring the State to show (1) the police had reasonable grounds to believe an emergency was at hand and an immediate need for their assistance in the protection of life or property; (2) the search was not primarily motivated by the intent to arrest a person or to seize evidence; and (3) some reasonable basis, approximating probable cause, to associate the emergency with the area or place to be searched. State v. Gibson, 267 P.3d 645 (Alaska 2012).

         But government must establish legitimate and compelling interest. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        While it is true that the right to privacy, similar to the right to liberty and the right freely to speak, write and publish on all subjects, is not absolute, such rights may not be abridged by governmental action unless the government meets its substantial burden of establishing that an abridgment of any such right is justified by a legitimate and compelling governmental interest. Messerli v. State, 626 P.2d 81 (Alaska 1980).

        No adequate justification for the state’s intrusion into the citizen’s right to privacy by its prohibition of possession of marijuana by an adult for personal consumption in the home has been shown. Ravin v. State, 537 P.2d 494 (Alaska 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Citizens of the State of Alaska have a basic right to privacy in their homes under Alaska’s constitution. This right to privacy would encompass the possession and ingestion of substances such as marijuana in a purely personal, noncommercial context in the home unless the state can meet its substantial burden and show that proscription of possession of marijuana in the home is supportable by achievement of a legitimate state interest. Ravin v. State, 537 P.2d 494 (Alaska 1975).

         Medical marijuana law constitutional. —

       </p>
       <p>
        Alaska’s medical marijuana law does not require medical marijuana users to divulge any details about the debilitating conditions they suffer, and although it does require them to register and to identify their approving physicians, the law explicitly requires the department to keep the registry confidential; therefore, the law’s confidential registration process does not violate the constitutional right to privacy.

        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Since eight ounces or more of marijuana is an amount large enough to justify legislative regulation even when it is possessed in a residence for purely personal use, AS 11.71.050(a)(3)(E) does not offend the right of privacy guaranteed by the state Constitution. Walker v. State, 991 P.2d 799 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Privacy provision of Alaska Const. art. I, § 22 protected the right of an adult to possess a small amount of marijuana in his home for personal use; the legislature had the power to set reasonable limits on the amount of marijuana that people could possess for personal use in their homes. Thus, the criminalization of the possession of 25 or more marijuana plants, regardless of the weight of the marijuana in its processed form, did not conflict with the state case law; because defendant had 43 live marijuana plants in his home, his misconduct involving a controlled substance in the fourth degree, a class C felony, conviction under AS 11.71.040(a)(3)(G) was affirmed.

       </p>
       <p>
        The need for control of drivers under the influence of marijuana and the existing doubts as to the safety of marijuana demonstrate a sufficient justification for the prohibition found in AS 17.12.010 as an exercise of the state’s police power for the public welfare.

       <p>
        Like interference with rights of privacy within the home, interference with certain relationships such as the doctor-patient relationship ordinarily mandates a very high level of justification. There must be a “fair and substantial relation” between the statutory means and a legitimate governmental purpose. Falcon v. Alaska Pub. Offices Comm'n, 570 P.2d 469 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The decisions of both the supreme court of this state and the United States supreme court clearly establish that certain types of information communicated in the context of the physician-patient relationship fall within a constitutionally-protected zone of privacy. Falcon v. Alaska Pub. Offices Comm'n, 570 P.2d 469 (Alaska 1977).

       </p>
       <p>
        Until appropriate regulations are promulgated to protect certain classes of patients, the conflict of interest law may not be applied so as to require reporting the names of individual patients of a physician. Falcon v. Alaska Pub. Offices Comm'n, 570 P.2d 469 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The extent to which the governmental interest in promoting fair and honest government would be impeded by not strictly complying with the conflict of interest law, does not outweigh the individual’s privacy interest in protecting sensitive personal information from public disclosure. Falcon v. Alaska Pub. Offices Comm'n, 570 P.2d 469 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular situations disclosure under the mandates of the conflict of interest law of the mere fact that an individual has visited a certain physician may have the effect of making public certain confidential or sensitive information, i.e., a specialized practice might reveal a certain type of treatment a patient has received. Falcon v. Alaska Pub. Offices Comm'n, 570 P.2d 469 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        To determine the validity of the disclosure provisions of the conflict of interest law, both the nature and the extent of the privacy invasion and the strength of the state interest requiring disclosure must be considered. Falcon v. Alaska Pub. Offices Comm'n, 570 P.2d 469 (Alaska 1977).

        When one is in a public restroom, a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy which society is prepared to recognize.

        Factors to consider for bail pending sentence appeal. —

      <p>
       While a superior court was to ensure that the rights of a victim were honored and that the victim's concerns were appropriately considered, particularly those concerns related to the victim's safety, the victim's desire for finality was an insufficient reason to deny defendant bail release. Likewise, community condemnation, although an appropriate consideration in crafting a sentence, was an inappropriate consideration in the context of a request for bail release pending resolution of an excessive sentence claim. Shepersky v. State, 401 P.3d 990 (Alaska Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court in deciding whether to grant bail pending a sentence appeal was to consider (1) whether defendant established by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed bail conditions would reasonably assure defendant's appearance and reasonably assure the safety of the victim and the community; and (2) the extent (if any) that defendant's legal rights were to be prejudiced if defendant was denied bail pending appeal but ultimately prevailed on defendant's underlying claim that the sentence was excessive. Shepersky v. State, 401 P.3d 990 (Alaska Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court was not entitled to clarification of the appellate court’s order to set defendant’s bail because it was up to the superior court to inquire into the assets available to defendant’s family to meet the monetary component of her bail, the appropriate legal framework for the analysis was set out in the Alaska Constitution, the superior court should also consider its obligations under the bail statute, the statutory restrictions were predicated on the assumption that there had already been a full inquiry into the available assets, and specific findings were needed the trial court’s justification for imposing the $ 500,000 cash or corporate surety monetary condition.

       Alaska’s ban on same-sex marriage and refusal to recognize same-sex marriages lawfully entered in other states as set forth in Alaska Const. art. 1, § 25 and AS §§ 25.05.011, 25.05.013, was unconstitutional as a deprivation of basic due process and equal protection principles under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution because no state interest provided exceedingly persuasive justification for the significant infringement of rights that they inflicted upon homosexual individuals.

      </p>
      <p>
       Benefits programs were held to facially discriminate against same-sex domestic partners by covering married public employees but not domestic partners because, unlike opposite-sex domestic partners, same-sex domestic partners were barred from marriage under this section and thus were absolutely precluded from eligibility; the policy was not substantially related to government interests and thus violated equal protection under Alaska Const. art. I, § 1. Alaska Civ. Liberties Union v. State, 122 P.3d 781 (Alaska 2005).

       This section does not preclude challenges by same-sex couples to government policies that discriminate between married and unmarried couples; therefore, same-sex couples were able to challenge benefits programs that covered married couples but not domestic partners.

       The supreme court is admittedly under a duty to reconcile, whenever possible, challenged legislation with the constitution by rendering a construction that would harmonize the statutory language with specific constitutional provisions. However, in fulfilling that duty, the extent to which the express language of the provision can be altered and departed from and the extent to which the infirmities can be rectified by the use of implied terms is limited by the constitutionally decreed separation of powers which prohibits the supreme court from enacting legislation or redrafting defective statutes.

      Because prohibitions like this are contrary to general public policy which favors eligibility for office, they are usually given a literal construction and are rarely expanded beyond their literal terms. June 29, 1976 Op. Att’y Gen.

     </p>
     <p>
      Reading the prohibition purely literally it does not apply to a legislator’s running for a seat in the other house of the legislature. His office, that of a “legislator,” remains the same. While the term of office differs (four years for members of the senate, two years for members of the house) and the constituency may differ, the “office” of “legislator” is constant. June 29, 1976 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      While the supreme court has limited the exceptions to the operation of this section to those expressly made by the Alaska Constitution, no exception is required for a legislator’s running for legislative office, because the prohibition has no application and should not be expanded to apply to that situattion. June 29, 1976 Op. Att’y Gen.

       Termination of a legislative researcher for the legislative affairs agency for expressing her economic and political views in an interview in violation of a “public neutrality requirement,” an unwritten and informal understanding, for which she declined a reprimand, and for refusing to abide by the director’s interpretation of the public neutrality requirement in the future was an administrative rather than a legislative act and was not within the scope of legislative immunity.

      The legislature shall convene in regular session each year on the fourth Monday in January, but the month and day may be changed by law. The legislature shall adjourn from regular session no later than one hundred twenty consecutive calendar days from the date it convenes except that a regular session may be extended once for up to ten consecutive calendar days. An extension of the regular session requires the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the membership of each house of the legislature.

      The people, in exercising their power under the Alaska Const., art. XI, § 2, are in a sense acting as a larger legislative body of the state, and this section does not restrict its effect to operation upon legislative bills alone. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 36.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unless constitutional provisions relating to the form of bills are expressly made inapplicable to acts proposed and enacted by the initiative, such restrictions as to form will apply to acts proposed by the initiative. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 36.
     </p>
     <p>
      The requirement that the secretary of state [now lieutenant governor] certify the form of an application under the Alaska Const., art. XI, § 2, would be meaningless if the general provisions of this section did not apply; there would be nothing to certify to since the article on initiative sets out no particular form of an initiative. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 36.
     </p>
     <p>
      Alaska Const., art. XI, § 2, states that an application should contain the “bill” to be initiated; and this section of the constitution deals with the form of “every bill.” It is not to be presumed that the delegates to the constitutional convention intended to use varying definitions of the same words. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 36.

        The one-subject provision should not be construed so as to unnecessarily restrict the scope and operation of laws, or to multiply their number excessively, or to prevent the legislature from embracing in one act all matters properly connected with one general subject.

        Extending the scope of Alaska Const., art.

         Requirements for satisfying one-subject rule. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        To satisfy the Confinement Clause, an appropriations bill (1) must contain qualifying language of a minimum necessary to explain the Legislature’s intent regarding how the money appropriated is to be spent; (2) must not administer the program of expenditures; (3) must not enact law or amend existing law; (4) must not extend beyond the life of the appropriation; and (5) must contain language that is germane, or appropriate, to an appropriations bill.

        The one-subject rule is not restricted to those legislative acts which also must be approved by the voters; rather, it applies equally to all enactments of the legislature. Short v. State, 600 P.2d 20 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        An argument that measures submitted to the voters are deserving of enhanced protection under the one-subject rule of this section has little merit. Except to the extent that a bond proposition authorizing complicated and diverse projects is so confusing that it fails to provide the notice to the voters of the subject matter involved which the due process clause requires, the policies behind the one-subject rule are the same as regards the member of the state legislature who must vote on the measure in the first instance and the voters who must subsequently ratify the enactment.

        In determining whether a bill is confined to one subject, all that is necessary is that the act should embrace some one general subject; and by this is meant, merely, that all matters treated of should fall under some one general idea, be so connected with or related to each other logically or in popular understanding, as to be parts of, or germane to, one general subject.

       <p>
        The test set out in Gellert v. State, 522 P.2d 1120 (Alaska 1974), requires no more than that the various provisions of single legislative enactment fairly relate to the same subject, or have a natural connection therewith. Short v. State, 600 P.2d 20 (Alaska 1979).

       The requirement that the vote on final passage be by individual yeas and nays, and be recorded in the relevant house journal, is a formality embodying several purposes: to ensure deliberation prior to passage, to ensure that the requisite majority of each house affirmatively votes to enact a bill into law, and to provide a public record of the vote cast by each legislator.

       The requirements that the vote of each legislator on final passage of a bill be recorded and that no bill may pass without an affirmative vote of a majority of the membership of each house are meant to ensure deliberation prior to passage, to ensure that the requisite majority of each house affirmatively votes to enact a bill into law, and to provide a public record of the vote cast by each legislator.

        Meaning of “final passage” requirement. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       “Final passage” is not a legislative term of art, referring only to the initial passage of a bill in its house of origin, and to the initial passage of the bill, in amended or original form, by the second house. Plumley v. George E. Hale, M.D., Inc., 594 P.2d 497 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>

       “Final passage” refers to that vote which is the final one in a particular house with regard to a particular bill. Such a final vote may occur at various stages. It may be on the third reading of a bill; it may be the vote to concur in the amendments adopted by the second house; it may be the vote to recede from amendments not concurred in by the other house; or it may be the vote to adopt the amendments proposed by a conference committee.

      The purpose of the veto is to prevent the adoption of undesirable legislation; the veto power is not a power to change the effect of proposed laws or to do anything concerning them except to approve or disapprove them as a whole. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 18.
     </p>
     <p>
      The veto power may be exercised only against entire bills; and it may not be exercised upon sections of bills except in the case of appropriation bills. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 18.

     <p>
      The referendum is a veto power that is analogous to the veto power vested in the governor by this section. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 18.

     <p>
      The referendum and the veto power serve similar functions in the legislative process; hence, the limitations of one apply to the other, except as distinctions are specified in the constitution. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 18.

      <p>
       Non-monetary asset transfers are not appropriations subject to the governor’s enhanced veto under Alaska Const., art. II. Therefore, a 2000 bill (ch. 136, SLA 2000) allowing the University of Alaska to select between 250,000 and 260,000 acres of state lands which would then be conveyed to the university to manage was not an appropriation, and an override of the governor’s veto required only a two-thirds majority in the legislature, not the three-fourths majority required for the overriding of a veto of an appropriations bill. Having received the required two-thirds majority, the veto was successfully overridden and the bill became law. State Legislative Council v. Knowles, 86 P.3d 891 (Alaska 2004).

      <p>
       The required local contribution was constitutional because the existing funding formula did not violate the dedicated funds clause, the appropriations clause, or the governor’s veto where the minutes of the constitutional convention and the historical context of those proceedings revealed that the delegates did not intend for required local contributions to be a state tax or license; the local contribution never entered the state treasury.

        Purpose of item veto power. —

       The item veto power is intended only to limit the legislature’s appropriation power, not to grant the executive a quasi-legislative appropriation power permitting appropriations the legislature never enacted. Alaska Legislative Council v. Knowles, 21 P.3d 367 (Alaska 2001).

      <p>
       The word “item” in the item veto power is defined as “a sum of money dedicated to a particular purpose,” and this power does not permit the governor to strike from an appropriation bill descriptive language that does not specify the amount appropriated.

All beds will meet department standards for Community Residential Centers. Contracts will be competitively bid,” the governor could not veto these three sentences because they were not an “item” subject to his constitutionally-granted item veto power.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the legislature enacted three appropriations for the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute (ASMI) and each contained identical language which made the appropriation “contingent on ASMI having no employees who are located outside Alaska whose positions are classified at more than Range 21 on the state salary schedule under AS

      </p>
      <p>
       The governor’s veto of language which referred to the efficiency of a program that appropriated funds to the Department of Corrections for a therapeutic treatment community program in Valdez was invalid, because the vetoed language was not an “item” subject to the governor’s veto power where it did not appropriate any sum of money to a particular purpose.

       Any time the legislature allocates moneys from the general fund or special funds, the governor’s line item veto would be appropriate. However, the sale of general obligation bonds is the commitment of the state to a debtor relationship with those who purchase the bonds, and is therefore distinguishable from such allocations.

        Differentiating certain appropriations from debt financing. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are valid reasons for differentiating between debt financing and other appropriations from public revenues. First, the check on the power of the legislature that lies in the people means there is less need for the executive to have a “strong control on the purse strings.” Second, the purposes are quite often different. Third, the executive still has the power to veto any bill in its entirety. Thomas v. Rosen, 569 P.2d 793 (Alaska 1977).

        Less need for line item veto power where there is requirement of voter approval. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The contracting of state debt is governed by the Alaska Constitution which provides in art. IX, § 8 and except for specifically defined situations, the debt may not be contracted without the approval of the electorate. This requirement operates as a check on legislative power just as the item veto power of the governor checks legislative appropriations. However, each functions in its own realm. Where there is a requirement of voter approval, there is less need for the executive check on legislative power. Thomas v. Rosen, 569 P.2d 793 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       In special obligation bonding, the general taxing power of the state is not pledged. The bonds are paid by revenues generated by the project. In such a case, the “purse” of the state would be only slightly affected — only by the moneys required to float the bond, which is usually paid back out of the special fund. In such circumstances, where there is a check on the legislature’s discretion coming directly from the people and repayment coming directly from the project, there is little need for the extraordinary executive power of the line item veto. Thomas v. Rosen, 569 P.2d 793 (Alaska 1977).

      <p>
       Examining both the legislative goals and the means used to advance them, the supreme court must determine whether the legislation bears a “fair and substantial relationship” to legitimate purposes. If this standard is satisfied, the bill will not be invalid because of incidental local or private advantages. State v. Lewis, 559 P.2d 630 (Alaska), cert. denied, 432 U.S. 901, 97 S. Ct. 2943, 53 L.

       A waiver of immunity from suit in a court of the state does not constitute a waiver of immunity of a suit brought by the state in a federal court. Alaska v. O/S Lynn Kendall, 310 F. Supp. 433 (D. Alaska 1970).

      <p>
       The Alaska constitution waives absolute sovereign immunity but retains a restricted version of immunity under Alaska Const. art. II, § 21, and the supreme court has consistently stated that prejudgment interest may not be assessed against the state unless specifically authorized by legislation; applicability of sovereign immunity presents a question of law that the supreme court reviews de novo. State v. Alaska State Emples. Ass'n, 190 P.3d 720 (Alaska 2008).

       In dismissing a company’s fraudulent conveyance and conspiracy claims against the state, the trial court erred in concluding that the state could not waive its sovereign immunity defense through its litigation conduct and in failing to apply the correct test for determining waiver of the state’s sovereign immunity.

       Although the Alaska Constitution does not expressly address itself to the doctrine of separation of powers, the state constitution is divided into a number of separate articles, and since this article concerns the executive branch, it can fairly be implied that this state does recognize the separation of powers doctrine. Public Defender Agency v. Superior Court, Third Judicial Dist., 534 P.2d 947 (Alaska 1975); Rust v. State, 582 P.2d 134 (Alaska 1978).

       Former AS 37.07.080(g)(2) was unconstitutional for two reasons: first, because it delegated power over appropriations, a power which can only be exercised by the legislature in accord with the procedures mandated by Alaska Const., art. II; second, because the statute lacked standards to guide the exercise of administrative discretion. In either case, the statute violated the principle of separation of powers. State v. Fairbanks N.

       Although this section authorizes the governor to sue in the name of the state, it confers no express power to sue in any narrower capacity. Legislative Council v. Knowles, 988 P.2d 604 (Alaska 1999).

       Where neither the original nor the amended complaint gave any indication that the governor named the legislative council as a defendant in its limited capacity as a service agency, and where the complaints asserted no particular service-related acts or functions as a basis for proceeding against the council or its individual legislator-members, the action came within the originally intended scope of the prohibition of this section. Legislative Council v. Knowles, 988 P.2d 604 (Alaska 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       By directing against the legislature’s interim alter ego an action questioning the propriety of a purely legislative act, the governor effectively sought to hold the legislature itself “answerable” to him for its interpretations and handling of matters of law, and the substance of that suit infringed upon the legislature’s constitutional domain in precisely the manner that the drafters intended to prohibit.

       Because of the importance and unique nature of the protection embodied in this section, the question of whether the section forbade the filing of suit by the governor against the legislative council merited an exception to the mootness doctrine.

       Where a suit tests the basic constitutional structure of the state’s tripartite system of government, it necessarily involves a matter of general public importance that transcends the executive branch’s parochial interests and implicates interests common to all state citizens.

        Appointment of executive officers is an executive function;

      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the responsibilities imposed by this section and the authority granted by § 1 of this article, the governor is necessarily clothed with the power to appoint subordinate executive officers to aid him in carrying out the laws of Alaska. Bradner v. Hammond, 553 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1976).

       With respect to regulations that conferred medical benefits and retirement system benefits on same-sex partners of state employees, an organization had the right to have a judgment ordering the state to confer such benefits enforced, and the executive branch had the constitutional authority, pursuant to this section, to enforce the judgment. An amicus request by the legislature seeking a stay that the organization opposed and that the state had not formally sought or claimed to be needed would be a denial of due process and an encroachment on the executive branch’s constitutional powers of enforcement.

       While the governor and the attorney general are generally charged with protecting the public interest, their position in a controversy involving legislation authorizing a three-way exchange of land between the State of Alaska, the United States government, and a regional corporation of Alaska natives was clearly adverse to that represented by plaintiff taxpayers, and the taxpayers were held to have standing to sue.

       Since in other statutes the legislature has seen fit to exercise its authority under this section over the Department of Health and Social Services expressly, an implied exercise of that power will not easily be found in language that is directed only to the judiciary and uses no term even vaguely indicating an intent to make the department’s resources available to the courts. Thus, the vague directive of AS

      <p>
       There is no provision in the Alaska Constitution similar to the provision of article III, § 1, of the United States Constitution that “Judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior.” Therefore, the argument by analogy with the federal provision that terms of judges of “constitutional courts” cannot be shortened by Congress is inapposite to establish that terms of Alaska district judges cannot be shortened by the legislature.

       In civil cases an order of the superior court issued in its appellate capacity which remands for further proceedings is not a final judgment for purposes of former App. R. 5, concerning judgments from which an appeal may be taken. However, a party to such a remand may properly invoke supreme court discretionary review jurisdiction where the requirements of former App. R. 23 and 24 (a), providing for review of nonappealable orders or decisions and limiting the granting of petition for review, respectively, are met.

      </p>
      <p>
       The exercise of discretionary review in civil cases will insure that the supreme court has the opportunity to exercise final review of questions decided by the superior court in remanding a case whenever it is necessary to provide immediate guidance on a particular matter. To preserve this constitutionally imposed review function, a party need not have a further absolute right to review prior to final disposition of the litigation after remand by the superior court. Following final judgment in the trial courts, a party always may appeal to the supreme court as a matter of right. City &amp; Borough of Juneau v. Thibodeau, 595 P.2d 626 (Alaska 1979).

       The directive of this section that the legislature provide for the selection, terms, and qualifications of the judges of the courts it creates is unqualified and would appear to vest absolute discretion in the legislature. Buckalew v. Holloway, 604 P.2d 240 (Alaska 1979).

       It is impossible to extract from this article a firm concept of judicial independence applicable to legislatively created courts. Buckalew v. Holloway, 604 P.2d 240 (Alaska 1979).

        Magistrate is “judge”. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A magistrate is not merely “an assistant” to a district court judge, but presides with full authority over a court of limited jurisdiction, exercising the judicial power vested by Alaska Const., art. IV, § 1. Such a person is a “judge” within the meaning of this section. Buckalew v. Holloway, 604 P.2d 240 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Term”. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       As it is used in this section, the word “term” was not intended to refer to a period of service that is fixed in time. A broader definition of the word, “the time for which something lasts,” is in closer accord with the apparent purposes of this section. Buckalew v. Holloway, 604 P.2d 240 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       With the exception of art. IV, wherever “term” or “service at the pleasure of” appears in the constitutional text originally adopted, the references are to a period of service for a particular office, thus allowing the drafters to be precise in their terminology. The language of this section and § 13 of this article, on the other hand, applies to any judge of any court the legislature might create, and “term” in that context may intend only the more general, though equally valid connotation of, any limitation on a period of service. Buckalew v. Holloway, 604 P.2d 240 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Provision that magistrates serve at the pleasure of the presiding judge
       </b>
       of the superior court in the judicial district for which appointed does not conflict with the requirement of this section that judges be “selected . . . for terms prescribed by law,” since with respect to the accountability demanded in this requirement, service “at the pleasure of ” constitutes a “term.” Buckalew v. Holloway, 604 P.2d 240 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if Alaska Const., art. IV, § 10, which created a commission on judicial qualifications which could recommend to the supreme court that a justice or judge be suspended, removed from office, retired, or censured, is applicable to magistrates, it does not restrict the legislature’s authority under this section to prescribe that magistrates shall serve at the pleasure of the presiding judge, since at the very least, the removal provisions of this article are supplementary to the removal procedure that defines the end of a judge’s term. Buckalew v. Holloway, 604 P.2d 240 (Alaska 1979).

       The Alaska Commission on Judicial Qualifications (now Commission on Judicial Conduct) was created by a constitutional amendment which became effective in 1968. This amendment is based on a 1966 revision of the judicial article of the California Constitution. In re Hanson, 532 P.2d 303 (Alaska 1975).

       Concerning the subject of sanctions this section and AS 22.30.070(c)(2) provide that upon recommendation of the Commission on Judicial Conduct the supreme court of Alaska may suspend, remove, retire or censure a judge. In re Robson, 500 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1972).

      </p>
      <p>
       Normally considerable weight will be accorded to a given recommendation from the Commission on Judicial Qualifications (now Commission on Judicial Conduct), if supported by an adequate factual basis. Nevertheless, both this section and AS 22.30.070(c)(2) clearly establish that the supreme court of Alaska is to exercise its independent judgment in determining an appropriate sanction, if any, as to any recommendation made by the commission. In re Robson, 500 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The supreme court’s scope of review in a judicial qualifications proceeding should be that of an independent evaluation of the evidence. In re Hanson, 532 P.2d 303 (Alaska 1975).

      <p>
       Regarding the scope of review which the supreme court should exercise in reviewing findings of fact of the Commission on Judicial Qualifications (now Commission on Judicial Conduct), there is no reason to depart from the substantial evidence test which has heretofore been employed in reviewing matters coming to the supreme court from administrative agencies and other governmental bodies.

      </p>
      <p>
       Under the discretionary grant of power to the supreme court under this section and AS 22.30.070(c)(2), supreme court review of a particular recommendation by the commission is necessarily broader than the substantial evidence criterion adopted for review of findings of fact made by the commission.

      </p>
      <p>
       In every case concerning the suspension, removal, retirement, or censorship of a judge, the supreme court must insure that procedural due process has been accorded the judicial officer proceeded against and that requisite findings of fact have been made and are supported by substantial evidence. The supreme court is further obligated to decide whether the commission’s recommended sanction is justified by the record and is in accord with the objectives of the commission as reflected in the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions.

      <p>
       Where judicial conduct which had been prejudicial to the administration of justice and had brought the judicial office into disrepute was weighed against the relative judicial inexperience of petitioner at the time, the supreme court concluded that imposition of a more serious sanction than censure would be inappropriate.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the actions of a judge were serious enough infractions to justify its following the censure recommendation of the Commission on Judicial Qualifications (now Commission on Judicial Conduct), the supreme court was of the opinion that given the necessity for the creation of such a commission and the need for enforcement of standards of judicial conduct and canons of judicial ethics, these ends were more fully served by making of record its sanction decision. By making its sanction part of the public record, the supreme court believed that the public’s confidence would be maintained, both in the workings of the commission and in the ability of the judicial branch of government to insure its continued integrity. In re Robson, 500 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1972).

       With the exception of this article, wherever “term” or “service at the pleasure of” appears in the constitutional text originally adopted, the reference is to a period of service for a particular office, thus allowing the drafters to be precise in their terminology. The language of this section and § 4 of this article, on the other hand, applies to any judge of any court the legislature might create, and “term” in that context may intend only the more general, though equally valid, connotation of any limitation on a period of service.

      Supreme court justices and superior court judges while holding office may not practice law, hold office in a political party, or hold any other office or position of profit under the United States, the State, or its political subdivisions. Any supreme court justice or superior court judge filing for another elective public office forfeits his judicial position.

      The prohibition against dual office holding is literally enforced in Alaska. December 27, 1976 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of the prohibition against dual office holding is to guard against conflicts of interest, self-aggrandizement, concentration of power, and dilution of separation of powers in regard to the exercise of the executive, judicial, and legislative functions of the state government. December 27, 1976 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since the Board of Regents of the University of Alaska is not an interbranch commission, a judge may not sit as a regent while holding office. December 27, 1976 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      A judge does not sit on the Board of Regents in a representative capacity of the judicial branch. When he sits as a regent he is not exercising judicial power but rather certain executive powers of control vested in the regents over the state’s sole institution of higher learning. This he may not do. December 27, 1976 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The University Alaska is an instrumentality of the state, and membership on its Board of Regents is necessarily an office under the state. December 27, 1976 Op. Att’y Gen.

         Scope of rule-making power. —

       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court’s rule-making power under this section is explicitly broad and very nearly complete. Citizens Coalition for Tort Reform v. McAlpine, 810 P.2d 162 (Alaska 1991).

         Authority to enact procedures is judicial. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        While the power to create substantive rights is a legislative power, the authority to enact procedures to implement those rights is, by virtue of this section, judicial. Thomas v. State, 566 P.2d 630 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        In Alaska, the supreme court is given exclusive, initial power to make rules governing practice and procedure and they need not look to the legislature’s intentions to discern whether it has attempted to prescribe a different procedure than that contained in a court rule, unless the legislature has acted in the requisite manner to change a rule. Nolan v. Sea Airmotive, 627 P.2d 1035 (Alaska 1981).

       </p>
       <p>
        A reason for placing in the judicial branch of government rather than in the legislature the initial and primary responsibility for making rules of court practice and procedure is that the administration of justice is the day-to-day business of the courts; they are better equipped than a legislature to know the most effective and easiest methods of conducting that business.

        The superior court has no responsibility or authority to promulgate rules of practice and procedure. Lee v. State, 374 P.2d 868 (Alaska 1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section the responsibility for promulgating rules governing practice and procedure in civil and criminal cases in all courts rests with the supreme court. Lee v. State, 374 P.2d 868 (Alaska 1962).

The 1972 session, however, extended 161 days, and when additional periods of time involving attendance at interim legislative committee meetings and the 30 days from the adjournment of sessions were added as required by that section, it was readily apparent that the mandatory continuance provision could have grave consequences on the administration of the judicial system.

         Form of legislative measure changing rules. —

       <p>
        This constitutional provision does not specify the form a legislative measure should take — no wording is required which would indicate that the power to change rules is being exercised. Leege v. Martin, 379 P.2d 447 (Alaska 1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        If wording indicating that a power to change rules is being exercised is not made a requirement, the purpose of the constitutional provision vesting rule-making power in the judiciary will be defeated. Leege v. Martin, 379 P.2d 447 (Alaska 1963).

       </p>
       <p>
        A legislative enactment will not be effective to change court rules of practice and procedure unless the bill specifically states that its purpose is to effect such a change. Leege v. Martin, 379 P.2d 447 (Alaska 1963); Matanuska Maid v. State, 620 P.2d 182 (Alaska 1980), overruled in part, Rosen v. State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy, 689 P.2d 478 (Alaska 1984); see also Nolan v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Unless the specific intent of the legislature to change procedure is expressed in the bill itself, the courts, as a matter of practical necessity, will have to regard procedural changes as unintentional. Leege v. Martin, 379 P.2d 447 (Alaska 1963).

        <b>
         Judicial power to make rules of practice and procedure is not absolute.

Leege v. Martin, 379 P.2d 447 (Alaska 1963); City of Valdez v. Valdez Dev. Co., 506 P.2d 1279 (Alaska 1973).

       <p>
        The constitutional convention was careful to provide that court rules could not be changed as simply as other laws could be enacted. A two-thirds vote of the members elected to each house, rather than a simple majority, is required in order to change rules of practice and procedure. Leege v. Martin, 379 P.2d 447 (Alaska 1963); City of Valdez v. Valdez Dev. Co., 506 P.2d 1279 (Alaska 1973).

       </p>
       <p>
        The public interest litigant exception to Alaska R. Civ. P. 82 is a rule of substantive law, and is not merely procedural, and could be changed by the Legislature without a two-thirds vote; therefore, Chapter 86, SLA 2003, prohibiting discrimination in the awarding of attorney fees and costs in civil actions or appeals involving public interest litigants, which limited application of the public interest litigant exception, is not invalid. State v. Native Village of Nunapitchuk, 156 P.3d 389 (Alaska 2007).

       <p>
        <b>
         The object of the limitation on the legislature
        </b>
        is to prevent unintentional, rash, ill-considered and too easy intervention by the legislature which would ultimately frustrate the sound purpose in giving courts the primary authority and responsibility for regulating their own affairs. Leege v. Martin, 379 P.2d 447 (Alaska 1963).

        Appointment of district court judge to serve as superior court judge pro tempore. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The chief justice’s authority under this section to assign a judge “from one court . . . to another for temporary service,” includes the authority to appoint a judge of the district court to serve as judge of the superior court pro tempore, regardless of the differences that presently exist in the qualifications required by statute for permanent appointment to either of those courts.

        Consecutive short term appointments

       by the chief justice do not rise to the level of permanence, thus exceeding the temporary assignment power. Kochutin v. State, 739 P.2d 170 (Alaska 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where each of the special orders assigning a district court judge is expressly limited in duration or subject matter and none purport to confer upon him all the benefits of regular superior court service, these assignments do not interfere with the legislature’s power to fix the number of superior court judges, nor do they prevent the governor and judicial council from filling a vacancy on the superior court, and they are temporary assignments within the constitutional authority of the chief justice.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Every citizen of the United States who is at least eighteen years of age, who meets registration residency requirements which may be prescribed by law, and who is qualified to vote under this article, may vote in any state or local election. A voter shall have been, immediately preceding the election, a thirty day resident of the election district in which he seeks to vote, except that for purposes of voting for President and Vice President of the United States other residency requirements may be prescribed by law. Additional voting qualifications may be prescribed by law for bond issue elections of political subdivisions.

     <p>
      The amendment, effective October 9, 1966 (4th Legislature’s SJR 1 (1966)), substituted “A voter” for “He” at the beginning of the second sentence, inserted the exception in that sentence and substituted “A voter” for “He” at the beginning of a former third sentence, which was deleted by a 1970 amendment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The first 1970 amendment, effective October 10, 1970 (6th Legislature’s HJR 7 (1969)), substituted “eighteen” for “nineteen” in the first sentence.

     <p>
      The second 1970 amendment, effective October 10, 1970 (6th Legislature’s HJR 51 am S (1970)), deleted a former third sentence which read: “A voter shall be able to read or speak the English language as prescribed by law, unless prevented by physical disability.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The amendment effective October 14, 1972 (7th Legislature’s HJR 126 am S (1972)) inserted “residency” in the first sentence and substituted “thirty day resident” for “for one year a resident of Alaska and for thirty days a resident” in the second sentence.

     </p>
     <p>
      The legislature must have intended that the point of measurement for qualifications other than those of residence be the same as set out in the constitution; that is, the same as the requirements for residence. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 21.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any attempt to determine the eligibility of a voter as to residence (1) in the state and (2) in the election district, at any time other than the date of the election, would be unconstitutional. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 21.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section of the constitution, holding that citizens who meet certain requirements may vote is one of the provisions that would preclude the banning of write-in votes. The other is Alaska Const., art. I, § 2 which states that government originates with the people and is founded on their will. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 30.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any Alaskan qualified to vote under this section may also vote in a borough election without pre-registering. 1965 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 9.
     </p>
     <p>
      The proper construction of this section is that reregistration less than 30 days prior to an election precludes the person from voting only in the district races of his new residency. Thus, if a person reregisters in his new district less than 30 days before an election, he may vote a questioned ballot in his new district, and his votes will be counted as to statewide candidates and issues (and other matters common to both districts). 1982 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 7.

      </p>
      <p>
       It must be assumed that the drafters of our constitution considered that the qualifications for voting stated in this section did not create a classification prohibited by the Declaration of Rights in Alaska Const., art. I, § 1, as the provisions were adopted concurrently. Park v. State, 528 P.2d 785 (Alaska 1974).

       The equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution does not guarantee state voting rights for aliens. Park v. State, 528 P.2d 785 (Alaska 1974).

        Exclusion of nonproperty owners from bond elections. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of a state constitution and statutes which exclude nonproperty owners from elections for the approval of the issuance of general obligation bonds violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. City of City of Phoenix v. Kolodziejski, 399 U.S. 204, 90 S. Ct. 1990, 26 L. Ed. 2d 523 (U.S. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Our decision will apply only to authorizations for general obligation bonds which are not final as of June 23, 1970, the date of this decision. In the case of states authorizing challenges to bond elections within a definite period, all elections held prior to the date of this decision will not be affected by this decision unless a challenge on the grounds sustained by this decision has been or is brought within the period specified by state law. City of City of Phoenix v. Kolodziejski, 399 U.S. 204, 90 S. Ct. 1990, 26 L. Ed. 2d 523 (U.S. 1970).

      <p>
       A post office box or private mail service address is clearly not a voter’s fixed place of habitation and is therefore insufficient to fix voter’s residence within a voting district. Thus, any voter providing such an address as his or her residence would be ineligible to vote unless he or she provided additional information regarding that voter’s residence. Fischer v. Stout, 741 P.2d 217 (Alaska 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Elmendorf Air Force Base is a bounded area wholly within Senate District H. Thus, merely listing “Elmendorf Air Force Base” is sufficient to fix a voter’s residence to a specific locale within District H. Fischer v. Stout, 741 P.2d 217 (Alaska 1987).

       This section and Alaska Const., art. XI, § 4, and art.

      <p>
       It is the intent of the constitution that the function of reapportionment be performed only by the governor with the assistance of the reapportionment board. Wade v. Nolan, 414 P.2d 689 (Alaska 1966) (decided prior to 1998 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       An enlightened construction of this article which permits realization of its fundamental purpose, that reapportionment not be dependent in any manner on legislative initiative and that effective means of enforcement be readily available to any voter, is that its remaining constitutional provisions provide the implied power in the governor and the reapportionment board to reapportion the senate on an interim basis. Wade v. Nolan, 414 P.2d 689 (Alaska 1966) (decided prior to 1998 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the Alaska Constitution makes no provision for reapportionment of the senate, the supreme court has held that on an interim basis until amendment of the Alaska Constitution the governor has the power to reapportion the senate in the same manner as specified by the constitution for the reapportionment of the house.

      When a concentrated area of population, not having a sufficient population to become a district in itself, prefers to be transferred to its adjacent district within the local senate district, the transfer is possible under the constitution, provided that all constitutional requirements for redistricting are met. 1961 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 20 (issued prior to 1998 amendment).
     </p>
     <p>
      The drafters of the constitution put reapportionment in the hands of the governor, acting on the advice of a reapportionment board, and specifically rejected the idea of giving reapportionment to the legislature. 1964 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 4 (issued prior to 1998 amendment).
     </p>
     <p>
      The Alaska constitutional convention reports and minutes indicate that the delegates who drafted this article gave the duty of reapportioning to the governor for one reason: a legislature cannot and should not be expected to properly reapportion itself. 1964 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 4 (issued prior to 1998 amendment).
     </p>
     <p>
      Alaska Const., art. VI, § 4, provides that the house will be apportioned on the “method of equal proportions,” which is a population-based method widely used in reapportionment of Congressional districts. 1964 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 4 (issued prior to 1998 amendment).

       Alaska’s constitution requires that the requisite population total be arrived at by use of the census data.

       The substantial military population present in the state because of military orders and without intention to make Alaska their home can easily give an unbalanced representation to areas abutting their bases. But there is a need for a permanent plan which achieves a level of accuracy of their voting participation which is closer than either including or excluding all military as a class. Egan v.

       Only after a good-faith effort has been made to achieve precise mathematical equality may variances be permitted. And then the state has the burden of justifying in detail each such variance. Egan v. Hammond, 502 P.2d 856 (Alaska 1972) (decided prior to 1998 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       The standard for reapportionment allowed two separate justifications for deviation from the ideal population figures. The first was variance occurring because of uncontrollable factors, despite a good-faith effort to achieve mathematical precision. The second acceptable deviation was that which “the state must justify” — the implication being that while it had been a controllable deviation, other factors “incident to the effectuation of a rational state policy” could be advanced in justification. Egan v. Hammond, 502 P.2d 856 (Alaska 1972) (decided prior to 1998 amendment).

      </p>
      <p>
       Modern developments and improvements in transportation and communications made rather hollow, in the mid-1960’s, most claims that deviations from population-based representation could validly be based solely on geographical considerations. Arguments for allowing such deviations in order to insure effective representation for sparsely settled areas and to prevent legislative districts from becoming so large that the availability of access of citizens to their representatives was impaired were today, for the most part, unconvincing.

       Retention of political boundaries is a legitimate justification for a deviation from ideal district population size in excess of 10%, but this policy must be consistently applied to the state as a whole. Nevertheless, retention of political boundaries may be sufficient justification for such deviation, even though political boundaries have been crossed in creating districts in other parts of the state, where the differences between the retained political subdivision and its outlying communities are sufficiently distinct.

       The 1971 interim reapportionment plan fashioned by the supreme court for the 1972 legislative elections was held unconstitutional since there was no adequate justification offered for the variances which range from +23.35 to -45.93 percent in the house districts, and from +26.14 to -17.2 percent in the senate districts.

        Difficulty of creating districts of equal population under this section. —

      <p>
       The supreme court recognizes the difficulty of creating districts of equal population while also conforming to the Alaska constitutional mandate that the districts “be formed of contiguous and compact territory containing as nearly as practicable a relatively integrated socio-economic area.” Egan v. Hammond, 502 P.2d 856 (Alaska 1972) (decided prior to 1998 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       When Alaska’s geographical, climatical, ethnic, cultural and socio-economical differences are contemplated the task of creating districts of equal population while conforming to this section assumes Herculean proportions commensurate with Alaska’s enormous land area. The problems are multiplied by Alaska’s sparse and widely scattered population and the relative inaccessibility of portions of the state. Surprisingly small changes in district boundaries create large percentage variances from the ideal population. Egan v. Hammond, 502 P.2d 856 (Alaska 1972) (decided prior to 1998 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       When confronted with conditions so different from those of any other single state in the continental United States, it is readily apparent that it becomes well nigh impossible to achieve the mathematical precision of equal proportions which is feasible in those other states.

       Odd-shaped districts may well be the natural result of Alaska’s irregular geometry.

       The drafters of this provision intended that appellate review be in the nature of a de novo proceeding, but without additional evidence being presented. Groh v. Egan, 526 P.2d 863 (Alaska 1974) (decided prior to 1998 amendment).

      <p>
       This section does not confer upon the supreme court the power to decide what is preferable between alternative rational plans. If that were the case, there would be little reason to provide for the governor to promulgate the reapportionment plan after receiving the recommendations of the Advisory Reapportionment Board.

       The constitutional authority to reapportion resides in the executive, not the courts. Groh v. Egan, 526 P.2d 863 (Alaska 1974) (decided prior to 1998 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the governor’s authority to choose census data as a population base was not limited by either the state or the federal constitution, supreme court review was restricted to whether that authority has been exercised in a rational as opposed to an arbitrary manner.

      </p>
      <p>
       It cannot be said that what the supreme court may deem to be an unwise choice of any particular provision of a reapportionment plan from among several reasonable and constitutional alternatives constitutes “error” which would invoke the jurisdiction of the courts.

     </p>
     <p>
      If the rate for religious groups renting a school building during nonschool hours is substantially lower than the rate for secular groups, the difference would be a gift of school property resulting in a “direct benefit” and would be an improper use of money raised by taxation. 1966 Alas.

       The minutes of the constitutional convention reveal that the Committee on Health, Education and Welfare Provisions, in drafting the last sentence of this section, considered the words “direct” and “indirect” and felt that the words “or indirect” after the word “direct” should not be used for the reason that “they would reach out to infinity practically” and shut out the children in private schools from such free care as was being given by the state welfare department to all children.

       The delegates to the constitutional convention and the people who by their vote ratified the constitution left it to the supreme court to decide whether free transportation of children to nonpublic schools would constitute a “direct” benefit to the schools. If they had intended otherwise, the framers of the constitution would have followed the example set by the people of New York and New Jersey and settled the controversial issue by providing in the constitution itself for transportation of school children to nonpublic schools at state expense.

       After the director of the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) made best interest findings when approving the lease of state lands for an oil and gas development project, the state was required to consider the project’s cumulative impacts at the project’s later phases because, (1) at the lease sale phase, DNR could not assess if the maximum benefit of the people of Alaska would be achieved throughout the course of the project since many potential impacts were unknown, so the impacts had to be considered at later phases, and (2) if DNR did not consider cumulative impacts and give timely notice to the public of its assessment, DNR would violate its duty to take a continuing hard look at new information to ensure development of state resources “by making them available for maximum use consistent with the public interest,” under Alaska Const. art.

       An initiative (07WTR3) related to protection of the statewide interest in water quality by limiting the discharge or release of certain toxic pollutants. Because the state has a property-like interest in the waters of the state, and because the waters of the state play a revenue-raising function for the state, the waters of the state are a public asset. Because the initiative sought only to preclude discharges of toxic chemicals and other pollutants harmful to humans and salmon, it did not create an appropriation limiting the legislature’s authority, nor did it constitute special legislation.

       A regulation allocating harvest levels of sockeye salmon did not violate either this section or Article VIII, § 17 of the Alaska Constitution, as the regulation was not arbitrary and capricious, did not create an exclusive right, and the affected fisheries were not “similarly situated”. The regulation reflected an allocation decision authorized under Article VIII, § 4 which the Board of Fisheries must necessarily make between users involved in different fisheries. Gilbert v.

      <p>
       5 AAC 99.010(b) does not implicate the equal access, uniform application, or equal protection clauses of either the Alaska or United States Constitutions. The regulation affects the classification of fisheries, but does not subject any user group to disparate treatment, and it does not affect any individual’s ability to obtain a subsistence permit or to utilize that permit in a subsistence area. It
       merely provides criteria to determine if the use patterns in that specific area support a finding of customary and traditional uses; this regulation does not affect any user’s admission to a user group and none of the criteria are based on residency. Citizens do not have a constitutional right to have a subsistence fishery in their preferred area.

       The game ratio formula described in 5 AAC 92.070(b)(1) is a structurally infirm and ultimately inaccurate method of measuring subsistence hunting permit applicants’ access to alternative food sources; it is not closely related to the state’s interest in ensuring that Alaskans who need to engage in subsistence hunting are able to do so, and, as such, the regulation violates §§ 3, 15, and 17 of article VIII of the Alaska Constitution.

      </p>
      <p>
       A superexclusive use regulation prohibiting fishermen who operate in one of the superexclusive fisheries from participating in any other superexclusive fishery reflects an allocation decision which is both necessary and authorized under Article VIII, § 4 of the Alaska Constitution, and does not violate any of the Article VIII clauses prohibiting exclusive or special privileges to take fish and wildlife.

VIII, § 4, to maintain our fish resources on the sustained yield principle. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 28.

       A superexclusive use regulation prohibiting fishermen who operate in one of the superexclusive fisheries from participating in any other superexclusive fishery reflects an allocation decision which is both necessary and authorized under this section, and does not violate any of the Article VIII clauses prohibiting exclusive or special privileges to take fish and wildlife. State v. Herbert, 803 P.2d 863 (Alaska 1990).

       A regulation allocating harvest levels of sockeye salmon did not violate either Article VIII, § 3 or Article VIII, § 17 of the Alaska Constitution, as the regulation was not arbitrary and capricious, did not create an exclusive right, and the affected fisheries were not “similarly situated”. The regulation reflected an allocation decision authorized under this section, which the Board of Fisheries must necessarily make between users involved in different fisheries. Gilbert v. Dept. of Fish &amp; Game, Bd. of Fisheries, 803 P.2d 391 (Alaska 1990).

State v. Lewis, 559 P.2d 630 (Alaska), cert. denied, 432 U.S. 901, 97 S. Ct. 2943, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1073 (U.S. 1977).

Prior discovery, location, and filing, as prescribed by law, shall establish a prior right to these minerals and also a prior right to permits, leases, and transferable licenses for their extraction. Continuation of these rights shall depend upon the performance of annual labor, or the payment of fees, rents, or royalties, or upon other requirements as may be prescribed by law. Surface uses of land by a mineral claimant shall be limited to those necessary for the extraction or basic processing of the mineral deposits, or for both. Discovery and appropriation shall initiate a right, subject to further requirements of law, to patent of mineral lands if authorized by the State and not prohibited by Congress. The provisions of this section shall apply to all other minerals reserved to the State which by law are declared subject to appropriation.

      1961 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 3.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the language of the White Act (former 48 U.S.C. § 222) the Secretary of Interior was prohibited from granting any exclusive or several right of fishery in favor of the Natives on the Karluk River on Kodiak Island. The court held that the prohibition against granting an exclusive right of fishery applied to commercial fishing by natives equally with fishing companies, and that the secretary could not grant to the occupants of an Indian rservation the privilege of exclusive commercial fishing rights.

       Community harvest permit system for moose and caribou did not violate Alaska Const. art.

Alaska Fish &amp; Wildlife Conservation Fund v. State, 347 P.3d 97 (Alaska 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Community harvest permit condition applies equally to all Alaskans, does not meaningfully limit admission to the user group, and does not discriminate between user groups; all Alaskans are eligible for a community harvest permit; the only requirements are finding a group of other hunters with whom to collaborate and complying with the “applicable customary and traditional use pattern,” and any inconvenience these requirements may pose does not implicate constitutional rights.

        Regulation upheld. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A superexclusive use regulation prohibiting fishermen who operate in one of the superexclusive fisheries from participating in any other superexclusive fishery reflects an allocation decision which is both necessary and authorized under Article VIII, § 4 of the Alaska Constitution, and does not violate any of the Article VIII clauses prohibiting exclusive or special privileges to take fish and wildlife. State v. Herbert, 803 P.2d 863 (Alaska 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A regulation allocating harvest levels of sockeye salmon did not violate either Article VIII, § 3 or Article VIII, § 17 of the Alaska Constitution, as the regulation was not arbitrary and capricious, did not create an exclusive right, and the affected fisheries were not “similarly situated”. The regulation reflected an allocation decision authorized under Article VIII, § 4 which the Board of Fisheries must necessarily make between users involved in different fisheries. Gilbert v. Dept. of Fish &amp; Game, Bd. of Fisheries, 803 P.2d 391 (Alaska 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       5 AAC 99.010(b) does not implicate the equal access, uniform application, or equal protection clauses of either the Alaska or United States Constitutions. The regulation affects the classification of fisheries, but does not subject any user group to disparate treatment, and it does not affect any individual’s ability to obtain a subsistence permit or to utilize that permit in a subsistence area. It
       merely provides criteria to determine if the use patterns in that specific area support a finding of customary and traditional uses; this regulation does not affect any user’s admission to a user group and none of the criteria are based on residency. Citizens do not have a constitutional right to have a subsistence fishery in their preferred area.
       Alaska Fish &amp; Wildlife Conservation Fund v. State, Dep't of Fish &amp; Game, 289 P.3d 903 (Alaska 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly granted the Alaska Board of Game summary judgment upholding its regulations managing caribou hunting because the Board’s “amount reasonably necessary for subsistence” calculation did not implicate or violate the equal access, uniform application, or equal protection clauses of the Alaska Constitution; the Board’s subsistence definition applied equally to all of the State’s citizens. Manning v. Dep't of Fish &amp; Game, 355 P.3d 530 (Alaska 2015), cert. denied, 577 U.S. 1148, 136 S. Ct. 1172, 194 L. Ed. 2d 193 (U.S. 2016).

      <p>
       The game ratio formula described in 5 AAC 92.070(b)(1) is a structurally infirm and ultimately inaccurate method of measuring subsistence hunting permit applicants’ access to alternative food sources; it is not closely related to the state’s interest in ensuring that Alaskans who need to engage in subsistence hunting are able to do so, and, as such, the regulation violates §§ 3, 15, and 17 of article VIII of the Alaska Constitution.

       A superexclusive use regulation prohibiting fishermen who operate in one of the superexclusive fisheries from participating in any other superexclusive fishery reflects an allocation decision which is both necessary and authorized under Article VIII, § 4 of the Alaska Constitution, and does not violate any of the Article VIII clauses prohibiting exclusive or special privileges to take fish and wildlife.

      <p>
       5 AAC 99.010(b) does not implicate the equal access, uniform application, or equal protection clauses of either the Alaska or United States Constitutions. The regulation affects the classification of fisheries, but does not subject any user group to disparate treatment, and it does not affect any individual’s ability to obtain a subsistence permit or to utilize that permit in a subsistence area. It
       merely provides criteria to determine if the use patterns in that specific area support a finding of customary and traditional uses; this regulation does not affect any user’s admission to a user group and none of the criteria are based on residency. Citizens do not have a constitutional right to have a subsistence fishery in their preferred area.

      <p>
       When the Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game limited time for, and then closed, a set net fishery while also increasing drift net fishery time, the uniform application clause was not violated because the order was justified in light of an historically low Kenai River, Alaska, king salmon run and the fact that set netters incidentally harvested substantially more king salmon than drift netters.

       Superior court properly granted the Alaska Board of Game summary judgment upholding its regulations managing caribou hunting because the Board’s “amount reasonably necessary for subsistence” calculation did not implicate or violate the equal access, uniform application, or equal protection clauses of the Alaska Constitution; the Board’s subsistence definition applied equally to all of the State’s citizens.

       Community harvest permit condition applies equally to all Alaskans, does not meaningfully limit admission to the user group, and does not discriminate between user groups; all Alaskans are eligible for a community harvest permit; the only requirements are finding a group of other hunters with whom to collaborate and complying with the “applicable customary and traditional use pattern,” and any inconvenience these requirements may pose does not implicate constitutional rights.

       Requiring the permit-holder of a commercial fishing license to be personally present during fishing operations does not substantially impair the permit-holder’s right to engage in commercial fishing or his right of access to the fishery.

An exception to tax immunity might be appropriate if a government engaged in what is normally a private business such as operating a ski resort, a moving picture theatre, or a swimming pool.” 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 16.
     </p>
     <p>
      State property is not subject to special assessments levied by local subdivisions of the state for improvements which benefit such property. 1966 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 10.
     </p>
     <p>
      Special assessments are usually distinguished from general taxation. Special assessments are levied for improvements which benefit particular individuals or property and are levied with reference to, and in proportion to, the special benefit conferred. General taxes, on the other hand, are imposed for the purpose of raising monies to be expended for governmental purposes without regard to special benefits conferred on a particular group or class of persons or property. 1966 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 10.
     </p>
     <p>
      A constitutional or statutory exemption from taxation is to be taken as an exemption from ordinary taxes, for the general purposes of government, state, county, or municipal; and does not relieve those in whose favor such exemption exists from the obligation to pay special assessments for local improvements which are charged upon property on the theory that such property is specially benefited thereby.
      1966 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 10.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any exemption for state property from special assessment will have to be found separate and apart from this section. The obvious implication of AS

      is that it is the policy of the legislature that public property used for essential public and government purposes is exempt from local special assessments. 1966 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 10.
     </p>
     <p>
      Immunity of state may be waived only by express constitutional or statutory declaration providing that the state shall be subject to particular tax provisions or to its tax statutes generally. 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 16.
     </p>
     <p>
      The immunity of the state from taxation does not exempt third parties dealing with the state from payment of state taxes when the burden of taxation in a particular transaction falls upon that party and not upon the state; however, when the incidence of taxation falls clearly upon the state, there is no obligation on the part of the party dealing with the state to collect and pay over the tax to the state. 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 16.
     </p>
     <p>
      The presumption that state tax laws are intended to apply to private activity only is equally applicable to instrumentalities and political subdivisions of the state. 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 16.
     </p>
     <p>
      Municipal corporations are immune in the same manner and to the same degree as is the state itself. 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 16.
     </p>
     <p>
      All religious property in the state not used for business, rent, or profit is exempt from taxation; however, property of a religious organization used for the production of income is taxable, but even in this situation a proration must be made with regard to the property involved, between those portions being used for business, rent or profit, and those with no such use. 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 15.

       The second sentence of this section only serves to emphasize the alternative wording of the following sentence wherein it is provided that other exemptions of like or different kind may be granted by general law. De Armond v. Alaska State Dev. Corp., 376 P.2d 717 (Alaska 1962).

        The phrase “educational purposes”

      </p>
      <p>
       The term “educational purposes” is in no way delimited, and there is no justification for the supreme court to give to that term anything other than its ordinary meaning. That restrictive definition is a legislative concern seems especially apparent at a time when there is increasing desire for specialized practical education, a proliferation of new kinds of educational institutions, and rapidly changing concepts of mass education. McKee v. Evans, 490 P.2d 1226 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The minutes of the constitutional convention reveal no indication of what was intended to constitute an “educational” purpose, the drafters stating merely that they intended to adopt a “standard” state exemption. Nor has the legislature defined the term as it has done with regard to “religious purposes.” McKee v. Evans, 490 P.2d 1226 (Alaska 1971).

       It is quite clear that what is done out of good will and a desire to add to the improvement of the moral, mental, and physical welfare of the public generally comes within this meaning of the word “charity.” Matanuska-Susitna Borough v. King's Lake Camp, 439 P.2d 441 (Alaska 1968).

      Among the reasons such a prohibition, as is found in this section, was recommended are the following: (1) flexibility of budgeting; (2) financial control; and (3) lack of relationship between the tax and purpose. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 7.
     </p>
     <p>
      Delegates to the constitutional convention were desirous of eliminating dedications so that the legislature would have the greatest flexibility in allocating tax revenues on a basis of need. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 7.
     </p>
     <p>
      A dedication encompasses (1) proceeds or part of the proceeds of a tax or license (2) set aside at a certain rate (3) for a particular purpose. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 7.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a matter of compromise, a grandfather clause was included in this section to permit all dedications existing on the date of ratification of the constitution (April 24, 1956) to continue. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 7.
     </p>
     <p>
      The intent of the drafters of the state constitution was to permit the continuance of existing dedications at the then existing rates until the legislature saw fit to exercise the only power retained in relation to them: That is, the power to repeal. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 7.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any attempted alteration short of repeal is a nullity. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 7.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prohibition against dedications should be read in conjunction with Alaska Const., art. XI, § 7, which deals with restrictions on the initiative and referendum. Therein it is stated that the initiative and referendum shall not be used to create or apply to dedications of “revenue.” 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 7.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any attempted dedication of funds after April 26, 1956, which was not absolutely required for participation in federal programs, had to be covered into the general fund, any statute notwithstanding. 1959 Op. Att’y Gen. No. 7, issued prior to the 1977 amendment of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any repeal or repeal and re-enactment of a dedication during the 1957 session takes the dedication from under the protection of the grandfather clause, and a re-enactment either in 1957 or later is a nullity unless the dedication is required by the federal government for participation in federal programs. 1959 Op. Att’y Gen., No. 7, issued prior to the 1977 amendment of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Existing dedications may be continued but may not be revised upward or downward by means of altering the tax, the rate of dedication or the purpose for which the dedication will be used. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 7; 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 9; 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 14.
     </p>
     <p>
      No action of the legislature is permissible which would (1) tend to increase or decrease the percentage of the total tax and license proceeds which are dedicated, or (2) which would tend to increase or decrease the amount of proceeds which are dedicated. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 7; 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 14.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the tax is lowered the entire dedication falls and all tax proceeds are covered into the general fund. This result is compelled by a realization that the lowering of the tax irretrievably lowers the dedication because insufficient revenues are available to maintain the present rate of the dedication. Since the only power retained by the legislature with respect to a dedication (other than administrative alterations in the management of the dedication) is the power of repeal, such irretrievable action is tantamount to a repeal of the dedication. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 14.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the legislature raises the tax, the excess tax simply goes into the general fund. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 14.

      , which reduced the tax on motor fuel used in commercial fishing crafts for purposes of commercial fishing from five cents to two cents per gallon, effected no change in the dedication inasmuch as the reduction in the tax is coupled with an exemption from the refund of three cents per gallon formerly allowed to users of fuel in commercial fishing craft for commercial purposes. Nothing has been done which increases or decreases the dedication. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 14.

     </p>
     <p>
      If the moneys in the general fund must be applied in a particular way and the amount to be applied is determined by a set formula, rather than by each legislature’s judgment, the intent of this section has been thwarted. The legislature’s hands are tied as effectively as in the case where the proceeds of a particular tax are dedicated. 1969 Op. Att’y Gen. No. 5, overruled in part on other grounds, May 2, 1975 Op.

      This section of the state constitution can be given its intended effect and serve its repeatedly expressed purpose only if the words “proceeds of any tax or license” are interpreted to mean what their framers clearly intended, i.e., the sources of any public revenues.

      Dedication of the revenues from the lease or sale of state natural resources offends the state constitutional prohibition against dedicated funds. May 2, 1975 Op. Att’y Gen.

      The prohibition of this section is against new dedications, i.e., those dedications of revenues which did not exist on April 24, 1956, the date of the constitution’s ratification. June 2, 1978 Op. Att’y Gen.

      Legislation developed to eliminate the double fee paid by commercial fishermen who are also holders of limited entry permits, which in effect, exempted permit holders from license fees and provided for payment into the fishermen’s fund from moneys collected for permit fees of an amount equal to the amount which would have been paid into the fund from collections for commercial fishing licenses offends this section since it did not continue an existing dedication. June 2, 1978, Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      A dedication is not repealed in its entirety by the partial elimination of its source but rather that it is reduced to provide for a dedication solely from all that is left of the source. June 2, 1978 Op. Att’y Gen.

      The Violent Crimes Compensation Board is authorized by statute to recover, receive, and collect receipts; however, under the Alaska Constitution, all receipts must revert to the general fund. September 25, 1980 Op. Att’y Gen.

     <p>
      The practice of appropriating to a separate fund an amount to be ascertained by reference to receipts from a specified source does not violate the dedication prohibition of the constitution. November 30, 1982 Op. Att’y Gen.

      Language of this section prohibiting dedication of proceeds of any state tax or license must be read as embodying certain implied exceptions, specifically, pension contributions, proceeds from bond issues, sinking fund receipts, revolving fund receipts, contributions from local government units for state-local cooperative programs, and tax receipts which the state might collect on behalf of local government units. November 30, 1982 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is no unlawful dedication involved in the return to a revolving loan fund of principal payments on loans. The initial appropriation would suffice to authorize the use of that money for other loans until the legislature reappropriates the unobligated assets of the fund or abolishes the fund. November 30, 1982 Op. Att’y Gen.

        Valid reasons for differentiating certain appropriations from public revenues. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are valid reasons for differentiating between debt financing and other appropriations from public revenues. First, the check on the power of the legislature that lies in the people means there is less need for the executive to have a “strong control on the purse strings.” Second, the purposes are quite often different. Third, the executive still has the power to veto any bill in its entirety. Thomas v. Rosen, 569 P.2d 793 (Alaska 1977).

      <p>
       <b>
        In special obligation bonding, the general taxing power of the state is not pledged.
       </b>
       The bonds are paid by revenues generated by the project. In such a case, the “purse” of the state would be only slightly affected — only by the moneys required to float the bond, which is usually paid back out of the special fund. In such circumstances, where there is a check on the legislature’s discretion coming directly from the people and repayment coming directly from the project, there is little need for the extraordinary executive power of the line item veto.

       The constitutional convention evidenced a clear intent to protect the financial integrity of all political subdivisions, and limiting the purposes for which they could incur indebtedness to capital improvements was one means selected. City of Juneau v. Hixson, 373 P.2d 743 (Alaska 1962).

      <p>
       The limitation on the purposes for which political subdivisions could incur indebtedness was not intended to permit incurring indebtedness to accomplish all desirable improvements sponsored by the governing body and approved by the electorate. If this had been the intent, it would have been clearly stated by simply omitting the word “capital.” City of Juneau v. Hixson, 373 P.2d 743 (Alaska 1962).

        Meaning of “capital.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       “Capital” seems generally to be associated with value represented by real or personal property in some form and with relative permanency. City of Juneau v. Hixson, 373 P.2d 743 (Alaska 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Capital” was used in the sense in which it is associated with assets in the form of real or personal property and it was intended to connote a degree of permanency. City of Juneau v. Hixson, 373 P.2d 743 (Alaska 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Capital” includes the “public works of a permanent character” such as “streets, bridges, wharves and harbor facilities, sewers and sewage disposal plants, municipal buildings, schools, libraries, gymnasia and athletic fields, fire houses, and public utilities” as mentioned in the original act of Congress (49 Stat. 1388) authorizing municipal corporations in Alaska to incur bonded indebtedness. City of Juneau v. Hixson, 373 P.2d 743 (Alaska 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Capital” included “off-street parking facilities” and “public works or facilities of a permanent character” as provided in former AS 29.50.010. City of Juneau v. Hixson, 373 P.2d 743 (Alaska 1962).

        “Capital improvements” includes projects historically associated with municipal bonding. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In selecting the term “capital improvements” the constitutional convention had in mind that it was including all the projects which had historically been associated with municipal bonding, but under a better generic term — one which did not require illustration by actually listing the type projects that were considered to be included within its meaning and stating that the list itself was not exclusive as was done in the original act of Congress (49 Stat. 1388) authorizing municipal corporations in the territory of Alaska to incur bonded indebtedness. City of Juneau v. Hixson, 373 P.2d 743 (Alaska 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing in the history of municipal bonding in Alaska, or in the minutes of the constitutional convention that indicates that the term “capital improvements” was intended to denote projects radically different than those for which municipalities had been permitted to incur bonded indebtedness in the past.

       The legislature enacted former AS 29.50.010 to supplement this section and did not intend to attempt to substitute a different purpose than that established by “capital improvements” in the constitution. City of Juneau v. Hixson, 373 P.2d 743 (Alaska 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature considered “public works or facilities of a permanent nature” to be synonymous with, or at least included within the meaning of, “capital improvements.” City of Juneau v. Hixson, 373 P.2d 743 (Alaska 1962).

       A proposal by the city of Juneau to issue general obligation bonds for the purpose of providing land without cost to the state as a site for expansion of the State Capitol Center Site and for a site for its capitol which is convenient in location, adequate in size and practical in operating economy, was not a capital improvement and could not be financed on borrowed money.

      If the legislature enacts any other distribution program which is consistent with the intent of the permanent fund dividend law (AS 43.23), any appropriation to implement that program will be exempt from the appropriation limit of § 16, art. IX, of the state constitution. 1983 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 01.
     </p>
     <p>
      The appropriation limit of section 16 of this article must be interpreted consistently with the permanent fund amendment contained in this section. Each legislature may reexamine existing law and enact different laws providing for the use of income earned by the Alaska permanent fund. If section 16 were interpreted so that the exception for permanent fund dividends applied only to appropriations to finance cash dividends under AS 43.23, the legislature would essentially be denied the flexibility to adjust to changing philosophies concerning the propriety of making cash payments directly to residents, which this section expressly reserves to it. 1983 Alas.

       Superior court properly decided a political dispute about the Alaska permanent fund dividend program in favor of the State and the Alaska permanent fund Corporation because the plain language of the 1976 amendment to the state constitution did not exempt the legislature's use of permanent fund income from the Constitution's anti-dedication clause, the legislature's use of permanent fund income was subject to normal appropriation and veto budgetary processes, and the governor validly exercised his veto authority to reduce the legislatively authorized transfer from the earnings reserve to the dividend fund and did not alter the legislature's purpose.

       Section 16. Appropriation Limit.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Except for appropriations for Alaska permanent fund dividends, appropriations of revenue bond proceeds, appropriations required to pay the principal and interest on general obligation bonds, and appropriations of money received from a non-State source in trust for a specific purpose, including revenues of a public enterprise or public corporation of the State that issues revenue bonds, appropriations from the treasury made for a fiscal year shall not exceed $2,500,000,000 by more than the cumulative change, derived from federal indices as prescribed by law, in population and inflation since July 1, 1981. Within this limit, at least one-third shall be reserved for capital projects and loan appropriations. The legislature may exceed this limit in bills for appropriations to the Alaska permanent fund and in bills for appropriations for capital projects, whether of bond proceeds or otherwise, if each bill is approved by the governor, or passed by affirmative vote of three-fourths of the membership of the legislature over a veto or item veto, or becomes law without signature, and is also approved by the voters as prescribed by law. Each bill for appropriations for capital projects in excess of the limit shall be confined to capital projects of the same type, and the voters shall, as provided by law, be informed of the cost of operations and maintenance of the capital projects. No other appropriation in excess of this limit may be made except to meet a state of disaster declared by the governor as prescribed by law. The governor shall cause any unexpended and unappropriated balance to be invested so as to yield competitive market rates to the treasury.

      This section imposes an appropriation limit rather than a spending limit. The legislature may make appropriations which exceed available revenues, but obligations may not be paid under those appropriations unless there is enough surplus money available in the treasury. 1983 Alas.

      If the legislature enacts any other distribution program which is consistent with the intent of the permanent fund dividend law (AS 43.23), any appropriation to implement that program will be exempt from the appropriation limit of this section. 1983 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 01.

      If the legislature provides that an appropriation may not be expended until a later fiscal year, the appropriation should be counted only against the limit for that later fiscal year. 1983 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 01.

      The one-third appropriation allocation reserved for capital projects and loan appropriations may be disregarded when economic conditions impose a total appropriation limit which is more restrictive than that set out in this section. 1983 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 01.
     </p>
     <p>
      Appropriations that are available for expenditure in a fiscal year should be counted only against the appropriation limit of this section for the first fiscal year during which they could be completely expended. This should be done even if an unexpended balance is carried forward into the next fiscal year; that balance must be considered obligated for the purposes of the appropriation limit. 1983 Alas. Op.

       Treating non-monetary asset transfers as appropriations is not only inconsistent with the language of Alaska Const., art. IX, § 16, but it poses the further problem of how to calculate the value of such asset transfers to ensure that they fall within the appropriations limits imposed by the Alaska Constitution. In expressing the limit in dollars, Alaska Const., art. IX, § 16 reflects a constitutional structure that treats “appropriations” as dealing exclusively with money transfers.

       There is established as a separate fund in the State treasury the budget reserve fund. Except for money deposited into the permanent fund under Section 15 of this article, all money received by the State after July 1, 1990, as a result of the termination, through settlement or otherwise, of an administrative proceeding or of litigation in a State or federal court involving mineral lease bonuses, rentals, royalties, royalty sale proceeds, federal mineral revenue sharing payments or bonuses, or involving taxes imposed on mineral income, production, or property, shall be deposited in the budget reserve fund. Money in the budget reserve fund shall be invested so as to yield competitive market rates to the fund. Income of the fund shall be retained in the fund. Section 7 of this article does not apply to deposits made to the fund under this subsection. Money may be appropriated from the fund only as authorized under (b) or (c) of this section.

       If the amount available for appropriation for a fiscal year is less than the amount appropriated for the previous fiscal year, an appropriation may be made from the budget reserve fund. However, the amount appropriated from the fund under this subsection may not exceed the amount necessary, when added to other funds available for appropriation, to provide for total appropriations equal to the amount of appropriations made in the previous calendar year for the previous fiscal year.

       A municipal ordinance is not necessarily invalid in Alaska because it is inconsistent or in conflict with a state statute. The question rests on whether the exercise of authority has been prohibited to municipalities. Jefferson v. State, 527 P.2d 37 (Alaska 1974); City of Anchorage v.

       The meaning of this section is that, where a home rule city is concerned, the charter and not a legislative act is looked to in order to determine whether a particular power has been conferred upon the city. It would be incongruous to recognize the constitutional provision stating that a home rule city “may exercise all legislative powers not prohibited by law or by charter” (Alaska Const., art. X, § 11), and then to say that the power of a home rule city is measured by a legislative act. Lien v. City of Ketchikan, 383 P.2d 721 (Alaska 1963).

        The advantage of the method proposed,
       </b>
       in the words of the committee on local government, “ . . . lies in placing the process at a level where area-wide or state-wide needs can be taken into account. By placing authority in this third-party, arguments for and against boundary change can be analyzed objectively.” Fairview Pub. Util. Dist. v. City of Anchorage, 368 P.2d 540 (Alaska), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 5, 83 S. Ct. 39, 9 L. Ed. 2d 49 (U.S. 1962).

       The relevant minutes of the meetings of the committee on local government show clearly the concept that was in mind when this section was being considered: That local political decisions do not usually create proper boundaries and that boundaries should be established at the state level.

      The word “acts,” as used in the referendum provisions of this article, refers to an entire act of the legislature and not to sections of acts.
      1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 18.
     </p>
     <p>
      The referendum is a veto power analogous to the veto power vested in the governor by Alaska Const., art. II, § 15. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 18.
     </p>
     <p>
      The referendum and the veto power serve similar functions in legislative process; hence, the limitations of one apply to the other except as distinctions are specified in the constitution. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 18.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of the veto is to prevent the adoption of the undesirable legislation; the veto power is not a power to change the effect of proposed laws or to do anything concerning them except to approve or disapprove them as a whole. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 18.
     </p>
     <p>
      The veto power may be exercised only against entire bills, and it may not be exercised upon sections of bills except in the case of appropriation bills. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 18.
     </p>
     <p>
      Were the referendum interpreted as extending to sections of act, its avowed purpose to approve or disapprove acts would be frustrated. It would in many cases result in exactly that which it is not intended to do. It would change the effect of a proposed law, and frustrate the legislative purpose. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 18.
     </p>
     <p>
      An initiative may be used to repeal a law since to read this section so as to sever the power to repeal from the initiative, thus eliminating popular votes on previous initiatives, on statutes not subject to referendum, i.e., those for which the time limit has passed, and on parts of statutes as opposed to an entire enactment, is illogical given the very intent, subject to express exceptions, to vest the voting public with legislative power equal to the legislature’s power. April 14, 1975 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the context of this article, the referendum has a restricted scope of operation: First, a referendum may only reject “acts of the legislature” and not acts by initiative; second, a referendum may address only acts passed by an immediately preceding legislative session; and third, a referendum may reject only entire acts of the legislature and not sections thereof. Thus, unless a law sought to be rejected falls within the ambit of the “acts” described, a referendum is unavailable. April 14, 1975 Op. Att’y Gen.

      The word “form” is the antithesis of the word “substance.” Substance is that which is essential in content and goes to the merits of the issue. Substance pertains to matters which affect the basic rights of parties. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 35.

      The lieutenant governor acts in a ministerial capacity. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 35.

     <p>
      The lieutenant governor can make such inquiry and investigation as to the voting qualifications of individual signers of an initiative application as appears reasonably necessary in his discretion, but he may look only at form and not the substance of an application. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 35. But see Boucher v. Engstrom, 528 P.2d 456 (Alaska 1974), overruled, McAlpine v. University of Alaska, 762 P.2d 81 (Alaska 1988).

     <p>
      The requirement that the lieutenant governor certify as to the form of the application under this section would be meaningless if the general provisions of Alaska Const., art. II, § 13 did not apply. There would be nothing to certify to since the article on initiative sets out no particular form of an initiative. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 36.

      This article is rather unique in that it provides for two separate stages in the preparing of an initiative or referendum for submission to the electorate. Before circulating a petition, the proponents of an initiative or referendum must first circulate an application “containing the bill to be initiated or the act to be referred” and obtain the signatures of not less than one hundred qualified voters as sponsors of the application. 1963 Alas.

      The application for referendum petition submitted was not in proper form and it was necessary for the proponents of the measure to prepare an application containing the text of ch. 52, SLA 1963, and secure the necessary number of signatures to this application before they could validly prepare a petition for circulation under Alaska Const., art. XI, § 3. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 17.

       In preparing summary of subject matter of proposed bill, the lieutenant governor is entitled to rely on the premise that readers of the summary understand that in the absence of explicit language to the contrary, state initiatives are intended to change state law and bind the state government, not federal law and the federal government; thus he need not give “special” reminders to the voters regarding the scope of a state initiative.

       As originally introduced, this section provided that laws proposed by the initiative shall be submitted to the voters “at an election not later than 180 days after the adjournment of the legislative session following the filing of the petition.” This proposal was amended before adoption to read as it does now. The purpose of the amendment, as explained by one of its sponsors, was to do away with the high costs of special elections for such matters (estimated at $40,000), by requiring that the initiative proposition go on the ballot at a statewide election, whether it be primary or a general election or a special election called for some other purpose.

      </p>
      <p>
       This section was not designed with the objective of depriving the people of the right to vote if by reason of circumstances, such as an injunction preventing the secretary of state [now lieutenant governor] from placing an initiative proposition on the ballot, it became impossible to submit the proposition at the “first” statewide election held within the prescribed time.

        The words “substantial” or “substantially”

      </p>
      <p>
       The term “substantially the same measure” must be viewed against the total structure contemplated in this article in the matter of direct legislation. Warren v. Boucher, 543 P.2d 731 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       Alaska Constitution contains no explicit limitation on the legislature’s power to amend an initiative enacted by the voters, but it does contain such a limitation on the legislature’s power to avoid a proposed initiative. Legislation designed to avoid a vote on a proposed initiative must be “substantially the same” as the initiative. The history related to the adoption of article 6, section 4 reflects the framers’ concern that the legislature be given only “the power to amend and not the power to destroy.” Thus, even amendments to popularly-initiated legislation must still “effectuate[ ] the intent of the electorate,” and an amendment that “so vitiates an act passed by initiative as to constitute its repeal“ is not acceptable.

       It is not necessary that the two measures correspond in minor particulars, or even as to all major features, if the subject matter is necessarily complex or if it requires comprehensive treatment. Warren v. Boucher, 543 P.2d 731 (Alaska 1975).

       Section 6. Enactment.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If a majority of the votes cast on the proposition favor its adoption, the initiated measure is enacted. If a majority of the votes cast on the proposition favor the rejection of an act referred, it is rejected. The lieutenant governor shall certify the election returns. An initiated law becomes effective ninety days after certification, is not subject to veto, and may not be repealed by the legislature within two years of its effective date. It may be amended at any time. An act rejected by referendum is void thirty days after certification. Additional procedures for the initiative and referendum may be prescribed by law.

        Because Alaska Const., art.

        A 1978 initiative entitled “The Alaska Homestead Act” would have substantially depleted the state government of valuable assets just as surely as an initiative allotting to residents of specified years large sums of money.

        The fact that a survey might be costly did not change the essential nature of a 1978 initiative entitled “The Alaska Homestead Act” as an appropriations initiative. The applicant would have paid the surveyor; no compensation or service was rendered to the state. The stated purpose and effect of the initiative on the state treasury would still be an expenditure of state assets in the form of public lands. Thomas v. Bailey, 595 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1979).

        , 215 P.3d 1064 (Alaska 2009), to its logical conclusion would be to allow any initiative regulating public assets to go before the voters so long as it would not wholly usurp the legislature's allocation function. But that is not where the delegates intended to draw the line between permissible regulation and impermissible appropriation. Instead, an initiative must leave to the legislature ultimate decision-making authority to use specific public assets for specific purposes.
        Mallott v. Stand for Salmon, 431 P.3d 159 (Alaska 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        When determining whether an initiative effects an appropriation, the proper analysis should focus on the two core objectives identified in case law. An initiative is an impermissible give-away program if it transfers state assets into private hands. An initiative also effects an appropriation if it infringes on the legislature's ability to allocate resources among competing uses, that is, if it fails to ensure that the legislature, and only the legislature, retains control over the allocation of state assets among competing needs, by forcing the legislature to make a particular allocation decision in the future or by removing certain allocation decisions from the legislature's range of discretion.

       <p>
        The term “appropriation” includes the setting aside of property other than money. Hence, the provision in an initiative transferring from the University of Alaska to the community college system of Alaska such real and personal property as was necessary to the independent operation and maintenance of the community college system, could be deemed to be an appropriation and, therefore, violative of this section.

       <p>
        Although laws which merely create new government programs or liabilities do not constitute appropriations, the provision of an initiative which transferred funds from the University of Alaska to the community college system of Alaska was an appropriation, since it designated the use of state assets in a manner which was executable, mandatory, and reasonably definite with no further legislative action.

        Sufficiency of application. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Court properly granted a recall committee's application for recalling the governor because it satisfied the legal requirements for presentation to the voters; the application alleged, inter alia, that the governor abused the discretionary power to apply the line-item veto to appropriations bills and to decrease legislative appropriations, it alleged that the governor made a mistaken veto, and while the governor's "legal" or "proper" exercise of discretion could not establish a for-cause ground for recall, the specific allegation was that the governor was not making a conscious decision but rather "acted incompetently" and made a mistake, later corrected. State v. Dunleavy, 491 P.3d 343 (Alaska 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       Reversal of the denial of the citizen’s application for a petition to recall a member of the city assembly was proper because the clerk applied an inaccurate definition of “misconduct in office” in determining that the application was insufficient; requiring misconduct in office to be criminal would undermine the intent and effectiveness of the recall statutes and would deny the voters’ right to effectively seek recall of their elected officials.

      </p>
      <p>
       Key determination for whether an individual has standing to claim protection is whether they have a vested right to a benefit generated by membership in the State's public retirement systems; the Constitution protects the rights of those who accrued benefits due to their membership in a State employee retirement system, and whether or not an individual is a "member," an individual with an accrued benefit has a constitutional right that the benefit not be diminished or impaired by legislation. Metcalfe v. State, 484 P.3d 93 (Alaska 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       Primary purposes of state employee retirement systems is to induce persons to enter and continue in public service, and this inducement works in the long term only if employees can trust the State's promise that the accrued benefits of system membership will not be diminished or impaired; the Alaska Constitution ensures that the State's promises are kept.

       There is no valid basis upon which to distinguish the rights of elected officials in the elected public officers retirement system from their rights in the public employees’ retirement system in the context of this section. State ex rel. Hammond v. Allen, 625 P.2d 844 (Alaska 1981).

       The elected public officers retirement system constitutes a contractual relationship between participants in that program and the state of Alaska, which must be honored by the state. Therefore, all elected officials who were participating in the elected public officers retirement system at the time its repeal became effective [October 14, 1976] will be entitled to the benefits provided by that system upon retirement.

       Public employee had no right to diminution of value damages based on a claim that a statutory amendment was a breach of the employee's Alaska Public Employees' Retirement System contract.

       Term “accrued benefits” is not limited to just the benefits that were provided to public employees at the time of ratification of the constitution. Instead, the term includes all retirement benefits that make up the retirement benefit package that becomes part of the contract of employment when the public employee is hired, including health insurance benefits. Duncan v. Retired Pub. Emples. of Alaska, Inc., 71 P.3d 882 (Alaska 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Repeal of the statutory right of reinstatement diminished a former State employee's accrued benefits because the benefit became an "accrued benefit" as soon as the former employee became employed and enrolled in the Public Employees' Retirement System; the former employee and other persons considering the advantages and disadvantages of State employment while the statute was in effect, could reasonably rely on it when making important employment decisions. Metcalfe v. State, 484 P.3d 93 (Alaska 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the State held out the option to purchase its dental insurance plan to employees as part of their retirement benefits package, that option qualified as an accrued benefit and was constitutionally protected from diminishment; the State had long held out the option to purchase its Dental-Visual-Audio insurance plan as part of the package of retirement benefits tendered to public employees in exchange for their performance of services, and an option to purchase it in the future had value.

        Analysis of changes to benefits. —

      <p>
       State supreme court vacated the grant of the retirees’ summary judgment to the extent that it required the analysis of the disadvantages and compensating advantages of changes to health insurance benefits be made by focusing on individuals as opposed to the entire group of employees. Duncan v. Retired Pub. Emples. of Alaska, Inc., 71 P.3d 882 (Alaska 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court erred in concluding the State’s redesigned dental insurance plan unconstitutionally diminished retirees’ accrued benefits because it failed to consider the reduction in premiums paid by retirees as an advantage in the diminishment analysis; deeming premiums categorically irrelevant to the diminishment analysis, the superior court did not consider whether the premium decrease, alongside the coverage increases, could have offset the disadvantages of the coverage decreases. State v. Retired Pub. Emples. of Alaska, Inc., 502 P.3d 422 (Alaska 2022).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the State held out the option to purchase its Dental-Visual-Audio insurance insurance plan to employees as part of their retirement benefits package, the Alaska Constitution protects this option from diminishment; because this option’s value is affected by both the plan’s coverage and purchase price, analysis of its potential diminishment should incorporate both these dimensions. State v. Retired Pub. Emples. of Alaska, Inc., 502 P.3d 422 (Alaska 2022).
      </p>
      <p>
       To the holder of an option contract, a lower purchase price is clearly an advantage., and to retirees with an option to buy into an insurance plan, lower premiums are also clearly an advantage; thus, when premiums are paid by retirees, decreases in premiums should be considered relevant to the value of the benefit. State v. Retired Pub. Emples. of Alaska, Inc., 502 P.3d 422 (Alaska 2022).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the anti-diminishment provision, modifications to vested benefits are permissible only if new disadvantages to employees are offset by new advantages, resulting in benefits of “equivalent value” to employees, and value is the touchstone of this analysis; when the accrued benefit in question is an option to purchase an insurance plan, the services covered by that plan are relevant to the benefit’s value. State v. Retired Pub. Emples. of Alaska, Inc., 502 P.3d 422 (Alaska 2022).
      </p>
      <p>
       Benefit’s value must be proven by reliable evidence, and offsetting advantages and disadvantages should be established under the group approach by solid, statistical data drawn from actual experience, including accepted actuarial sources, rather than by unsupported hypothetical projections; the plaintiff claiming a constitutional violation has the burden to show that the plan’s value has diminished.

      The State of Alaska and its people forever disclaim all right and title in or to any property belonging to the United States or subject to its disposition, and not granted or confirmed to the State or its political subdivisions, by or under the act admitting Alaska to the Union. The State and its people further disclaim all right or title in or to any property, including fishing rights, the right or title to which may be held by or for any Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut, or community thereof, as that right or title is defined in the act of admission. The State and its people agree that, unless otherwise provided by Congress, the property, as described in this section, shall remain subject to the absolute disposition of the United States. They further agree that no taxes will be imposed upon any such property, until otherwise provided by the Congress. This tax exemption shall not apply to property held by individuals in fee without restrictions on alienation.

      <p>
       Section 4 of the Alaska Statehood Act (72 Stat. 339, as amended, 48 USC Prec. § 23) is a direct response by Congress to the provisions contained in the five sentences of this section. The two sections constitute a compact between sovereigns. Metlakatla Indian Community v. Egan, 362 P.2d 901 (Alaska 1961), vacated in part, 369 U.S. 45, 82 S. Ct. 552, 7 L.

       A comparison of the offer, in the first sentence of this section, with the response in § 4 of the Alaska Statehood Act indicates definite agreement as to the future status of United States property. Metlakatla Indian Community v. Egan, 362 P.2d 901 (Alaska 1961), vacated in part, 369 U.S. 45, 82 S. Ct. 552, 7 L. Ed. 2d 562 (U.S. 1962), aff'd in part, 369 U.S. 60, 82 S. Ct. 562, 7 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       The fourth and fifth sentences of this section and the response in § 4 of the Alaska Statehood Act appear to have sufficient definiteness to be offers and acceptances. Metlakatla Indian Community v. Egan, 362 P.2d 901 (Alaska 1961), vacated in part, 369 U.S. 45, 82 S. Ct. 552, 7 L. Ed. 2d 562 (U.S. 1962), aff'd in part, 369 U.S. 60, 82 S. Ct. 562, 7 L.

      <p>
       A comparison between the offer in the second sentence of this section and the response in § 4 of the Alaska Statehood Act does not indicate definite agreement. The offer to disclaim by the state was conditioned on definition in the act of admission of the right or title to be disclaimed. The response merely repeated the offer to disclaim. It did not comply with the condition by defining the right or title. Metlakatla Indian Community v. Egan, 362 P.2d 901 (Alaska 1961), vacated in part, 369 U.S. 45, 82 S. Ct. 552, 7 L.

       between the State of Alaska and the United States by the second sentence of this section and the responsive portion of § 4 of the Alaska Statehood Act. This is because no fishing rights were defined, as required by the condition in the offer to disclaim, and no fishing rights were “held” by or for natives at the time. Metlakatla Indian Community v. Egan, 362 P.2d 901 (Alaska 1961), vacated in part, 369 U.S. 45, 82 S. Ct. 552, 7 L. Ed. 2d 562 (U.S. 1962), aff'd in part, 369 U.S. 60, 82 S. Ct. 562, 7 L. Ed. 2d 573 (U.S. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       No act of Congress had established any “right or title” in fishing rights which were “held” by or for natives at the time the compact was made. Metlakatla Indian Community v. Egan, 362 P.2d 901 (Alaska 1961), vacated in part, 369 U.S. 45, 82 S. Ct. 552, 7 L. Ed. 2d 562 (U.S. 1962), aff'd in part, 369 U.S. 60, 82 S. Ct. 562, 7 L. Ed. 2d 573 (U.S. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the second sentence of this section the state offered to disclaim as to right or title “held” by or for the persons named. The response in the Alaska Statehood Act described the right or title as “held” by or for natives. There is no evidence of an intent on the part of either sovereign that any new or additional rights in fishing rights be established by the compact itself. Metlakatla Indian Community v. Egan, 362 P.2d 901 (Alaska 1961), vacated in part, 369 U.S. 45, 82 S. Ct. 552, 7 L. Ed. 2d 562 (U.S. 1962), aff'd in part, 369 U.S. 60, 82 S. Ct. 562, 7 L. Ed. 2d 573 (U.S. 1962).

       Chapter 19, SLA 1976, which authorized a three-way exchange of land between the state of Alaska, the United States government and a regional corporation of Alaska natives, which exchange was to pass all of the state’s rights in the land including the mineral subsurface estate, was constitutional since there is no constitutional prohibition against alienation of mineral rights which precludes this land exchange.

       The objective that park lands are to be managed in a way that will increase “the value of a recreational experience” is incompatible with the objective of using university land for the “exclusive use and benefit” of the University of Alaska, since the implied intent of the grant was to maximize the economic return from the land for the benefit of the university and this intent cannot be accomplished if the use of the land is restricted to any significant degree.

      A federal statute or proposed federal statute that affects an interest of this State under the Act admitting Alaska to the Union is ineffective as against the State interest unless approved by a two-thirds vote of each house of the legislature or approved by the people of the State.
      The legislature may, by a resolution passed by a majority vote of each house, place the question of approval of the federal statute on the ballot for the next general election unless in the resolution placing the question of approval, the legislature requires the question to be placed before the voters at a special election.
      The approval of the federal statute by the people of the State is not effective unless the federal statute described in the resolution is ratified by a majority of the qualified voters of the State who vote on the question.
      Unless a summary of the question is provided in the resolution passed by the legislature, the lieutenant governor shall prepare an impartial summary of the question.
      The lieutenant governor shall present the question to the voters so that a “yes” vote on the question is a vote to approve the federal statute.

       A ballot measure designed to alter the reapportionment scheme of the state Constitution, although a significant change in the system of state government, did not deprive the executive branch of its foundational power to enforce the laws of the state, and thus the proposal did not constitute a revision.

       In recognition of the distinction between amendments, which contemplate simple change, and revisions, which encompass broader and more comprehensive change, the framers of the state Constitution fashioned more stringent procedures for adopting revisions than for adopting amendments.

       Although included in Alaska Statehood Act, § 8(b), former 48 U.S.C. Prec. § 21, was the provision that in the event that three propositions to be submitted to the voters were adopted by a majority vote, “the proposed constitution of the proposed State of Alaska . . . shall be deemed amended accordingly,” and although the propositions were adopted, the Alaska Constitution was not thereby amended to include “the terms or conditions of the grants of land” set forth in Alaska Statehood Act, § 6(i) since there was no state legislature in existence at the time of passage of the Statehood Act, the territorial legislature never approved an amendment incorporating the restrictions of Alaska Statehood Act, § 6(i), which relates to mineral land grants, into the Alaska Constitution, and no constitutional convention was called to act on the matter.

It was a matter of convenience to designate that place as Juneau, since it had been the capital and seat of government of the territory since 1912. Starr v. Hagglund, 374 P.2d 316 (Alaska 1962).

       This section is subject to change by law because it is of a transitional nature. Starr v. Hagglund, 374 P.2d 316 (Alaska 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section, because of its place in the constitution, the history of its adoption, and its express purpose as stated in the preamble to the article of which it is a part, was a provision not intended to be a permanent and abiding part of the fundamental law of this state which could be changed only by constitutional amendment. Starr v. Hagglund, 374 P.2d 316 (Alaska 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       A transition is a passage or change from one status to another, and once the change has been made, then that which aided in bringing it about has performed its function, and there is no basis for assuming that a transitional measure, such as the provision for a seat of government, should then have any enduring or permanent quality which would make it an integral part of the fundamental structure of government established by the people of Alaska.

      <p>
       The conclusion cannot be reached that because § 1 of this article, and others in the schedule of transitional measures do have express provisions for change by law, and this section does not, that the latter cannot be changed except by constitutional amendment.

       , limiting the commercial use of the state seal, because it is clear that states have the power to protect symbols of their sovereignty, state seals appear to be more akin to trademarks or service marks than they are to the type of work Congress intended copyrights to cover, and it is evident that Congress, by protecting specific important federal seals that were left unprotected by copyright law and by federal trademark law, does not intend to prohibit states from protecting seals that represent state sovereignty.

        Designation of public lands. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a challenge to federal officials’ designation of “public lands” for
       purposes of Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act’s (ANILCA) rural
       subsistence hunting and fishing priority, as there was no shortage of water on
       ANILCA reservations, any need for additional water beyond adjacent waters for
       general wilderness preservation was too remote to require including upstreams
       and downstreams as subject to reserved right; State of Alaska’s prohibition of
       fish traps was evidence of long-running federal-state controversy, but ANILCA
       limited priority to rural subsistence uses, to certain (but not all) public
       lands, and to federal lands, and lands owned by the United States but subject
       to valid State and Native corporation land selections were excluded from the definition of public lands, such that priority for subsistence uses by rural
       residents of Alaska, including both Natives and non-Natives, applied only on
       specified subset of federal lands, with State, Native corporation, and private
       lands expressly excluded from rural subsistence preference regulations. John v. United States, 720 F.3d 1214 (9th Cir. Alaska 2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1042, 134 S. Ct. 1759, 188 L. Ed. 2d 609 (U.S. 2014).
