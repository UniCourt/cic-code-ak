       Where parties were legally married for only 34 months of an eight-year relationship, it was error for the trial court to find that they were married for eight years; the court could consider the entire relationship, including periods of premarital cohabitation, in making a property division, so long as it observed the distinction between assets acquired prior to and during coverture.

       et seq., so the Supreme Court of Alaska looks to common usage, where the word ordinarily refers to a married woman. “Spouse” is commonly known to mean husband or wife; by the same token, “wife” is commonly known to mean “spouse,” or a “married woman,” and “marriage” has been defined by this section of the Alaska Marriage Code.

      <p>
       Benefits programs facially discriminated against same-sex domestic partners by covering married public employees but not domestic partners because, unlike opposite-sex domestic partners, same-sex domestic partners were barred from marriage under Alaska Const. art. I, § 25, as well as subsection (a) of this section, and thus were absolutely precluded from eligibility. The policy was not substantially related to government interests and thus violated equal protection under Alaska Const. art. I, § 1. Alaska Civ. Liberties Union v. State, 122 P.3d 781 (Alaska 2005).

       Alaska’s ban on same-sex marriage and refusal to recognize same-sex marriages lawfully entered in other states as set forth in Alaska Const. art. 1, § 25 and AS §§ 25.05.011, 25.05.013, is unconstitutional as a deprivation of basic due process and equal protection principles under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. No state interest provides exceedingly persuasive justification for the significant infringement of rights that they inflict upon homosexual individuals. Hamby v. Parnell, 56 F. Supp. 3d 1056 (D.

       expressly neither deny nor grant a wife the right to sue her husband, the statutory terminology is broad enough to cover the matter and to enable the wife to bring an action against her husband, during coverture or thereafter, for a tort to her person caused by his negligent conduct while the parties were married to each other.

     <p>
      This section allows a substitute birth certificate when there is legitimization of the child by intermarriage (providing proof is offered that the marriage was between the parents of the child), as well as by court adjudication alone. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 29.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only the third method of legitimation is specifically vested in the court. 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 13.
     </p>
     <p>
      By implication, the Bureau of Vital Statistics has the power and duty to make its own determination of the fulfillment of the first two conditions of legitimation. 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 13.
     </p>
     <p>
      Necessarily involved in legitimation is the administrative determination of illegitimacy at the time an original birth certificate is filed. 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 13.
     </p>
     <p>
      For application of presumption of legitimacy to validity of original birth certificate, see 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 13.
     </p>
     <p>
      For right of child to legitimation procedures, see 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 13.
     </p>
     <p>
      An admission under oath or in writing of paternity in a foreign action could be recognized as satisfying the requirement of subdivision (a)(2) of this section that a father acknowledge his paternity of the child as a method of legitimation. 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 13.
     </p>
     <p>
      The bureau should recognize foreign marriages as sufficient under subdivision (a)(1) of this section to establish a subsequent intermarriage as a basis for legitimation. 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 13.
     </p>
     <p>
      For suggested standards of proof to establish that the man subsequently marrying a mother is the father of her child, for purposes of issuing a substitute birth certificate legitimating the child under subdivision (a)(1), see 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 13.
     </p>
     <p>
      For discussion of what constitutes a sufficient written acknowledgment of paternity under subdivision (a)(2), see 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 13.
     </p>
     <p>
      Erroneous entries in the original birth certificates of children born to unwed mothers naming the father are significant to show a mother’s acknowledgment of paternity corroborating the effect of subsequent intermarriage or written acknowledgment of paternity by the father, if it can be established that the entry was made by the mother or at her request, but such entries have no other evidentiary value. 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 13.
     </p>
     <p>
      Legitimation may be effected by the bureau even though the acknowledged father is married to another woman, under the general policy of the statute. 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 13.

       The filing of an adoption petition does not preclude the biological father from thereafter filing a written acknowledgment of his paternity of the subject child, thereby legitimizing him. In re Adoption of H., 597 P.2d 513 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Interpretation of the relevant statutes precludes additional consideration of the best interests of the child in determining whether a father may legitimize the adoptee during the pendency of an adoption proceeding and so foreclose adoption absent his consent. In re Adoption of H., 597 P.2d 513 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the father produced evidence of justifiable cause for his failure to communicate with the child, who was too young to read or communicate over the telephone, and because the adoptive parents did not meet their burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the father unjustifiably failed to communicate meaningfully with the child for one year, consent for the adoption of the child was required from the father.

      <p>
       There was ample evidence in the record to support a trial court’s finding that the parties could not cooperate to the extent necessary to make a joint custody arrangement work, despite the father’s argument that both his and his wife’s joint concern for their son’s developmental problems, a court-ordered pretrial custody arrangement, and an earlier custody agreement evinced their ability to cooperate for the benefit of the children. Lone Wolf v. Lone Wolf, 741 P.2d 1187 (Alaska 1987).

       The test for evaluating the propriety of joint legal custody is whether or not the parties can cooperate and communicate regarding the children. Farrell v. Farrell, 819 P.2d 896 (Alaska 1991).

       In a child custody case, even though supervised visitation might have been appropriate, it was error for the superior court not to make express findings that specified why unsupervised visitation would have adversely affected the children’s well-being; implications and suggestions were insufficient to support visitation restrictions. It was an abuse of discretion to fail to specify a plan by which unsupervised visitation could have been achieved and to order supervised visitation until the father reasonably believed that supervision was no longer necessary.

       Visitation provisions of subsection (a) of this section are facially constitutional because visitation rights can be sought only in a pending child custody case; although subsection (a) permits a court to provide for visitation “by a grandparent or other person” based on the best interests of a child, the phrase “by a grandparent or other person” is limited to third parties who have a significant connection to the child.

       The purpose of this section is to set standards for the adjudication of custody disputes between parents in a nondivorce setting. It does not imply that the superior court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate custody disputes between a parent and a nonparent. Such disputes are civil matters over which the superior court has undoubted subject matter jurisdiction. Buness v. Gillen, 781 P.2d 985 (Alaska 1989), overruled in part, Evans v.

       In child custody proceedings, the best interests of the child is the paramount consideration, and the father’s argument that the superior court’s decision was “prejudicial” to him did not provide sufficient grounds for reversing the superior court’s order awarding custody to the mother.

       Court did not abuse its discretion by splitting the costs of supervised visitation between the mother and father when it granted the mother’s motion to have limited supervised visits with the parties’ minor children in a therapeutic setting for a six-month period.

      <p>
       Superior court did not abuse its discretion following a domestic violence hearing by restricting a mother to supervised visitation because the mother had notice of the domestic violence hearing, attended the hearing with counsel, and had the opportunity to testify and present other evidence if she wished. The court acted well within its statutory authority when, as a result of the findings of custodial interference by the mother made at the hearing, the court modified custody and imposed conditions on her visitation.

       Because the grandmother was not allowed to intervene, she was never a party to the custody proceedings, meaning that she did not formally request the court to grant visitation rights during the pendency of the custody proceedings; she was therefore eligible to institute a separate action seeking visitation.

       In the context of a grandmother's petition for visitation, a superior court did not clearly err in finding that the mother and father were fit parents where there was no evidence that two incidents that occurred more than two years prior harmed the children, one incident occurred when the parents' marriage was at a low point and exacerbated by the grandmother's presence, and there was no history of domestic violence between the parents.

       Grandmother failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the parents' preference to limit contact with the grandmother until the relationship between the parents and the grandmother healed was clearly contrary to the children's best interests as she presented no evidence on the issue, but instead relied on the inference of detriment common to all similar relationships disrupted by geographical separation.

       Dismissal of grandparent’s visitation petition was appropriate because the trial court’s findings that the parents were fit, that the parents’ visitation restrictions were not unreasonable, and that there was no history of unreasonable visitation denial by the parents precluded the possibility that a constitutional visitation order could be entered.

       was not an abuse of discretion where the court left grandparent visitation to the child’s discretion, finding that the child had facilitated such visitations in the past and would continue to do so in the future, and if the child did not follow through with these intentions, the grandparents could then petition the court for visitation rights due to a “change in circumstances” in accordance with paragraph (b)(2).

       Trial court properly denied a grandmother’s petition for visitation because she had made no attempt to reunify with her daughter and the daughter’s family without court involvement, had such limited interaction with the children that she did not clearly establish ongoing personal contact, and did not show that it was in the children’s best interests to have court-ordered visitation with her.

         Custody change standard is best interests of the child, changed circumstances alone do not justify a change of custody. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the requested change in custody was not in the child’s best interests, it was unnecessary to determine whether there was a substantial change in circumstances, as the dispositive issue was best interests, not the alleged change in circumstances. Matthew P. v. Gail S., 354 P.3d 1044 (Alaska 2015).
       </p>

        <b>
         Applicability of changed circumstances doctrine. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The changed circumstances doctrine applies to modifications of stipulated child custody arrangements in effect for a significant period of time. S.N.E. v. R.L.B., 699 P.2d 875 (Alaska 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Court, on own motion, can find change of circumstance

        <b>
         Creation of visitation schedule. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Where parties did not have a schedule, setting a schedule was not a modification, and had the schedule conformed to the parties’ plan for a fifty-fifty split in custody, it would not have required a showing of changed circumstances; because the parents were unable to agree on the schedule, the court had the authority to establish a specific schedule, but it was an abuse of discretion to adopt a sixty-forty custody schedule where the parties continued to agree that fifty-fifty custody was in the child’s best interests. Havel v. Havel, 216 P.3d 1148 (Alaska 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         For modification of custody to be justified, two circumstances must correspond:
        </b>
        (1) the noncustodial parent must bear the burden in the modification proceeding of establishing that a change in circumstances has occurred, and (2) the modification must be in the best interests of the child. Nichols v. Mandelin, 790 P.2d 1367 (Alaska 1990).
       </p>

        <b>
         Evidence required for modification of visitation not sufficient to modify custody. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Modification of a visitation schedule was not erroneous because the evidence supported modification of the time-sharing schedule set out in the parties’ agreement, but was not sufficient to support modification of custody. Martin v. Martin, 303 P.3d 421 (Alaska 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Modification motion not barred by finality principle. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Finality principle did not bar a mother from basing a custody modification motion on 1999 and 2004 domestic violence incidents, any new claims of domestic violence occurring between 2005 and 2007, or claims of domestic violence occurring after a December 2007 hearing because none of the undisputed or alleged incidents were addressed by the trial court in its custody determinations. McAlpine v. Pacarro, 262 P.3d 622 (Alaska 2011).

        <b>
         Degree of change required. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The change of circumstances required to modify visitation is not as great as that required for a change in custody. Carter v. Brodrick, 816 P.2d 202 (Alaska 1991); Morino v. Swayman, 970 P.2d 426 (Alaska 1999).

         Court order requiring change in procedure after two years. —

       </p>
       <p>
        Court-ordered two-year adjustment period in which one parent would have primary custody and other parent would have liberal visitation rights, with parents to share custody equally on an alternating week basis after two years, was not automatic modification of custody not based on statutorily mandated factors for a change in custody. Deininger v. Deininger, 835 P.2d 449 (Alaska 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Formalization of custodial or visitation arrangements. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Informal or de facto modifications of custodial or visitation arrangements should be formalized, since child support amounts and the number of visitation days allotted to the non-custodial parent are interdependent under Alaska Civ. R. 90.3(a) and (b). Morino v. Swayman, 970 P.2d 426 (Alaska 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Actions by a custodial parent that substantially interfere with the noncustodial parent’s visitation rights are sufficient to constitute a change in circumstances, which may justify and require a modification of the visitation order if such modification is in the best interest of the child. Hermosillo v. Hermosillo, 797 P.2d 1206 (Alaska 1990).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was evidence of a deteriorating relationship between the custodial mother and her teenage son in the months preceding the hearing, and where the teenager moved to his father’s home and refused to live with his mother, these changes clearly constituted a substantial change in circumstances that justified a review of the existing custody arrangement, and the superior court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the father had satisfied his burden of demonstrating a substantial change in circumstances. Valentino v. Cote, 3 P.3d 337 (Alaska 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        The moving parent for a modification in custody must show changes that affect the child’s welfare to overcome the court’s deep reluctance to shuttle children back and forth between parents. Schuyler v. Briner, 13 P.3d 738 (Alaska 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        When mother filed a motion for supervised child visitation 17 months after she was arrested for child abuse, the superior court properly found that her deferred sentencing agreement constituted a material change in circumstances because it ended the no contact order imposed while her criminal case was pending. Thomas v. Thomas, — P.3d — (Alaska July 27, 2011), (memorandum opinion).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a child custody modification case, the superior court did not abuse its discretion in finding a material change of circumstances due to the mother’s arrests and conduct with her boyfriends that involved domestic violence and a gun. Heather W. v. Rudy R., 274 P.3d 478 (Alaska 2012).

       </p>
       <p>
        Father failed to carry the burden of proving a substantial change in circumstances, where, apart from the father’s attempt to gain sole custody, there was no evidence to support the superior court’s finding that the parties had become “unable to cooperate with each other to the extent necessary to make a joint custody arrangement work.” Garding v. Garding, 767 P.2d 183 (Alaska 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother, who sought modification of child custody, failed to show a substantial change in circumstances; her allegations that the child’s grades had declined and that he was experiencing other problems in his father’s custody were not offered until her reply to the father’s response to her motion, and the mother was not entitled to a hearing. King v. Carey, 143 P.3d 972 (Alaska 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where mother had physical custody of daughter during the school year and father was granted summer visitation, he proposed that the parties reverse their custody arrangement and try a three-week experiment arrangement; where mother refused to formalize a custody change and insisted that the child be returned to her, superior court erred by granting father’s motion for modification because there was no substantial change of circumstances as required by subsection (a). McLane v. Paul, 189 P.3d 1039 (Alaska 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court was not required to analyze the best interests of the children because the mother failed to demonstrate that there had been a substantial change in circumstances that would have justified modifying the trial court’s custody and visitation order. The father’s relocation was specifically contemplated by the parties’ agreement. Susan M. v. Paul H., 362 P.3d 460 (Alaska 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court, following an award of child custody to the grandparents, did not err in denying the mother's motion to modify custody, without an evidentiary hearing, because the mother did not show a substantial change of circumstances affecting the child's best interests, as the mother's mental health assessment, four months sobriety from marijuana use and commitment to abstain from such use during the mother's then pregnancy, and relationship with her fiancé did not constitute a substantial change that affected the child's best interests. Abby D. v. Sue Y., 378 P.3d 388 (Alaska 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denying a mother's motion to modify custody of a daughter was not error where the father's new work schedule and family arrangements did not demonstrate any material negative impact on the child, thus, no substantial change in circumstances had occurred, and enforcing a prior order requiring that the daughter and mother have two uninterrupted calls per week was more appropriate than a change in custody. Moore v. McGillis, 408 P.3d 1196 (Alaska 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father's motion to modify child custody based on a substantial change in circumstances was properly denied because the changes identified were the outgrowth of the superior court's decision to allow the mother to move to Germany with the children, and it had anticipated that there might be setbacks as the children adapted to German schooling; the father did not address the concern that he was able to exert undue influence on the children; there was no abuse of discretion in denying a change of custody when a parent did not address concerns about the children potentially having been coached and influenced, making it impossible to determine their true preferences; and the eldest child's age alone did not constitute a change in circumstances. Bennett v. Bennett, — P.3d — (Alaska Sept. 25, 2019) (memorandum decision).
       </p>
       <p>
        No substantial change in circumstances justifying a modification of custody was shown because (1) the parties did not agree to modification, (2) the children stated no such preference, (3) passage of time did not suffice, (4) the parties' inability to communicate was not a change, and (5) a change in a mother's child-care ability was not substantial.

         Parental preference. —

       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court erred when it failed to apply the biological parent preference and determined that the father bore the usual burden of a non-custodial parent moving to modify the existing custody arrangement; Interpreting the order as permanent and dispositive of the father's parental preference was an abuse of discretion, the parental preference therefore did not drop out, and the grandmother continued to have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the preference should be overcome.

       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court properly denied a divorced father’s request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the mother from leaving Alaska with their children; the father did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of his claim because Alaska law did not require a custodial parent to obtain permission from the non-custodial parent before moving out of state. The father still had the option of filing a motion to modify custody based on the change in circumstances because the superior court retained jurisdiction over the parties and their children despite the mother’s move.

       </p>
       <p>
        A mother's claim that there had been a substantial change in circumstances warranting a change in legal custody was denied. The evidence was sufficient to conclude that the parties' ability to communicate, though not ideal, was not unusual in the circumstances and was adequate to support continued joint decision-making.

       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily, hostility and dispute between the parents, in and of itself, will not be considered a substantial change of circumstances unless the adverse impact on the child is extreme. The effect of hostility between the parents, however, may combine with other significant changes in circumstance to amount, in the aggregate, to a substantial change sufficient to warrant change of custody. Long v. Long, 816 P.2d 145 (Alaska 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding of a complete breakdown in communication between the parties, making joint custody impracticable and injurious to the children’s overall well-being, was a sufficient change in circumstances to support modification of custody Riggs v. Coonradt, 335 P.3d 1103 (Alaska 2014).

         Inability to pay arrearage. —

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial judge was not required to articulate her consideration of the father’s arrearage where the uncontradicted evidence supported a finding that the father’s arrearage was the result of an inability to pay; the father’s testimony was sufficient to support a finding that the exception in subsection (b) was met. Peterson v. Swarthout, 214 P.3d 332 (Alaska 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court’s failure to consider the arrearage, or the failure to articulate consideration of it, in modifying a child custody order was not an abuse of discretion where the mother testified that the father was very aware that she was not going to be current on her child support based on what she earned, and that suggested that she was behind in her support payments because she could not afford to make them.

        Where father had physical custody of the couple’s two sons for nine months, and the mother for three, and the mother had been granted regularly scheduled phone contact by the court, occasional missed calls did not constitute a change of circumstances.

       <p>
        In addition to finding a substantial change in circumstances, under subsection (a) a court must also consider whether a modification of custody was in the best interests of the child; a court determining the best interests of a child by considering nine statutory factors and a judge considering the best interests of a child must consider the findings made at the original hearing.

        Where a mother and father were given shared physical custody of their son after a divorce, and the mother later filed a motion to modify custody prior to her move to another state, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding the mother primary physical custody, since the mother would not be working outside of the home and it was in the child’s best interests.

       <p>
        Granting a father’s motion to modify child custody was proper where the move out of state constituted a substantial change of circumstances and the court’s analysis of the best interest factors supported awarding the father custody of the children during the school year in Virginia.

        Because the supreme court could determine whether the superior court abused its discretion in weighing the best interests factors, the case was remanded for renewed consideration of the challenged factors along with the symmetrical analysis; the superior court's analysis of the child's needs and the parents' capability and desire to meet them did not support its conclusion that it was in the child's best interests to remain in Alaska.

        It was error to modify parties’ custody arrangement without holding a hearing or making factual findings; the superior court’s modification was not insignificant, and the parties’ original arrangement was not by court order, so the modification was an initial determination that required a hearing.

        The trial court is not required to hold a hearing whenever a parent moves for a change in visitation; thus, where no facts were disputed with respect to the child’s desire to see her father, and there were no factual issues that an evidentiary hearing would flesh out, a hearing was not required.

        Trial judge’s decision to deny the mother’s motion for modification without a hearing was not an abuse of discretion where the mother’s concerns did not demonstrate that any changes in circumstances between the May 2007 hearing and the mother’s motion to modify custody were significant enough to justify relitigating the issue of custody; the mother’s motion did not demonstrate sustained noncooperation since the time of the previous hearing sufficient to suggest that the issue of legal custody should be relitigated.

       <p>
        There was not a changed circumstance warranting a hearing on the modification of child custody because, as the superior court noted when it denied the father's first motion, completion of counseling was a condition for his visitation with his daughter and was not a changed circumstance justifying a change in custody; the father's allegations about the mother's mental health, even if proven, were not linked to any allegation that her mental health adversely affected their daughter's welfare; and the father's conclusory arguments about the current custody order's interference with the girl's exposure to Filipino language and culture were not sufficient, even if proven, to warrant a hearing.

      </p>
      <p>
       Because due process requires an evidentiary hearing on contested issues before the entry of statutory sanctions against a parent for violation of a custody and visitation agreement, trial court abused its discretion in awarding sanctions without holding an evidentiary hearing after the mother pointed out disputed issues of material facts raised by the parties’ affidavits and after the mother expressly requested a hearing.

       Upon denying a motion to modify custody, the superior court erred by failing to make explicit findings on the parties’ relative financial resources and by expanding the scope of the fee award without notice; thus, a remand was necessary. Collier v. Harris, 261 P.3d 397 (Alaska 2011).

       Alaska case law has thus far required explicit findings when making an award of attorney’s fees, and these findings are ordinarily necessary when the superior court denies a motion for attorney’s fees, so that the decision can be properly reviewed; as it could not be determined in this case whether the trial court actually considered the issues the father raised on appeal, the case was remanded.

       Trial court did not err when it concluded that the father had a just excuse for withholding the children from the mother based on the father’s concerns that the mother might again flee with the children and that the mother would grill the children about their honesty, damaging her relationship with them.

       Trial court abused its discretion in awarding sanctions under this section based upon a mother’s alleged violation of the parties’ visitation agreement; sanctions are appropriate for a wilful violation of a “court order,” but the parties’ out-of-court settlement agreement that was never submitted for court approval did not qualify as a court order.

       Trial court’s award of attorney’s fees in an action for enforcement of visitation rights was reversed and the case was remanded, where the award was based on the inappropriate “prevailing party” standard of Civil Rule 82, rather than on a determination that the father had “willfully and without just excuse” failed to permit visitation.

       based on a finding that there had not been a meeting of the minds due to a mistake about the biological mother’s relationship with the child after the adoption decree; the Supreme Court of Alaska held that a mere mistake about post-adoption visitation was not a ground to invalidate an adoption decree. However, the biological mother was entitled to visitation rights as contemplated by the parties; the superior court had the authority to enforce a visitation framework in the best interests of the child.

        Rights of parent-child relationship are natural, fundamental. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The correlative rights and duties inherent in the parent-child relationship are natural rights of such fundamental importance that it is generally held that parents should not be deprived of them “except for grave and weighty reasons.” Delgado v. Fawcett, 515 P.2d 710 (Alaska 1973).

       <b>
        Father’s consent required. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly denied the adoptive parents’ petition to adopt a child because the father’s consent was required before they could adopt the child. The Indian Child Welfare Act did not preempt the state laws, the father legitimated the child, the father’s indigence existed despite at least some efforts to find work and improve his prospects through education, the adoptive parents did not prove that he lacked justifiable cause for his failure to pay child support, and there was no final order on the visitation issue that would support an appeal. Ebert v. Bruce L., 340 P.3d 1048 (Alaska 2014).
      </p>

       <b>
        Right of parent not absolute. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of a parent with respect to his child is not an absolute, paramount, proprietary right or interest in, or to custody of the child. Hammer v. Hammer, 16 Alaska 203 (D. Alaska 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature did not make the right of parental consent absolute and unqualified. Delgado v. Fawcett, 515 P.2d 710 (Alaska 1973).

      <p>
       <b>
        Strict construction. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutes relating to adoption, being in derogation of the common law, must be strictly construed. Hammer v. Hammer, 16 Alaska 203 (D. Alaska 1956).

       <b>
        Duty of state as “parens patria”. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature may interpose between the parent and the child such regulations as it may deem best for the welfare of either by reason of the duty of the state as “parens patria” to guard the interests of such children, the welfare of which is always the paramount consideration. Hammer v. Hammer, 16 Alaska 203 (D. Alaska 1956).

       <b>
        Reason for consent provisions. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In an adoption proceeding, where an absolute severance of the parent-child relationship is sought, the consent provisions are designed to protect the natural rights of a parent to the custody, society, comfort, and services of the child. Delgado v. Fawcett, 515 P.2d 710 (Alaska 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        No unconditional agreement to adopt. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it was undisputed that the adoptive mother never unconditionally agreed that the petitioner father could adopt the child, the petitioner father’s petition for adoption was properly denied; the petitioner father understood that adopting the child was contingent on the petitioner father’s relationship with the adoptive mother improving, which did not happen. Osterkamp v. Stiles, 235 P.3d 193 (Alaska 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Natural parents have no affirmative right to decide adoptive parents. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Order terminating parents’ rights was upheld where the parents’ designation of a relative as a caregiver for the child did not remedy the risk of harm that they posed to the child. The parents had no affirmative right under this section to decide who would adopt the child. Debbie G. v. Dep't of Health &amp; Social Servs., 132 P.3d 1168 (Alaska 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Custody involves a variety of parental rights and duties,
       </b>
       which vary according to the circumstances of the relationship of the child to the parent. Delgado v. Fawcett, 515 P.2d 710 (Alaska 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Custody” pertains not only to the parental control of the child, but is inseparably linked to the parent’s rights of access and companionship with his offspring. Delgado v. Fawcett, 515 P.2d 710 (Alaska 1973).

        Adoption resolution of Native American village. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An adoption resolution of a Native American village was not entitled to comity or full faith and credit in the courts because it was obtained in violation of the natural father’s right to consent. Evans v. Native Village of Selawik IRA Council, 65 P.3d 58 (Alaska 2003).

       and subsection (a) of this section, an acknowledgment of paternity can be filed at any time before the entry of a decree of adoption. In re Adoption of H., 597 P.2d 513 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The filing of an adoption petition does not preclude the biological father from thereafter filing a written acknowledgment of his paternity of the subject child, thereby legitimizing him. In re Adoption of H., 597 P.2d 513 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Interpretation of the relevant statutes precludes additional consideration of the best interests of the child in determining whether a father may legitimate the adoptee during the pendency of an adoption proceeding and so foreclose adoption absent his consent.

       It was error for the trial court to equitably estop a mother from withholding consent to her child’s adoption by the man she had represented was the child’s father; since the mother had never represented that she would consent to that person’s adopting the child, the adoption decree was void and should have been set aside.

       </p>
       <p>
        Biological mother’s petition to adopt her son was denied because she already had a legal parent-child relationship. The child’s paternity was known, and the biological father did not consent to the termination of his parental rights. In re Adoption of Xavier K., 268 P.3d 274 (Alaska 2012), overruled in part, Angelica C. v. Jonathan C., 459 P.3d 1148 (Alaska 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court properly denied the adoptive parents’ petition to adopt a child because the father’s consent was required before they could adopt the child. The Indian Child Welfare Act did not preempt the state laws, the father legitimated the child, the father’s indigence existed despite at least some efforts to find work and improve his prospects through education, the adoptive parents did not prove that he lacked justifiable cause for his failure to pay child support, and there was no final order on the visitation issue that would support an appeal.

         Willfulness element essential to denial of right to consent. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent the element of willfulness, a parent does not lose the right to consent to adoption under this section. The underlying agreement between the natural mother and the potential adoptive parents demonstrated neither party anticipated the natural mother would support the child given the contemplated adoption, thus negating any element of willfulness on the mother’s part, which demonstrated that her failure to support the child was not without justifiable cause. The superior court did not err in its determination that, absent the mother’s consent to the petition for adoption, the petition should be dismissed. J.F. v. C.M.H. (In re J.M.F.), 881 P.2d 1116 (Alaska 1994).

       <p>
        The supreme court rejected the contention that the required consent of the child’s father may be dispensed with if it is in the best interest of the child to do so. In re Adoption of H., 597 P.2d 513 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The child’s best interests are not relevant to a determination of whether a natural parent’s consent can be dispensed with by the court. D.L.J. v. W.D.R., 635 P.2d 834 (Alaska 1981).

       <p>
        Parental conduct which causes loss of a parent’s right to consent to adoption must be wilful. R.N.T. v. J.R.G., 666 P.2d 1036 (Alaska 1983), overruled, In re J.J.J., 718 P.2d 948 (Alaska 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father's consent to an adoption was excused where the potential adoptive parents' testimony provided clear and convincing evidence that he had not paid child support for a period of one year, and his testimony, bank statements, and disparaging comments about the adoptive parents showed that the failure to pay was willful. Bruce L. v. Ebert, — P.3d — (Alaska July 25, 2018) (memorandum decision).

       </p>
       <p>
        “Custody” pertains not only to the parental control of the child, but is inseparably linked to the parent’s rights of access and companionship with his offspring. Delgado v. Fawcett, 515 P.2d 710 (Alaska 1973).

       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a divorce decree awards custody to one parent, and “visitation rights” to the other may in no way reflect upon the noncustodial parent’s fitness. Delgado v. Fawcett, 515 P.2d 710 (Alaska 1973).

       </p>
       <p>
        If it is shown that, since the entry of judgment circumstances have changed so as to require a modification of the decree in the best interests of the children, a court may terminate parental rights of visitation. Delgado v. Fawcett, 515 P.2d 710 (Alaska 1973).

         In order for a noncustodial parent to block a stepparent adoption,

        he or she must have maintained meaningful contact with a child, and must have provided regular payments of child support, unless prevented from doing so by circumstances beyond the noncustodial parent’s control; circumstances resulting from the noncustodial parent’s own conduct cannot excuse such a parent’s significant failure to provide support or maintain meaningful communication.

        The adoptive parent has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the natural parent failed significantly to communicate with or to provide support for the child. D.L.J. v. W.D.R., 635 P.2d 834 (Alaska 1981); R.N.T. v. J.R.G., 666 P.2d 1036 (Alaska 1983), overruled, In re J.J.J., 718 P.2d 948 (Alaska 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because only the natural parent can explain why he or she failed to communicate with or to provide support for the child, fairness requires that he or she then bear the burden of coming forward with evidence of a justifiable cause for such omissions before justification becomes an issue. Thereafter, the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the natural parent’s omissions were not justified rests with the adoptive parent. D.L.J. v. W.D.R., 635 P.2d 834 (Alaska 1981).

       <p>
        An adoption proceeding operates to replace a parent, while a child-in-need-of-aid proceeding operates to emancipate a child from an offending parent’s legal bonds. The different purposes of the two statutory mechanisms justify the use of different standards. A parent’s conduct, though not so dangerous as to warrant placement of the child with the state, may nonetheless justify disregarding the parents’ refusal to consent to adoption. Addison v.

        Evidence of subjective intent may be admitted to show what the “cause” for a parent’s course of action was, but whether the cause was justifiable must turn on the court’s determination of what grounds are objectively acceptable. D.L.J. v. W.D.R., 635 P.2d 834 (Alaska 1981).

        Even though the custodial parent has the right to direct the child’s activities and to make decisions regarding the care of the child that are often beyond the absent parent’s control, this does not excuse the absent parent’s obligations to provide support for and meaningful contact with his or her child.

        Imprisonment does not necessarily preclude a parent from communicating with his children but, where it does, the failure to communicate is properly considered non-wilful and thus justifiable cause.

        Where father absconded from Alabama with year-old son, whose whereabouts were unknown to mother (who remained in Alabama) for two years until father’s sister informed mother of child’s presence but did not offer to return child, mother’s year-long failure to communicate with child after she learned his presence in Alaska was justified, since written or telephonic communications would not have been “meaningful” under the circumstances and since mother was financially unable during that time to travel to Alaska or retain counsel therein to enforce an existing Alabama custody order.

        Superior court’s dismissal of a petition for adoption was affirmed where there was an adequate evidentiary basis for the superior court’s findings relating to the issue of the natural father’s justification for failing to communicate with his child: (1) That the natural father’s failure to communicate was justified since the child was too young (between two and three years of age) to talk on the telephone or understand gifts or letters from her father; (2) that the natural mother’s postponement of certain requested visitations and the natural father’s emotional difficulty in visiting with the new family justified his failure to communicate with the child; and (3) that the new family’s absence from Alaska for three months during the critical year period made it less reasonable for the natural father to exercise his visitation right.

         B.Abandonment
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         The test for abandonment
        </b>
        is whether there is “conduct on the part of the parent which implies a conscious disregard of the obligations owed by a parent to the child, leading to the destruction of the parent-child relationship.” In re Adoption of N., 525 P.2d 520 (Alaska 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Such test focuses on two questions
        </b>
        — has the parent’s conduct evidenced a disregard for his parental obligations, and has that disregard led to the destruction of the parent-child relationship? In re Adoption of N., 525 P.2d 520 (Alaska 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        A finding of abandonment involves a two-pronged inquiry: There must first be a finding of conduct evidencing a conscious disregard of parental obligations; secondly, the court must find that such disregard has led to the destruction of the parent-child relationship. Adoption of C., 528 P.2d 788 (Alaska 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The two elements of the test are interdependent;
        </b>
        both must be established if there is to be legal abandonment. Adoption of C., 528 P.2d 788 (Alaska 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Absent a sufficient finding of the requisite conduct,
        </b>
        even a consideration of the best interests of the child and a breakdown of the parent-child relationship would be insufficient to support a finding of legal abandonment. Adoption of C., 528 P.2d 788 (Alaska 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere fact that there is evidence of the relationship’s destruction is of no consequence if it cannot be established that there was parental conduct which caused it. Adoption of C., 528 P.2d 788 (Alaska 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The best interests of the child are relevant to the latter question in the test for abandonment,
        </b>
        because it is indicative of a breakdown of the parent-child relationship if the child’s best interests are promoted by legal severance of the relation. In re Adoption of N., 525 P.2d 520 (Alaska 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         But they may not always be directly relevant to the question of the parent’s disregard of his obligations.
        </b>
        This part of the test can only be satisfied by proof that the parent’s conduct evidences a conscious disregard of his obligations. In re Adoption of N., 525 P.2d 520 (Alaska 1974); Adoption of C., 528 P.2d 788 (Alaska 1974).

        The best interests of the child are a valid factor in deciding an “abandonment” allegation.
        However, an abandonment finding cannot be predicated solely on the best interests of the child. In re Adoption of N., 525 P.2d 520 (Alaska 1974); Adoption of C., 528 P.2d 788 (Alaska 1974).

         Master’s finding. —

        In a case in which a child’s father appealed a superior court’s decision that his consent was not required for the child’s adoption, the master’s finding that the father abandoned the child was amply supported by the record. In re Adoption of S.F., 340 P.3d 1045 (Alaska 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence relating solely to the question of what disposition may be in the child’s best interests — evidence pertinent primarily to an inquiry into the present vitality, strength and stability of the parent-child relationship — is ultimately inconsequential in the absence of proof of the requisite prior conduct.

        Determining what is in child’s best interest. —

      </p>
      <p>
       When a natural parent consents to his or her child’s adoption and later seeks to withdraw such consent, no parental preference is to be applied in determining what is in the child’s best interest. S.O. v. W.S., 643 P.2d 997 (Alaska 1982), overruled in part, Rosen v. State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy, 689 P.2d 478 (Alaska 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1901-1963, the test of best interests of the child is serious emotional or physical harm to the child, while the analysis required by state law when a parent who has consented to an adoption seeks to regain custody of his or her child upon termination of the adoptive relationship, addresses only the best interests of the child. A.B.M. v. M.H., 651 P.2d 1170 (Alaska 1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 914, 103 S. Ct. 1893, 77 L. Ed. 2d 283 (U.S. 1983).

       Superior court properly determined that withdrawal of the father's consent to adoption by his sister, the children's aunt, would not be in the children's best interests and denied the father permission to withdraw his consent because the father wanted custody as it was in his best interests, rather than the children's; the children's psychological welfare, schoolwork, and behavior had improved since living with their aunt; the children were bonded with their aunt and had built a good relationship with her; and the father's claims of having addressed his personal and parenting problems were undermined by his previous failure to maintain such behavior after having his children returned to him.

       The natural mother is entitled to a hearing to determine whether withdrawal of her consent is in the best interest of the child. B.J.B.A. v. M.J.B., 620 P.2d 652 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a notice of withdrawal was filed, the court’s failure to afford the natural mother a hearing was error. B.J.B.A. v. M.J.B., 620 P.2d 652 (Alaska 1980).

       In an adoption case, the relevant factors are the consent of the parents and the best interests of the child. Adoption of L.E.K.M., 70 P.3d 1097 (Alaska 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Biological mother’s petition to adopt her son was properly denied. It was not in the child’s best interests to grant the adoption petition, in part because terminating the non-consenting father’s parental rights without replacing him with a legally obligated adult contravened the purpose of adoption. In re Adoption of Xavier K., 268 P.3d 274 (Alaska 2012), overruled in part, Angelica C. v. Jonathan C., 459 P.3d 1148 (Alaska 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court's determination that adoption was against the child's best interest was supported by a finding that the child's emotional, mental, and social needs would be best served by developing a relationship with the father, who was capable of meeting and willing to meeting those needs, and by the counselor's belief that it was in the child's best interest for her to work through her issues with the father.

       Superior court did not err when it granted custody of a child to her caregivers rather than allowing her grandparents to adopt her, where the issue was not merely primary caregiving but whether removing the child from the primary custody of the people with whom she had spent 21 of her 24 months would be unnecessarily traumatic for her, especially since she had already lost one set of parents; the superior court carefully questioned in voir dire each expert who testified on child psychology about the possible effects on the child of being separated from the caregivers and overruled objections to such questions when asked.

       Superior court took the kinship circle argument seriously, and cited its importance in granting custody of an orphan to the child’s daycare providers instead of granting adoption to the child’s paternal grandparents, where the evidence showed that the grandparents knew little about the child’s murdered mother’s family whereas the daycare provider had grown up with the mother as children, still kept in contact with her family, and had been close to the mother’s parents when they were alive.

       When the parties bought a home together and became foster parents of a one-week-old child, the father allowed the mother alone to adopt the child when he was sixteen months old; in the child custody dispute that arose when the mother left, the father was not allowed to use his time as a foster parent to prove that he was a psychological parent, because the final adoption decree had the effect of making the adopted child a stranger to the former relatives under this section.

       California resident’s petition to vacate an Alaska adoption decree, alleging violation of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, was barred by the one-year limitation of this section, and was not governed by California’s three-year limitation, where the decree was issued by an Alaska court, the adoptive child and her family lived in Alaska, and the petitioner had consented to the adoption in an Alaska court. In re Adoption of T.N.F., 781 P.2d 973 (Alaska 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1030, 110 S. Ct. 1480, 108 L. Ed. 2d 616 (U.S. 1990).

       Where the biological mother petitioned to set aside an adoption decree before the one-year period expired, this section did not apply. The biological mother’s mere mistake about post-adoption visitation was not a basis to invalidate the adoption decree. In re Adoption of S.K.L.H., 204 P.3d 320 (Alaska 2009).

       Court properly dismissed a father’s petition to set aside an adoption under the Indian Child Welfare Act because Alaska’s one-year statute of limitations applied; it provided an appropriate balance between the important federal rights of Indian tribes and families and the best interests of adopted children; where the trial court issued the adoption decree on September 6, 2002, and the father petitioned on October 21, 2004, to invalidate the adoption, the petition was time-barred.

The request made under this subsection may only be considered by the court after providing at least 20 days’ notice by certified mail to the last known address of the person who has voluntarily relinquished parental rights to the child. The notice under this subsection must describe the request and explain that the recipient of the notice may submit a written statement under penalty of perjury to the court that the recipient either agrees with or opposes the request. The notice must also include the deadline for submitting the statement and the mailing address of the court. The court may decline to incorporate a retained privilege if the person who retained the privilege agrees with the request or if the court finds that it is in the child’s best interest.

       Where a father voluntarily relinquished his parental rights and subsequently attempted to withdraw his relinquishment, the superior court did not abuse its discretion in denying him a hearing as provided for in Rita T. v. State, 623 P.2d 344 (Alaska 1981) because the record demonstrated that the father did not have the ability to properly care for the special needs of his children. Alden H. v.

        Termination of parental rights. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The language in subsection (a) stating that termination of parental rights can occur “before an adoption proceeding” must be read in conjunction with the “relinquishment” language of subsection (b), which does not contemplate involuntary termination actions, but instead refers to cases in which parents choose to give up their parental rights. S.J. v. L.T., 727 P.2d 789 (Alaska 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent statutory authorization, there can be no termination of parental rights and obligations; therefore, 1986 termination order was erroneously entered since it was not entered in a statutorily authorized adoption proceeding or a child-in-need-of-aid proceeding. Perry v. Newkirk, 871 P.2d 1150 (Alaska 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to deny a mother's petition to terminate the parental rights of a father whose sexual assault of the mother resulted in the child's birth for lack of statutory authority because a termination action independent of adoption or Child In Need of Aid procedures was statutorily authorized, and later statutory amendments merely clarified that authority.

       One-year residency requirement of former AS 09.55.140, prior to subsequent amendment, was unconstitutional. State v. Adams, 522 P.2d 1125 (Alaska 1974).

       Where domicile is a statutory jurisdictional prerequisite it is quite correct to say that jurisdiction for divorce is founded on this concept.

       The court is not justified in decreeing a divorce on ground of cruelty unless the evidence shows, first, that the defendant’s treatment of the plaintiff was cruel and inhuman; and, second, that it was “calculated to impair his health or endanger his life.” Cowden v.

       If either party to a marriage contract should persistently indulge in false and vile accusations of the other to such an extent that the one so accused suffered an impairment of health, it would seem that the one thus aggrieved should not be required to prove that the offender intended such a result.
       One is ordinarily presumed to intend the natural consequences of his own wrongful acts.
       If the wrongful acts produce an evil result, it is too subtle a distinction for the wrongdoers to hide behind a self-serving declaration that it was not intended, or to assign some other excuse. Day v. Day, 5 Alaska 584 (D. Alaska 1916).

        While a divorce suit was pending, an order of the court directing the husband to pay the wife a specified sum for the purpose of enabling her to satisfy the claims of physicians for their professional services in attending the couple’s child was justified by the second subdivision of this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        Court's decision to award $5,000 a month in interim spousal support and not to credit the ex-husband for alleged overpayments of support was not an abuse of discretion because the court took into account the parties' needs and ability to pay, crafted its award to preserve - and ultimately sell - the marital home, and provided for the parties' reasonable and necessary living expenses during the pendency of the divorce; the ex-wife's $4,000 maintenance number included work needed to make the marital house marketable, utility costs, and support for her while working to maintain the property; and the husband acknowledged that making improvements to the house would cost more than merely maintaining the condition of the property.

         Factors to consider in awarding interim spousal maintenance. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        An award of interim maintenance provides for reasonable and necessary living expenses while divorce litigation is pending and insures that neither spouse is disadvantaged in presenting claims. The primary factors to be considered in awarding interim spousal maintenance are the relative economic circumstances and needs of the parties, and the ability to pay the maintenance. Johnson v. Johnson, 836 P.2d 930 (Alaska 1992).

        Because the trial court derived its authority to enter its interim order of spousal support under paragraph (a)(2), and given the inherently provisional nature of interim orders and the fact that subsection (a) does not prohibit modification, the discretionary regime set up by this statutory system provides the trial court with the discretion to modify interim spousal support orders.

       <p>
        Although the trial court has the authority to compel the sale of a divorcing couple’s property, this authority should be used sparingly; where no pressing reason exists to mandate a sale, court should rescind the transaction, and all parties, including the buyers, should be returned to their original positions.

       <p>
        Trial court’s order requiring the sale of the marital home prior to the final property decision was not supported by adequate findings; because the trial court made no findings and did not set out the calculations that led it to conclude that an interim sale was necessary, the Alaska Supreme Court could only guess as to why the court concluded that the pre-judgment sale of the residence would benefit the parties; and without the benefit of such findings the supreme court could not determine whether the exceptional circumstances required were present.

        It was not error to grant a mother's motion for the pre-trial sale of a marital home because (1) the father was collaterally estopped from denying the father's conviction for indecent exposure to the parties' child, (2) no party lived in the home, and (3) there was no evidence that the mother would sell the home for an unreasonably low price.

       </p>
       <p>
        The general rule with regard to fees in a divorce case is that the court should consider the economic situation and earning power of each party: If the parties are in comparable economic situations, they should bear their own costs and fees and, generally, a court will award costs and fees only to the economically disadvantaged divorce litigant.

       <p>
        In litigation concerning child custody and support, award of attorney fees to the child’s mother under this section was proper, even though the mother and father were never married, because it was a “divorce-like” action and the award ensured that the parties had the means to litigate on a fairly equal plane, given the vast financial disparity between the parties, as well as the reasonableness of the requested fees.

        Awarding a wife full costs and attorney fees in a divorce action was an abuse of discretion because the court did not identify the nature and amount of the increased litigation costs the husband’s vexatious behavior caused.

        When the father filed a complaint to establish custody over a foster child that the mother adopted, the superior court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered him to pay the mother interim attorney’s fees even though the parties were not legally married. The court reduced its original award of interim fees from $10,000 to $5,000, finding the award justified because the father had a greater income and occupied the home — the parties’ largest and only significant equity — throughout the action.

         Effect of one party’s misconduct on award. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        One party’s misconduct does not authorize the court to disregard the relative economic situations and earning powers of the parties.
        In making an increased fee award, the court must first determine what fee award would be appropriate under the general rule, and only then increase the award to account for a party’s misconduct.
        Failure to follow this two-step process constitutes an abuse of discretion. Kowalski v. Kowalski, 806 P.2d 1368 (Alaska 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court must make explicit findings of bad faith or vexatious conduct and clearly explain its reasons for deviating from the general rule. When the court finds that one spouse’s misconduct has unnecessarily increased the other spouse’s costs, the court must identify the nature and amount of these increased costs. Kowalski v. Kowalski, 806 P.2d 1368 (Alaska 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere evasiveness in responding, contentiousness over difficult issues, or delay in completing testimony do not, in themselves, constitute bad faith or vexatious conduct.
        These are by-products of the adversarial system itself. Conduct justifying an increased award must be such that the parties are prevented from litigating the action on an equal plane. Kowalski v. Kowalski, 806 P.2d 1368 (Alaska 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the court concluded that, based on the parties’ relative economic situations and earning powers, the parties should each bear their own attorney’s fees, but further found that the husband’s vexatious conduct caused a $125,000 increase in fees, it followed the proper standard in awarding that amount in favor of the wife. Wright v. Wright, 904 P.2d 403 (Alaska 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the parties did not have comparable economic situations, and the husband’s financial situation was more secure than the wife’s, it was not an abuse of discretion to award substantial attorney’s fees to the wife and, even though the wife had engaged in vexatious litigation conduct, her acts did not require complete denial of attorney’s fees. Beard v. Beard, 947 P.2d 831 (Alaska 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court’s findings that its order dividing property compensated for the disparity in the parties’ earning capacity and left them with comparable ability to litigate their divorce action, that both parties needlessly increased litigation costs and were completely uncooperative throughout the action, and that neither party had clean hands was sufficient to support its decision denying the wife’s request for attorney’s fees.

        Wife was properly awarded legal fees based on the husband’s conduct during divorce proceedings, where the husband engaged in passive-aggressive behavior, which included incidents of domestic violence. Rodvik v. Rodvik, 151 P.3d 338 (Alaska 2006).

       <p>
        Assuming that husband possessed greater financial resources and greater earning capabilities, the wife’s resources and capabilities were sufficient that a court could reasonably expect her to pay her own attorney’s fees; the Alaska supreme court affirmed the trial court’s order requiring the wife to do so where the wife had training in landscape architecture and experience in drafting and there was testimony that those skills could earn her $18,000—$20,000 a year.

        In a dissolution of marriage case, the court did not err in its award of attorney’s fees where the wife sold a marital asset, receiving $14,500 in cash plus a replacement car worth $2,495 to pay attorney’s fees, and she did not inform the husband of the sale, nor did she split the proceeds with him. Because the trial court found that the sale violated the standing order, it attributed the difference between the fair market value and the actual proceeds from the sale to the wife. Schmitz v.

        When modifying a divorce decree, a trial court did not err in awarding attorney fees to the wife because the husband’s delay in paying the wife for her share of the equity in the marital home unnecessarily increased her attorney fees. Worland v. Worland, 240 P.3d 825 (Alaska 2010).

        This section in specifying that the “religious needs” of the child may be considered in awarding custody, is not unconstitutional on its face. Bonjour v. Bonjour, 592 P.2d 1233 (Alaska 1979).

       </p>
       <p>
        District court should not have ceded its jurisdiction to Texas based on a finding that evidence about the children's current status was located there; trial court minimized the importance of protecting the children from the father's alleged domestic violence and the evidence required to resolve domestic violence and Indian Child Welfare Act issues. Inter alia, Alaska law has a presumption against awarding custody to a parent who was the perpetrator of domestic violence, and evidence relating to social and cultural standards, as well as testimony from a qualified expert, was located in Alaska.

       <p>
        Superior court did not abuse its discretion in finding that an alternating week custody schedule was not in the best interests of the children because it considered the pertinent factors; even though the superior court did not cite the statute, its oral findings demonstrated that it considered several of the statutory best interest factors, and its made clear that it considered how well the children were doing in the current custody arrangement. Trout v. Trout, — P.3d — (Alaska June 27, 2018) (memorandum decision).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court did not err in rejecting a mother's proposed week on/week off schedule would not be in the children's best interests because the children were doing well after a difficult adjustment to the divorce; the children's teachers all testified that the children were doing well, and the maternal grandmother thought it best for the children to remain primarily with the father. Trout v. Trout, — P.3d — (Alaska June 27, 2018) (memorandum decision).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court did not abuse its discretion in prioritizing its finding that it would not be in the best interests of the children to move to a week on/week off schedule over accommodating the cost structure of military child care because the new custody schedule extended the mother's weekend visits and provided that those visits would occur on weeks during which she had Fridays off, suggesting that the mother would not need to purchase child care for these weekend visits. Trout v. Trout, — P.3d — (Alaska June 27, 2018) (memorandum decision).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which the superior court increased the amount of a father's visitation but left primary physical custody with the mother, as well as the right to make final decisions if the parents could not agree on issues of legal custody, the Supreme Court concluded that the superior court did not clearly err in its findings of fact or abuse its discretion in weighing the best interests factors. The father did not persuade the Supreme Court that the superior court overlooked any relevant evidence in its consideration of the stability and continuity factor.

       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court did not err in modifying custody and the mother's visitation, in requiring her to demonstrate a long-term commitment to sobriety before she could regain shared physical custody of her children, and in concluding that an award of primary physical custody to the father was in the children's best interests because, while the court faulted both parents for their failure to prioritize their children, the mother had more work to do in establishing and maintaining her sobriety before she would be able to meet the children's needs; and the mother's history of alcohol abuse was directly affecting the emotional well-being of the children.

         Factors considered. —

       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court’s determination of the daughter’s best interests included a discussion of each of the factors specified in subsection (c) and, given the superior court’s previous assessment and the custody investigator’s conclusion that the daughter had the capacity to express a preference, it was not error for the court to consider the daughter’s preference; reliance on the custody investigator’s findings was not erroneous, and in light of the parents’ inability to communicate or to act appropriately with one another and with professionals involved in the daughter’s care, awarding sole legal custody to the father was not error. Cusack v. Cusack, 202 P.3d 1156 (Alaska 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court erred when it delegated to a mother the authority to require the father to attend an intervention program for batterers as a prerequisite for unsupervised visits; a decision to impose a condition must be made by the court. Misyura v. Misyura, 242 P.3d 1037 (Alaska 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a father contended that the superior court failed to consider the mother’s unannounced move to Florida with the child as evidence of the mother’s unwillingness to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the father and the child under AS

        , the superior court did consider this factor, and in fact identified it as one of the most relevant factors in the case. Green v. Parks, 338 P.3d 312 (Alaska 2014).

         Substance abuse. —

       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court's consideration of a father's substance abuse did not constitute an abuse of discretion because while the evidence of the father's substance abuse had no bearing on the best interests factor in subsection (c)(8), the superior court committed no error by considering his methamphetamine use as part of its best interests analysis under subsection (c)(9). Lewis G. v. Cassie Y., 426 P.3d 1136 (Alaska 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Only evidence supporting that there was substance abuse by the father was the mother's own allegations; the superior court did not clearly err in finding no substantiated evidence of substance abuse. Mengisteab v. Oates, 425 P.3d 80 (Alaska 2018).

        Where the court determined that the parties’ shared custody schedule was unworkable during the school year after the mother’s move, the custody modification order was supported by the evidence because the mother’s move was a substantial change in circumstances and modifying custody was in the children’s best interests under

        . The court properly focused its best interests analysis primarily on the needs of the children, because the mother was the primary caretaker of the children, she had a more stable household, the father limited his communication when he got a new girlfriend, and he had stopped paying child support.

       <p>
        Superior court did not clearly err in finding that the mother's move was primarily motivated by a desire to frustrate visitation; while she offered several legitimate reasons for her move, she repeatedly changed her plans about when she would leave Alaska, she did not provide contact information or adequate notice of her move to the court, and she did not provide either the court or the father with a forwarding address.

        State was not involved in this custody dispute case between the parents; by restricting the father to supervised visitation until he took steps necessary to overcome the statutory presumption against custody, the superior court merely followed the law based upon its findings about the father's conduct and he was not entitled to the procedures and protections afforded parents in child in need of aid cases.

         Welfare of children is given paramount consideration. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining the custody of children the trial court should be guided by the rule that the welfare and best interests of the children should be given paramount consideration. Rhodes v. Rhodes, 370 P.2d 902 (Alaska 1962); Ransier v. Ransier, 414 P.2d 956 (Alaska 1966); Glasgow v. Glasgow, 426 P.2d 617 (Alaska 1967); Bass v. Bass, 437 P.2d 324 (Alaska 1968); Sheridan v. Sheridan, 466 P.2d 821 (Alaska 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The paramount criterion of the welfare and best interests of the child overrides consideration of any factor of technical fault. Bass v. Bass, 437 P.2d 324 (Alaska 1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        There has been a steady course of legal development whereby the best interests of the child are to be the paramount consideration in custody cases, to the exclusion of other criteria, such as the doctrine that children of tender years will generally be awarded to the mother when other factors are fairly evenly balanced. King v. King, 477 P.2d 356 (Alaska 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The paramount consideration in any custody determination is what appears to be for the best interests of the child. Carle v. Carle, 503 P.2d 1050 (Alaska 1972); Nichols v. Nichols, 516 P.2d 732 (Alaska 1973); Wetzler v. Wetzler, 570 P.2d 741 (Alaska 1977); Faro v. Faro, 579 P.2d 1377 (Alaska 1978); Bonjour v. Bonjour, 592 P.2d 1233 (Alaska 1979); Starkweather v. Curritt, 636 P.2d 1181 (Alaska 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Between parents, custody is to be awarded according to the best interests of the child. Veazey v. Veazey, 560 P.2d 382 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        In sifting and weighing the often emotionally charged and diametrically opposed testimony of the parties, Alaska decisions and Alaska’s positive law require that the trial court’s resolution of custody issues be determined by the paramount criterion of the best interests of the child. Horutz v. Horutz, 560 P.2d 397 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The primary goal of the court in awarding custody is to further the best interests of the child, which includes respecting the beliefs of a mature child, whether they be religious or nonreligious. Bonjour v. Bonjour, 592 P.2d 1233 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court found that the children’s best interests required that they remain with the mother, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed the mother to retain custody. Pearson v. Pearson, 5 P.3d 239 (Alaska 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        In child custody proceedings, the best interests of the child is the paramount consideration, and the father’s argument that the superior court’s decision was “prejudicial” to him did not provide sufficient grounds for reversing the superior court’s order awarding custody to the mother. R.I. v. C.C., 9 P.3d 274 (Alaska 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Best interests of the child according to the child custody factors listed in subsection (c) do not include a blood-relative placement. Adoption of L.E.K.M., 70 P.3d 1097 (Alaska 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court adequately considered several factors to support its conclusion that awarding the custody of a divorcing couple’s children to the wife was properly within the children’s best interests; the trial court’s finding that supervised visitation with the husband could be authorized after a psychological assessment was appropriate. Rodvik v. Rodvik, 151 P.3d 338 (Alaska 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where parents who had joint custody of their daughter disagreed on obtaining a passport for the daughter, the trial court should have taken into account the child’s best interests, which include the opportunity for foreign travel. The mother should have been ordered to consent. Patrawke v. Liebes, 285 P.3d 268 (Alaska 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court properly awarded the parents shared physical and joint legal custody of their children because it was in their children’s best interests where, inter alia, the record was replete with evidence, including the mother’s own admissions, supporting a finding that the mother’s conduct interfered with the children’s reunification counseling and their relationship with their father. Caroline J. v. Theodore J., 354 P.3d 1085 (Alaska 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court did not err by awarding custody of the children to the father because it considered each of the best interest factors, the superior court held hearings over two days and considered the custody investigator's reports before issuing its custody order, and the record supported each of the determinations that the challenged best interest factors favored the father.

        While a court determining custody must always consider each of the statutory factors, it need not refer to all of them in explaining its decision, but need only discuss those factors that it considers actually relevant in light of the evidence presented in the case before it.

        Where the court’s brief findings did not disclose active consideration of more than one factor, and where there was an indication that it specifically declined to consider at least one factor, not only was effective appellate review precluded but the party not awarded custody was deprived of any reliable means of determining if the court based its custody decision on any factual or legal error, and reversal and remand was required.

        The trial court did not commit error in considering the manner and circumstances in which mother left the marital home, her lack of contact with the children after she left, and the effect of her conduct on the children. These were not improper factors because the negative impact of the mother’s conduct on the children was pertinent to the best interests of the children and her capability and desire to address their emotional needs.

        When one parent who was seeking custody planned to relocate out of state, the trial court had to treat the move as a given and conduct a best-interests-of-the-children analysis as if the parents were in different states; the court had to consider the reasons for the parent’s move and, if those reasons were legitimate, then the trial court could not hold the relocation against the parent who was intending to move, such that the trial court did not apply the correct standard in analyzing the consequences of a relocation by the father.

        Trial judge did not fail to consider the required factors when awarding legal custody to the father, as she found relevant the parties’ inability to work together cooperatively, the father’s increased ability to provide for the child’s needs, the concern that the mother’s husband lacked appropriate parenting skills or experience, and the mother’s and husband’s possible use of illegal drugs.

        Superior court did not abuse its discretion by restricting the wife's use of alcohol and other substances while she had custody of the child where the court adequately explained, and the record supported, its findings as to the wife's alcohol use and the risk of violence to the child, neither parent accepted or understood that continued substance use could have exposed the child to harm, and the parents' substance abuse had exacerbated domestic violence and led to incarceration.

        Although a father committed at least two acts of domestic violence during the parties’ marriage, which triggered the statutory presumption against giving him custody, findings that the children were not at risk of harm from the father were supported not only by the testimony of experts who evaluated the parties but also by the wife’s concession that the danger of harm to the children was outweighed by their need to have contact with their father.

       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court did not err in declining to find that a father had committed acts of domestic violence against a mother because it was within the superior court’s discretion to decline to give a protective order collateral estoppel effect, and that the discretion was not abused; the superior court determined that because of the relatively quick dismissal of the order and its role in the custody negotiations, the father had little incentive to litigate it fully.

       <p>
        Although a father challenged the superior court’s finding that there was no evidence of recent, relevant domestic violence, the only evidence of any domestic violence which would favor the father’s position appeared in the “parenting concerns” he shared with the custody investigator, where he alleged that the mother hit him during arguments and threw water on him. But the custody investigator ultimately found no evidence of domestic violence, child abuse, or neglect in either of the proposed custodial households and that there was no other evidence to support the father’s allegation that the mother hit him.

        The interests of long-term stability and continuity favored the award of primary physical custody to the father.

       <p>
        Award of custody to a mother was proper. Although there were some issues with mother’s possible propensity for domestic violence, only one act on her part was found to constitute domestic violence. Other incidents, including pinching and throwing objects, occurring over a number of years, were not enough to classify the mother as someone with a history of perpetrating domestic violence. Clark v. Clark, — P.3d — (Alaska Sept. 26, 2012), (memorandum opinion).
       </p>
       <p>
        Award of sole legal and physical custody of the parties’ children to the mother was appropriate where the father did not overcome the domestic violence presumption in subsection (g); in light of his strong denial of mistreating his children in a manner that resulted in their alienation, he had not dealt with his conduct in a meaningful way.

       <p>
        In a child custody case, a trial court did not err by failing to apply a domestic violence presumption because it was not clearly erroneous to find that a father did not have a history of domestic violence; both the mother and father gave conflicting accounts of alleged assaults, and courts in both Alaska and Massachusetts expressed doubts about the mother’s credibility regarding alleged incidents of physical or sexual abuse. Yelena R. v. George R., 326 P.3d 989 (Alaska 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was only one proven instance of domestic violence by the father, the mother did not prove more than 30 other domestic violence allegations, and she exaggerated carelessly, or simply fabricated claims, reducing the credibility of her allegations. Given this, the father did not have a history of domestic violence and the statutory presumption barring parents with a history of domestic violence from having custody of children did not apply. McAlpine v. Pacarro, — P.3d — (Alaska Oct. 8, 2014)(memorandum decision).

       <p>
        Mother was properly awarded child custody because, inter alia, the father’s actions, including statutory rape of the mother, violation of a domestic violence protection order, and striking another child, triggered the presumption in subsection (g) against awarding the father custody.

       </p>
       <p>
        In a child custody case, a remand was appropriate after an award of joint physical custody to both parents because the trial court’s findings were ambiguous as to whether the father committed more than one act of domestic violence in the context of the rebuttable presumption under this statute. Faye H. v. James B., 348 P.3d 876 (Alaska 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court did not err by failing to apply the statutory presumption against custody by the father in making its custody determination as the mother failed to prove her allegations of abuse because, al- though the mother repeatedly alleged that she had been the victim of abuse, she presented scant evidence to prove those allegations, despite the superior court’s repeated efforts to elicit examples of specific conduct that she considered abusive. Kristi N. v. Christopher R. (Alaska Mar. 9, 2016) (memorandum decision).

        Father was properly awarded child custody because the mother's domestic violence precluded awarding her custody, based on acts rising to the level of fourth degree assault, consisting of throwing a television remote at the father, causing bruising, and drugging the father with methadone.

        Award of equal custody clearly falls within the meaning of “joint physical custody” for purposes of this section, and the Alaska Supreme Court cautions courts against using the unsupervised visitation provision to bypass the requirements for allowing custody under the provision related to domestic violence.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because the father had a history of domestic violence, the superior court was required to find that he had rebutted the domestic violence presumption before granting him joint physical custody; because there was no such finding the order was vacated and the case was remanded.

       <p>
        Although a husband objected to application of the rebuttable domestic violence presumption because he was surprised by the wife's request to apply the presumption, he could have asked for a continuance to conduct discovery when the wife raised the issue, or he could have filed a timely motion to reopen the evidence following the superior court's application of the presumption against him. Because the husband failed to do any of these things, it was reasonable to find he was not entitled to introduce new evidence over a month after the superior court's decision. Burns-Marshall v. Krogman, 433 P.3d 1121 (Alaska 2018).

        Mother was properly granted sole legal and primary physical custody of the parties' child because an Oregon court found multiple acts of domestic violence by the father, and two specific instances of physical violence when the father grabbed the mother by the hair and held her chin, and when he burned her arm by pushing her against a woodstove; other than disagreeing, the father made no effort to show why those findings were clearly erroneous; and it was not a mistake for the superior court to have found that the father - not the mother - was a perpetrator of domestic violence; thus, the father's challenge to the domestic violence presumption was rejected, and he could not be awarded sole or joint legal or physical custody of the child.

        Alaska Supreme Court does not read the first condition for overcoming the presumption in

        Trial court did not clearly err by finding that the father rebutted the statutory presumption under subsection (g) against awarding him custody; the trial court did not err by relying on evidence that the father had applied for entry to a batterers' program but was found unsuited for it.
        Joy B. v. Everett B., 451 P.3d 365 (Alaska 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court may consider the nature of the domestic violence when deciding whether the presumption against awarding custody to the perpetrator has been overcome; therefore, the trial court did not err when it considered the seriousness of the father's incidents of domestic violence, and specifically their situational nature, in the context of deciding whether he had overcome the presumption against awarding him custody of the parties' child. Joy B. v. Everett B., 451 P.3d 365 (Alaska 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether the superior court abused its discretion by refusing to allow a father's counselor to testify as an expert was moot because whether the father was likely to successfully complete the batterers' intervention program was no longer an issue; the only conditions remaining on the father's ability to have unsupervised visitation involved the substance abuse assessment, his compliance, and establishing that he was no longer abusing alcohol, issues not addressed by the counselor.

        Finding that father in a child custody case was not engaged in selling alcohol and drugs at the father’s home in the state of Washington was not clearly erroneous because proof of that allegation was lacking. Accordingly, it was not clear error for the trial court to award the father sole physical custody of the minor child in Washington, despite evidence that the father did sell alcohol and drugs in Barrow.

        Award of sole legal and primary physical custody of the child to the father was proper where the superior court found that an award of primary physical custody to the mother would stunt the child’s normal develop- mental needs; the child did not express any concern about the father; the child was mature enough that his expressed preference to be with the father was entitled to some weight; and the mother did not prove her allegations of abuse by the father by a preponderance of the evidence as she was unable to provide examples of or details about the father’s alleged abuse to the investigator or during her lengthy testimony.

        Primary physical custody was properly awarded to a father under paragraph (c)(6) because he was more likely to facilitate a relationship between the child and the mother; while he allowed the mother visitation time in addition to court-ordered visitation, she never offered him extra time with the child, and she even shortened his court-ordered visitation.

        Mother had primary physical custody and father was awarded visitation. The mother’s wish to move to the Pacific Northwest to be closer to her ailing parents and to find work for her husband was a substantial change in circumstances that required modification of child custody. The older child’s close relationship with her parents, her fear of having to stay in Alaska without her mother, and concern that the child would become depressed if removed from her mother’s custody constituted best interest factors that favored granting custody to the mother.

        In making the decision to award primary custody to a child’s father, the superior court was within its discretion in finding that the child was not going to an abusive home and, while no evidence showed that the father was abusive to the child and the evidence tying him to other contemporary instances of abuse was weak, a question still remained whether the father should have been subject to the presumption found in subsection (g); thus, it was plain error for the superior court not to further determine whether the father’s previous acts of domestic violence against his first wife constituted a history of perpetrating domestic violence under subsection (h). Michele M. v. Richard R., 177 P.3d 830 (Alaska 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in finding a lack of evidence of domestic violence in the proposed custodial household where the father’s girlfriend’s conduct as described in the protective order application and the trial testimony was not assault, custodial interference, or kidnapping, and the finding that there was no history of domestic violence by either party was not clearly erroneous.

       <p>
        While it was error to order joint legal custody and shared physical custody after finding that the father had a history of domestic violence toward the child’s mother, award of unsupervised visitation to the father was proper where the father did not abuse drugs or alcohol and posed no danger of harm to his son.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in placing conditions on the mother's visitation; the custody investigator testified she was not making any psychological diagnosis but was drawing on her experience to recommend that the mother seek treatment, and the mother's argument that the investigator was unqualified to recommend a specific type of therapy was conclusory and did not show any abuse of discretion.

        In this custody modification case, the lower court abused its discretion in assigning disproportionate weight to grandparent involvement as a factor in the father's favor; there was no evidence that the child's contact with her grandparents would be limited while the mother had custody, so it was purely speculative for the lower court to assume that securing grandparent involvement required giving a higher share of custody to the father.

        The supreme court will reverse determinations of the trial court only where it is convinced that the findings of the trial court are clearly erroneous and the record indicates that an abuse of discretion has occurred. King v. King, 477 P.2d 356 (Alaska 1970); Carle v. Carle, 503 P.2d 1050 (Alaska 1972); Horutz v. Horutz, 560 P.2d 397 (Alaska 1977); Faro v. Faro, 579 P.2d 1377 (Alaska 1978); Bonjour v.

       </p>
       <p>
        On appeal the task of the supreme court is to ascertain whether or not the trial court misapplied the broad discretion vested in it in regard to determination of custody questions, and whether the court’s findings in respect to custodial issues are clearly erroneous. De Hart v. Layman, 536 P.2d 789 (Alaska 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        When called upon to decide whether the trial court abused its discretion in applying the best interests test, the supreme court must at times determine whether the trial court assigned “too great a weight to some factors while ignoring others, perhaps by elevating the interests of one of the parties to the dispute above that of the child, perhaps by making a clearly erroneous finding with respect to some material issue.” Horutz v.

        Trial court did not err in denying the mother’s motion to modify custody because it addressed the factors listed in subsection (c), and its findings provided ample indication of the considerations upon which its decision was based; the mother pointed to no evidence to suggest that the child’s best interests would be better served if she was appointed sole legal custodian.

        The court properly set limitations on a father’s communications with the mother where the father had committed three domestic violence crimes against the mother in the five years preceding the order. Although the trial court found that he did not pose a danger of mental or physical injury to the child, it was not required to ignore his past domestic violence crimes against the mother, his controlling attitudes, or his efforts to reunite with the mother when she did not wish to do so.

        Where the court did not demonstrate consideration of the relevant factors specified in subsection (c) in its order and made no general finding concerning the child’s best interests, the order issed as a result of the hearing was not sufficiently comprehensive to serve as a basis for a general custody change.

        Award of sole custody to mother was in the child’s best interests where the mother adhered to the demands of the child’s special dietary needs, was capable of fostering a continued relationship between the father and the child, and where the father was a firm disciplinarian, which on occasion included severe physical correction of his children.

       <p>
        Court properly modified child custody to the father because the mother lived in four residences in five years, she worked for six employers in five years, the mother admitted that even after ending her substance abuse treatment she was drinking more, and the father’s purchase of a business supported his intention to establish roots in the community. Littleton v. Banks, 192 P.3d 154 (Alaska 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father’s custody modification motion was properly denied because the evidence supported the superior court’s best interests findings that the mother provided the children with a stable, satisfactory environment; the children became stressed during visitation with their father, and the children were very close and should live together. Worthington v. Worthington, — P.3d — (Alaska Aug. 24, 2011), (memorandum opinion).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of father’s motion for custody of his son was proper where the father had not seen the son for several years, had failed to comply with a court order regarding a psychological evaluation, and had not kept up with telephonic visitation. The son was shown to be well-adjusted and successful in his existing custody arrangement. Kurka v. Kurka, — P.3d — (Alaska Nov. 28, 2012), (memorandum opinion).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusion that there was a change in circumstances only provided the basis for a full custody modification hearing, and this conclusion did not control the best interests analysis; at that stage of the analysis, the inability of the parents to communicate was simply one of many statutory factors the trial court was required to consider. Houston v. Wolpert, 332 P.3d 1279 (Alaska 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court conducted a complete analysis of the best interests factors, weighing allegations of domestic violence in the balance along with the other factors, and the superior court’s decision was based not on an adverse domestic violence finding, but on a complete analysis of the best interest factors, and the determination was within the superior court’s discretion.

        After considering the father’s concerns about the mother’s choice to pursue alternative medical care and her opposition to having the children vaccinated, the court nevertheless found that, overall, the mother demonstrated a higher degree of attention to the children’s physical and medical needs than did the father, based primarily on the parties’ testimony. Co v. Matson, 313 P.3d 521 (Alaska 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court’s findings were based primarily on testimony and it was not clear error to conclude 1) that the mother was more likely to facilitate and encourage a relationship with the father; 2) that the father’s continued marijuana use would impact the children in light of its negative effect on the children in the past; and 3) that the father did not keep the children on a consistent, stable schedule. Co v. Matson, 313 P.3d 521 (Alaska 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the court stated that it considered the children’s ages in determining that primary physical custody should go to the mother, that fact alone did not show that the court applied the tender years doctrine. Age of the children, and the need for stability at an early age are properly considered in determining the children’s best interests. The tender years doctrine was an automatic preference for maternal custody of young children, and there was nothing in the court’s findings to indicate such preference was applied. Co v. Matson, 313 P.3d 521 (Alaska 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Award of primary physical and sole legal custody to the father was proper, given that the superior court weighed the evidence in light of the statutory factors and addressed each factor in depth, finding in part that the mother was less capable to care for the children due to her mental health issues, and that the mother’s alcohol abuse created a substantial risk for the children.

        Superior court did not err in modifying custody because its best interests findings were supported by the record; the evidence supported the superior court's findings that the first two factors set forth in subsection (c) favored the mother because she had made extensive efforts to address the child's mental health needs, and the father had not fully recognized or accepted the extent of the child's mental health issues.

       <p>
        Because the trial court’s custody order impacted only one child, the trial court was required to make findings with respect to her best interests, but neither the written nor the oral findings provided a sufficient basis for the appeals court to review whether the order was reasonable; it was not apparent from the written findings how the trial court reached its decision, nor was it clear what statutory factors the trial court considered important.

        Superior court did not abuse its discretion in entering an order modifying custody, which awarded sole legal and physical custody of her three children to the father and limited the mother to supervised visitation pending the children's full engagement in therapy, because the mother's interference with the children's therapy amounted to a change in circumstances, and the children's best interests were served by an award of sole legal and physical custody to the father while therapy took hold as it was within the superior court's broad discretion to determine that the children's special need for psychotherapy was their predominant need and that the mother was not currently capable of supporting that need.

       <p>
        Custody modification was in the child's best interests because the mother had left the child in the care of her boyfriend who had proven himself a poor caregiver and had a violent history; she had allowed the boyfriend to store a gun in her home even after knowing about his prior conviction for a violent crime; and, even when the father was away for work, he provided a more stable environment by leaving the child in the care of responsible adults.

       <p>
        When modifying visitation to limit the mother's visitation to alternating weekends and major holidays, the superior court did not improperly punish her for her failure to comply with prior custody order but rather properly considered how her actions affected her child's best interests, because the appointed custody investigator testified that the child needed therapy and he failed to receive it while in the mother's custody, and the mother would not allow the child to visit the father.

        Superior court did not clearly err in finding that the mother interfered with the relationship between the son and the father because texts between the mother and the son showed that the mother failed to encourage a close and continuing relationship; thus, the superior court did not abuse its discretion maintaining the father's sole legal and primary physical custody over the child.

        Superior court did not clearly err by failing to find that a father was stalking a mother or by finding that the mother's fears of stalking undermined her ability to provide a stable environment because the mother testified about a speculative connection between the father and a car she saw in their neighborhood; the mother's extensive testimony about stalking revealed it to be a source of fear and preoccupation for her.

       <p>
        In a parental relocation case, the court properly analyzed the best interests criteria in awarding the mother custody of the child because there was extensive testimony in the record about the child’s close relationship with his half-sisters, and the court found that both parents did an acceptable job maintaining a stable, satisfactory environment for the child. The superior court considered circumstances that the child was likely to encounter in each environment, such as contact with extended family, and showed due consideration for the statutory “stability” factor.

        Father’s custody was properly expanded: the court did consider the stability factor and determined the child’s stability would not be entirely disrupted with a new custody arrangement since the child would continue to attend the same school and was already adjusted to the father’s care on shorter visits.

The superior court recited the evidence supporting its finding about the mother's primary, legitimate motive and, having found that any ulterior motive was at best secondary, went on to carefully weigh the father's allegations in its best interests analysis.

        Trial court’s finding that the father was less likely than the mother to facilitate a close and continuing relationship with the other parent rested on the trial court’s determination that, inter alia, the father’s claim that it was important for the mother to have contact with the child was not credible and the mother’s testimony as to the importance of communicating with the child about the other parent was credible.

       <p>
        It is perhaps possible to conceive of a case in which, despite the fact that there was apparently no change of circumstances, nevertheless the welfare of the child might require that the previous order of custody be changed, but without some change in circumstance there is no logical basis for a court to alter a determination that has once seriously and finally been made.

       </p>
       <p>
        The concept of “substantial change” of circumstances is not a limitation on the discretion of the trial court to determine custody according to the best interest of the child. Rather, it may be considered simply a rule of judicial economy designed to discourage discontented parents from continually renewing custody proceedings. King v. King, 477 P.2d 356 (Alaska 1970); Nichols v. Nichols, 516 P.2d 732 (Alaska 1973).

       <p>
        The “substantial change” of circumstances is not an initial obstacle to be overcome by either party in order to have the court redetermine custody.

        The superior court gave proper weight to the teenagers’ desire to live with their mother, but their preferences were not mature and well-reasoned, and were outweighed by their need for the “substantial guidance” that the court found the father better equipped to provide.

        It was proper to give significant weight to a 14-year-old son’s preference to move to Virginia with his father.

        No substantial change in circumstances justifying a modification of custody was shown because (1) the parties did not agree to modification, (2) the children stated no such preference, (3) passage of time did not suffice, (4) the parties' inability to communicate was not a change, and (5) a change in a mother's child-care ability was not substantial.

        There was a material change of circumstances due to the mother’s arrests and conduct with her boyfriends that involved domestic violence and a gun.

        In denying the mother’s motion to modify custody, a court did not err in determining that the presumption in subsection (g) did not apply in the case because each party had committed two acts of domestic violence and the violence was “situational;” domestic violence was not likely to recur by either party and it was not a factor that precluded them from sharing custody.

        Superior court found there was no domestic violence to trigger the rebuttable presumption in the statute because the mother’s allegations against the father occurred before the superior court’s custody order in 2005, the criminal charges were dismissed, and there was no evidence that he continued to use corporal punishment against the children.

        Superior court did not err in finding that the mother did not have a history of perpetrating domestic violence where the marks, scratches, and bruises as a result of an assault with a belt were not a serious physical injury, the court declined to expand serious physical injury to include emotional harm, and the assault did not constitute two or more distinct incidents of domestic violence.

        Superior court did not err in limiting the mother to supervised visitation pending the children's full engagement in therapy because the mother had refused to accept the realities of the scope of assistance required for the children, rendering her incapable of supporting the children's special need for psychotherapy; the father was attempting to establish another therapeutic relationship, but the court feared that the mother would sabotage that relationship as well; and the court determined that the only workable option was to limit the mother's negative influence on the children, at least temporarily, so that the therapy could take hold.

       <p>
        A decree awarding the custody of a child to one of the parties, rendered when the child is in another state, does not preclude the courts of the latter state from determining the question of custody of the child, although the court rendering such decree retains jurisdiction for the purpose of making further orders.

       </p>
       <p>
        The full faith and credit clause should be applied in custody cases as a deterrent to child stealing or forum shopping by a litigant. However, where the children had lived in Alaska for a year before the mother obtained a Montana custody order transferring custody to her, the Alaska court did not err in failing to accord full faith and credit to the Montana modification order. Wilsonoff v. Wilsonoff, 514 P.2d 1264 (Alaska 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        A child’s welfare has such a great claim upon a state that this responsibility was not to be foreclosed by a prior adjudication made by another state. Wilsonoff v. Wilsonoff, 514 P.2d 1264 (Alaska 1973); Layman v. De Hart, 560 P.2d 1206 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a sister state’s decree should not be ignored in custody matters, strict application of the full faith and credit clause would result in a default of the court’s responsibility to ensure the welfare of minor children domiciled in Alaska.

         Application of “clean hands” doctrine. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The “clean hands” doctrine is generally considered a device for resolving problems of custody jurisdiction among the states and is most commonly invoked when a court is asked to either enforce or modify a custody decree of a sister state. King v. King, 477 P.2d 356 (Alaska 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The “clean hands” doctrine serves no purpose in a setting where the court is asked to modify its own custody award as specifically allowed by the statute. King v. King, 477 P.2d 356 (Alaska 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts will recognize and enforce custody decrees of a sister state without reexamination of their merits, regardless of change of conditions, when there is misconduct or malfeasance on the part of the parent seeking such reexamination, by invoking the doctrine of “clean hands.”
        This misconduct generally consists of defiantly leaving a sister state, usually the marital domicile, with the minor to avoid its jurisdiction and for the purpose of seeking redetermination of the issue in a more favorable forum. King v. King, 477 P.2d 356 (Alaska 1970).

       The superior court properly rejected the wife’s proposal for a bifurcation of the legal divorce where she wanted the court to divide the property immediately, but to delay the legal divorce for three years so she could continue health insurance as a spouse under the husband’s coverage without having to pay COBRA premiums. Although paragraph (a)(2) and other statutes limit the situations in which custody determinations or property divisions in divorce proceedings can be reserved until later, no statute permits the reservation of a divorce decree.

The debt remained presumptively marital because the transaction occurred before the parties were separated. Richter v. Richter, 330 P.3d 934 (Alaska 2014).

       </p>
       <p>
        Because a divorce can raise special concerns about the financial support of children, the Alaska supreme court approved the use of insurance as security for a support obligation where appropriate; however, the provision in a trial court’s order requiring maintenance of an insurance policy until a child graduated from college or reached 25 years apparently was designed to insure payments for post-majority college costs and was modified to require maintenance of insurance until the child reached 18.

        <b>
         Payments voluntarily made to the children are not to be credited against child support obligations.
        </b>
        The rationale is that such voluntary payments to the children quite often are intended for particular purposes whereas the manner in which child support payments are used to meet the children’s basic needs is left to the discretion of the parent or guardian with custody. Young v. Williams, 583 P.2d 201 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a defendant husband is required by a divorce decree to pay to the plaintiff money for the support of the children, and the unpaid and accrued installments become judgments in favor of the plaintiff he cannot, as a matter of law, claim credit on account of payments voluntarily made directly to the children, though special considerations of an equitable nature may justify a court in crediting such payments on his indebtedness to the plaintiff when that can be done without injustice to the plaintiff-wife.

       <p>
        In determining whether separate property acquired before marriage should be invaded, the court should particularly consider factors such as the duration of the marriage, the conduct of the parties during the marriage, the manner of acquisition of the property, its value at the time of acquisition and at the time of the property division, and any other factors bearing on whether the equities dictate that the other spouse is entitled to share in that property.

       <p>
        A spousal support judgment in favor of the wife was not void due to lack of due process when the judgment was entered because the husband had notice that spousal support would be addressed, he knew the wife’s mental state and indigence would be relied on for an award, and a pretrial order explicitly included spousal support as a trial issue. The husband was not barred from discovering the wife’s finances or mental state, and his failure to conduct discovery did not mean his due process notice was insufficient.

        The factors to be considered in an alimony award are the same as those that are relevant where the sole issue is the division of marital property but, while those factors, which the supreme court has set out in various cases, do supply some guidance as to when and to what extent alimony is “just and necessary,” they are not substitutes for the statutory standard, nor are they all that should be said about the standard.

         Considerations in determining whether to award alimony. —

       </p>
       <p>
        Section 308 of the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act and the comment pertaining thereto should be considered, together with the factors mentioned in such cases as Schoning v. Schoning, 550 P.2d 373 (Alaska 1976), in determining when it is necessary and just that alimony be awarded. Messina v. Messina, 583 P.2d 804 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 308 of the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act, approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and recommended for passage by the states by the American Bar Association, provides for alimony only if the spouse seeking maintenance: (1) lacks sufficient property to provide for his reasonable needs; and (2) is unable to support himself through appropriate employment or is the custodian of a child whose condition or circumstances make it appropriate that the custodian may not be required to seek employment outside the home. Messina v. Messina, 583 P.2d 804 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The comment pertaining to these provisions states that the intention of the provisions of the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act relating to alimony is to encourage the court to provide for the financial needs of the spouses by property disposition rather than by an award of maintenance.
        Only if the available property is insufficient for the purpose and if the spouse who seeks maintenance is unable to secure employment appropriate to his skills and interests or is occupied with child care may an award of maintenance be ordered. Messina v. Messina, 583 P.2d 804 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not an abuse of discretion to award the wife spousal support where the court properly considered a number of the statutory factors, including difference in annual gross income and the effect of the wife’s upcoming surgery on her income; there was no indication that the wife’s injuries from a car accident or her work-related injuries affected the award. Novak v. Novak, — P.3d — (Alaska Aug. 26, 2015)(memorandum decision).
       </p>
       <p>
        Further findings were required as to an alimony award because (1) the court did not find if a greater allocation of the marital estate would meet a wife's needs, and (2) it was error to defer to the wife's preference to receive alimony instead of a larger share of the marital estate.

        An award of $5,500 in cash for reorientation to be taken out of husband’s retirement account may violate the preference for property division over alimony.

       <p>
        Since a court may award alimony of indefinite duration when it is just and necessary, there was no abuse of discretion where the court carefully considered the evidence in light of the statutory factors and justified a long-term award on the basis of the wife’s lack of work experience, her responsibilities as her child’s primary custodial parent, her deafness, her lack of job prospects, and her limited ability to retrain for employment.

        Process of classifying marital property in a divorce is not an end in itself but simply serves to inform the trial court’s decision on the ultimate issue of what constitutes an equitable distribution of the marital estate. Because the trial court exercises broad discretion in making its final equitable determination, a classification error will result in prejudice only when it appears that the error probably had an appreciable effect on the ultimate determination of equitable distribution.

        In light of the wife’s age, existing and future health problems, her limited earning capacity, the 25 years duration of the marriage, and the fact that a substantial amount of the properties awarded to her were purchased with her separate inheritance funds, a just division of the property of the parties required invasion of the husband’s separate property, i.e., his California property, and the award of some portion of the husband’s interest in this property to his wife.

        In a divorce action, a trial court erred under this section when it distributed to the wife 60 percent of the parties’ marital property because, although the husband was healthier and had greater earning capacity than the wife, whose injuries would probably require more medical care and limit her future employment options, it was error to find that the refinancing of the house was a source of financial detriment when the proceeds paid marital debts and the trial court did not consider the rental value of an apartment contained within the house. Additionally, finding a vehicle had a negative value, when in fact nothing was owed on it at the time that it was traded in, was error, as was deducting that value from the wife’s vehicle account, but the marital funds the wife retained at the time of separation were later reasonably expended by the wife to support herself and her children, and the wife’s anticipated receipt of child support arrearages did not amount to a double recovery.

        There was no error where the trial court discussed each applicable statutory factor and stated that it based its decision to distribute the marital assets unequally primarily on the parties’ unequal earning power, stations in life, and conduct during the marriage, specifically focusing on its factual finding that the wife’s earning power was less than half of the husband’s.

        In arriving at an equitable distribution of marital assets, courts should only consider a party’s military disability benefits as they affect the financial circumstances of both parties; disability benefits should not, either in form or substance, be treated as marital property subject to division upon the dissolution of marriage.

       <p>
        In contrast to military retirement and railroad retirement pay, Congress in 1978 specifically added a provision to the civil service retirement laws concerning retirement payments as marital property and, since there is no conflict between Alaska marital property rules and the federal statute (5 U.S.C. § 8345(j)(1)), there is no reason to overrule the superior court’s classification of the husband’s federal civil service retirement benefits as a marital asset. Monsma v. Monsma, 618 P.2d 559 (Alaska 1980) (decided prior to 1990 amendment specifically providing for division of retirement benefits).

       <p>
        Where a provision in a property settlement agreement elected survivorship benefits as a means of dividing the former husband’s civil service pension, but where the former wife remarried before age fifty-five and federal regulations therefore rendered enforcement of the agreement impossible, the superior court had no jurisdiction to enforce that provision, and the agreement was subject to modification.

         Factors to be considered. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether a change in circumstances justifies a reduction in one parent’s child support obligation, the court must consider both the needs of the child or children supported as well as the needs and financial abilities of both parties. Curley v. Curley, 588 P.2d 289 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        One factor that may be considered is whether the child’s needs are less than they were at the time of the divorce. More commonly, however, the child’s needs are the same or greater than they were at the time of entry of a support order, and it is the moving parent’s needs that are greater or whose income is less.
        In such cases, the trial court must examine the financial situation of both parents and determine whether the equities justify placing a greater burden on one and a correspondingly lesser burden on the other. Curley v. Curley, 588 P.2d 289 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        A spousal support judgment in favor of the wife was not void due to a lack of due process when the judgment was entered because the husband had notice that spousal support would be addressed, he knew the wife’s mental state and indigence would be relied on for an award, and a pretrial order explicitly included spousal support as a trial issue. The husband was not barred from discovering the wife’s finances or mental state, and his failure to conduct discovery did not mean his due process notice was insufficient. The order finding the judgment void did not address the sufficiency of the trial court’s procedures but the sufficiency of the evidence, which was only properly addressed on appeal, which was not pursued. Blaufuss v. Ball, 305 P.3d 281 (Alaska 2013).

        As a general rule, a substantial reduction in or cessation of a spouse’s income is a factor that may justify or require a reduction in alimony or maintenance. Hinchey v. Hinchey, 722 P.2d 949 (Alaska 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a settlement agreement set husband’s child support at a minimum amount, “irrespective of his income” and subsequently his income fell 15% below his income in the year of the agreement, denial of his motion to modify support on the ground that unequal distribution of property provided sufficient consideration for the agreement was error; husband was entitled to modification of his obligation under the guidelines of Civil Rule 90.3.

        A trial court should be reluctant to modify child support obligations when the obligor’s loss of income appears only temporary. Patch v. Patch, 760 P.2d 526 (Alaska 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a court is asked to reduce a child support obligation where the parent seeking the reduction is temporarily employed at an income level that does not accurately reflect past and future income levels, the court may properly consider the availability of liquid assets (such as a father’s pension fund) to satisfy an ongoing child support obligation. Patch v. Patch, 760 P.2d 526 (Alaska 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even where a noncustodial parent loses a job by other than voluntary resignation, the trial court must consider all the circumstances of the change in employment to determine whether a modification of child support is warranted. Patch v. Patch, 760 P.2d 526 (Alaska 1988).

        Where father sought a reduction in support less than a year after entry of the divorce decree on the basis that his income had been reduced and his expenses had increased, but some of his expenses were related to providing housing for himself and his emancipated son, the superior court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reduce the father’s child support obligation.

       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court did not abuse its discretion in denying a former wife’s motion to extend her spousal support because none of her arguments identified a material and substantial change in circumstances and the court had thoroughly discussed her health problems, age, employment history, medical expenses, and health insurance.

        In a child support modification proceeding, the trial court abused its discretion under Alaska R. Civ.

       Superior court did not violate this section because this section governed proceedings during which a dissolution decree was issued and was irrelevant to a former wife’s enforcement motion; moreover, the superior court did not amend a property agreement, it simply interpreted it under contract principles. McCarter v. McCarter, 303 P.3d 509 (Alaska 2013).

      <p>
       There was ample evidence to support the superior court’s findings, and the findings reinforced the conclusion that the parties intended to split the income derived from an ex-husband’s commercial fishing less costs for fuel and cannery dues. Contrary to the ex-husband’s argument that the superior court improperly modified the terms of the dissolution agreement, interpreting the dissolution provisions to clarify confusing language and resolve an ambiguity was not only appropriate, but required under Alaska case law. Mahan v. Mahan, 347 P.3d 91 (Alaska 2015).

       Where dissolution decree was properly set aside on grounds of fraud, it was error to re-divide marital property in response to a motion without giving husband advance notice or an opportunity for a hearing on the property division issues. Song v. Song, 972 P.2d 589 (Alaska 1999).

        Jurisdiction to make child custody determination. —

       The superior court has no jurisdiction to make the “child custody determination” that is a prerequisite to the entry of a decree of dissolution under subsection (a) unless one of the conditions listed in AS 25.30.020(a) exists. Layne v. Niles, 632 P.2d 234 (Alaska 1981).

        A finding of “full understanding”

        Applicability. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case seeking enforcement of a property settlement agreement, the court did not have to make factual findings under this section because, while they were necessary to the issuance of a final decree, they were irrelevant to its enforcement in a subsequent proceedings. The former wife was not seeking relief in a petition filed under the dissolution statutes but was seeking enforcement of the final judgment. McCarter v. McCarter, 303 P.3d 509 (Alaska 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Property division portion of a dissolution agreement was invalid where the evidence did not support the conclusion that the wife fully understood the consequences of signing the dissolution petition at the time she signed it, the evidence having indicated that neither party was aware of the wife’s right to share in properties listed in the husband’s name. Crafts v. Morgan, 776 P.2d 1049 (Alaska 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before a proposed property division can take effect, a court must find that both spouses understand fully the nature and consequences of their action, and that the proposed division constitutes the entire agreement between the parties. Musser v. Johnson, 914 P.2d 1241 (Alaska 1996).

      </p>
      <p>
       Although a husband’s support obligation is regarded as extending only to children “of the marriage,” a mistake in the determination of paternity is not regarded as jurisdictional error and the superior court can enforce an agreement to support a child even though both parties to the dissolution action later admit that the child was born out of wedlock.

When custody, support, or visitation is at issue in a divorce, it is the responsibility of the parties or their counsel to notify the court that such a matter is at issue. Upon notification, the court shall determine whether the minor or other child should have legal representation or other services and shall make a finding on the record before trial. If the parties are indigent or temporarily without funds, the court shall appoint the office of public advocacy. The court shall notify the office of public advocacy if the office is required to provide legal representation or other services.

The court shall require a guardian ad litem when, in the opinion of the court, representation of the child’s best interests, to be distinguished from preferences, would serve the welfare of the child. The court in its order appointing a guardian ad litem shall limit the duration of the appointment of the guardian ad litem to the pendency of the legal proceedings affecting the child’s interests, and shall outline the guardian ad litem’s responsibilities and limit the authority to those matters related to the guardian’s effective representation of the child’s best interests in the pending legal proceeding.

      </p>
      <p>
       Section 310 of the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, which provides for the appointment of an attorney to represent the interests of a minor or dependent child with respect to his support, custody and visitation, is similar to this section. Veazey v. Veazey, 560 P.2d 382 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        This section gives the trial court discretion to appoint an attorney or guardian ad litem
       </b>
       for a child in a proceeding “without respect to his custody, support, and visitation, or in any other legal proceeding involving his welfare.” Veazey v. Veazey, 560 P.2d 382 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The supreme court cannot lay down a definite rule for guiding the trial courts in their decision whether to appoint guardians ad litem, since no two child custody cases are alike. Of necessity, the trial court has a considerable amount of discretion in making this decision. Veazey v. Veazey, 560 P.2d 382 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The fact that one or all of the custody claimants favor or oppose the appointment of a guardian ad litem
       </b>
       is not necessarily conclusive. Veazey v. Veazey, 560 P.2d 382 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Appointment is not compelled where unnecessary. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In custody cases in which a guardian is not needed, neither this section, the court rules, nor supreme court decisions compel the court to waste its time and money, as well as that of the parties and counsel, in employing one. Veazey v. Veazey, 560 P.2d 382 (Alaska 1977); Hinchey v. Hinchey, 625 P.2d 297 (Alaska 1981), overruled, Dowling v. Dowling, 679 P.2d 480 (Alaska 1984).

        Discretion of court in appointing guardian ad litem. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In many custody cases appointment of a guardian ad litem is not needed, and in those cases it is not compelled by statute, the court rules, or the supreme court’s decisions. No two custody cases are alike. Of necessity, the trial court has a considerable amount of discretion in making this decision. Carter v. Brodrick, 816 P.2d 202 (Alaska 1991).

       <b>
        When guardian ad litem to be appointed. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In custody proceedings a guardian ad litem should be appointed when appointment would substantially enhance the likelihood that the individual needs and interests of the children would be adequately represented. Lacy v. Lacy, 553 P.2d 928 (Alaska 1976); Hinchey v. Hinchey, 625 P.2d 297 (Alaska 1981), overruled, Dowling v. Dowling, 679 P.2d 480 (Alaska 1984).

       <b>
        Basis for decision to appoint guardian. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The decision whether to appoint a guardian ad litem would appear to depend in large measure on the age of the children and the nature of the claim being advanced by the parent or parents. Lacy v. Lacy, 553 P.2d 928 (Alaska 1976); Veazey v. Veazey, 560 P.2d 382 (Alaska 1977); Hinchey v. Hinchey, 625 P.2d 297 (Alaska 1981), overruled, Dowling v. Dowling, 679 P.2d 480 (Alaska 1984).

       <b>
        Failure to make findings as to need for guardian. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Grant of a motion made by the children’s guardian ad litem for fees and costs of defending the superior court’s child custody determination was error where the superior court failed to follow subsection (c), in that it failed to make a finding on the record that the minor children’s best interest and welfare required the services of a guardian in connection with the appeal. Furthermore, the guardian’s responsibilities and authority in effectively representing the children’s best interests in the appeal were never outlined by the superior court. Rich v. Berry, 857 P.2d 341 (Alaska 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court erred in denying mother’s motion for the appointment of a guardian ad litem in a child custody dispute because the superior court failed to make any findings; on remand, superior court was ordered to make findings explaining whether the appointment of a guardian ad litem was necessary. Iverson v. Griffith, 180 P.3d 943 (Alaska 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Failure to appoint guardian not abuse of discretion. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where neither party could suggest any specific benefit a guardian might bring to the custody modification proceedings, and appointment of a guardian ad litem would have necessitated postponement of the hearing, the superior court did not abuse its discretion in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem for the two minor children. Lacy v. Lacy, 553 P.2d 928 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of motion for appointment of guardian ad litem was not abuse of discretion. Hinchey v. Hinchey, 625 P.2d 297 (Alaska 1981), overruled, Dowling v. Dowling, 679 P.2d 480 (Alaska 1984).

        No plain error in failure to appoint guardian ad litem. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not plain error for a trial court to neither consider the appointment of a guardian ad litem (GAL) in a child custody matter, nor appoint one on its own motion when neither parent requested the appointment of a GAL because there was no indication from the record that the case was unusually complex, that the appointment of a GAL was necessary to develop the evidence, or that the parents would be unable to adequately present or protect the children's best interests.

       By providing that the costs of services to be provided for the protection of the child will be assessed against the parties, and that the court may advance such costs to parties temporarily without funds, subsection (b) of this section suggests that it is contemplated that such services typically are to be performed by a private agency.

       The vague directive of this section that in a private custody dispute the court may order that “services be provided for the protection of the child” does not empower a court to command the aid of the department of health and social services in a private custody dispute.

      </p>
      <p>
       The petition’s failure to include a prayer for arrearages did not justify dismissal of the claim since the function of a pleading is to give notice of the type of claim asserted, the body of the petition stated that defendant had contributed nothing toward the support of his daughter, and the motion for an order of support specifically requested arrearages; therefore, defendant had notice of the claim for arrearages at the very latest by the date when the motion was filed.

The payments were treated as an absolute obligation that was part of the child support obligation without conditions concerning geographical limitation, impracticality, lack of information about the mother’s whereabouts, reimbursement for actual child care expenses, or credit for nonweekend visitation.

      Within 30 days after issuance of a modified child support order, the party obtaining the modification shall file a certified copy of the order with the issuing tribunal that had continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the earlier order and with each tribunal in which the party knows that an earlier order has been registered. Failure of the party obtaining the order to file a certified copy as required subjects that party to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises, but that failure has no effect on the validity or enforceability of the modified order of the new tribunal of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

        Purpose of chapter. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The express intent of the legislature with regard to the provisions of this chapter has consistently been to increase the ability of the state to enforce child support obligations and, toward that goal, to impose federally mandated liability on employers who fail to aid in that enforcement effort. Child Support Recovery Servs. ex rel. S.C. v. Inn at the Waterfront, Inc., 7 P.3d 63 (Alaska 2000).

       Subsection (b), which references the “immediate duty of support,” is inapplicable to a Child Support Enforcement Division (now the Child Support Services Agency) claim to recover public assistance. Department of Revenue, Child Support Enforcement Div. v. Green, 983 P.2d 1249 (Alaska 1999).

        Factors to be considered. —

      </p>
      <p>
       In the Aid for Families with Dependent Children reimbursement context, the Child Support Enforcement Division (now the Child Support Services Agency) need not determine the “amount of money an obligor must pay to satisfy the immediate duty of support,” but only needs to look at the amount of public assistance paid and the amount of support provided for in the court order. Department of Revenue, Child Support Enforcement Div. v. Green, 983 P.2d 1249 (Alaska 1999).

        Interest on support arrearage. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, a Washington court’s recalculation and modification of father’s child support did not supersede the original Alaska support order, and the Child Support Enforcement Division (now the Child Support Services Agency) was entitled to collect interest on father’s support arrearage. Department of Revenue ex rel. Wallace v. Delaney, 962 P.2d 187 (Alaska 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Merely because child support payments were originally due to an ex-wife, the Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED) (now the Child Support Services Agency) was not precluded from charging the father interest on arrearages, since this section clearly indicates that the legislature did not intend for the CSED (now CSSA) to turn a blind eye to overdue payments simply because the agency was not yet directly involved in their collection. Brown v. Brown, 983 P.2d 1264 (Alaska 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Father could not avoid interest payments on child support arrearages by arguing that he had not received a computerized billing statement from the Child Support Enforcement Division (now the Child Support Services Agency) in the mail, since the superior court’s order notified him of his obligations. Brown v. Brown, 983 P.2d 1264 (Alaska 1999).

       , an order of support establishes a relationship by which the custodian of the child is the administrator for the purposes of administering child support on behalf of the child. The court shall carefully consider the need for support, the ability of both parents to meet such support obligations, the extent to which the parents supported the child before divorce, and the economic ability of the parents to pay after separation and divorce. The court shall also consider the effect on the support obligation of a change in custodian. The need of the child for support shall be considered regardless of the sex of the parent awarded custody of the child.

The medical support order shall require health care insurance coverage for the child if health care insurance coverage is available to either parent or both parents for the child at a reasonable cost. The court or agency shall consider whether the child is eligible for services through the Indian Health Service or other insurance coverage before ordering either parent or both parents to provide health care coverage through insurance, cash medical support, or other means or a combination of insurance, cash medical support, or other means. The court or agency shall allocate equally the cost of health care insurance for the child between the parents unless there is good cause to allocate the costs unequally. If the obligor has the duty to make periodic payments for non-medical child support, the obligor’s periodic payments shall be decreased by the amount of the other parent’s portion of payments for health insurance ordered by the court or agency and actually paid by the obligor. If the obligor has a duty to make periodic payments for non-medical child support, the periodic payments shall be increased by the obligor’s portion of payments for health insurance if the other parent is ordered to and actually does obtain and pay for insurance. The court or agency shall allocate equally between the parents the cost of reasonable health care expenses not covered by private insurance unless there is good cause to allocate the costs unequally. One parent shall reimburse the other parent for the first parent’s share of the uncovered expenses paid by the parent within 30 days after receipt by the first parent of the bill for the health care, payment verification, and, if applicable, a health insurance statement indicating what portion of the cost is uncovered.

       Income assignment order can be used to collect a judgment for back child support accruing before the order of support was issued. Ralston v. State, Child Support Enf't Div. ex rel. Wall, 728 P.2d 635 (Alaska 1986).

       Although this section does not speak specifically to whether arrearages include amounts owed due to a judgment of back child support, the purposes behind the section justify use of an income assignment order to collect accrued back child support; there is no language in AS 47 that explicitly prohibits such use.

       Where defendant acknowledged his paternity of the child because he erroneously believed he was her father, and nine years later pursued an administrative appeal and disestablished his paternity in superior court, because CSED’s (now CSSA’s) support order remained open to review, and because he rebutted the presumption of paternity created by his legal acknowledgment at his first formal opportunity, the superior court prohibited CSED (now CSSA) from collecting arrears.

       Although a support order that does not require the noncustodial parent to make any child support payment is not a “support order” under subsection (a), the Child Support Enforcement Division (now the Child Support Services Agency) is entitled to reimbursement from the noncustodial parent for public assistance provided to the child in an amount determined by the state in accordance with a formula approved by the federal Secretary of Health and Human Services.

      </p>
      <p>
       In the Aid for Families with Dependent Children reimbursement context, the Child Support Enforcement Division (now the Child Support Services Agency) need not determine the “amount of money an obligor must pay to satisfy the immediate duty of support,” but only needs to look at the amount of public assistance paid and the amount of support provided for in the court order.

       Although unrefuted evidence showed that appellant father’s second attorney had actual notice of a new child support order, supplemental information that was added to the record — a motion to stay enforcement that was filed within the appeal period under Alaska R. App. P. 602(a)(2) and this section — showed that the attorney may not have been aware of the order and was confused about the administrative remand proceedings. Dobrova v.

       Because there was no recent adverse administrative decision from which father might conceivably have been appealing, intervention by superior court would not likely have allowed father to correct his failings, and superior court addressed what seemed to be the merits of father’s claim in its refusal to order retroactive modification of his support obligation; supreme court was not “left with a definite and firm conviction, after reviewing the whole record, that trial court erred in its ruling,” and therefore did not abuse discretion in denying father’s possible administrative appeal rather than attempting to remedy it.

       Where a presumed father did not provide any points or authorities, and did not make clear the defenses he desired to assert in opposition to Child Support Enforcement Division (now the Child Support Services Agency) collection efforts, but where this section seemingly created an automatic right to a hearing upon the filing of an affidavit offering “any” defense other than payment, the superior court had discretion to require, before conducting a hearing, that the father offer prima facie evidence of a successful defense under standards set out in Civil Rule 77(c)(2). Kilpper v. Department of Revenue, Child Support Enforcement Div., 983 P.2d 729 (Alaska 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Without express notice of the superior court’s intent to hold the plaintiff to the standards of Civil Rule 77(c)(2), a presumed father reasonably might have taken the language of this section at face value and assumed from its literal language that his affidavit’s vague offer of defenses would suffice to give him a hearing at which he would be able to flesh out his claims, and remand was required to give him an additional opportunity to assert his defenses with sufficient specificity to meet the requirements of the Rule.

      <p>
       When the child support enforcement division (now the Child Support Services Agency) moved to establish a judgment for support arrearages pursuant to this section, the agency did not initiate a new action to establish the noncustodial parent’s liability. Rather, the child support enforcement division (now the Child Support Services Agency) sought to collect a valid, unsatisfied domestic judgment, which it already possessed, for a specified sum of money. In this sense, although termed a motion requesting establishment of a judgment under this section, each proceeding was in aid of enforcement of a judgment already in existence.

      <p>
       Where the noncustodial parent was apparently available to testify by telephone and given the desirability of allowing him a meaningful opportunity to present his defenses in custodial parent’s motion for past due child support, the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to allow the noncustodial parent to testify, though he did not file a motion under Civil Rule 99 to participate telephonically. In a proceeding to collect past due child support, some procedural safeguards are reasonably eased to ensure that the child’s welfare is protected. Carvalho v. Carvalho, 838 P.2d 259 (Alaska 1992).

       Arrearages were improperly accumulated against the presumptive father where he was not accorded due process of law by CSED (CSSA) when it entered a child support order and established child support arrears against him without giving him notice and an opportunity to rebut the presumption of paternity.

      <p>
       The superior court lacked authority to condition execution of judgment on a valid grant for child support arrearages. Department of Revenue, Child Support Enforcement Div. v. Demers, 915 P.2d 1219 (Alaska 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the mother filed a motion requesting establishment of a judgment, and an affidavit stating that more than one payment of child support was over 30 days past due, she complied with statutory requirements. Despite the unusual circumstances surrounding father’s incurring the arrearages, being deployed abroad and not being given a sum certain until return from deployment, Alaska law is clear, and judgment for the amount owed was mandatory.

       The agency shall compile and maintain a list of obligors who are not in substantial compliance with a support order or payment schedule negotiated under (g)(1) of this section. The agency may not include an obligor on the list unless the agency has sent to the obligor, at the obligor’s most recent address on file with the agency, written notice of the arrearages at least 60 days before placement on the list. The list must include the names, social security numbers, dates of birth, and last known addresses of the persons. The list shall be updated by the agency on a monthly basis.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c27s25.27.244ol1b">
       The agency shall, on a monthly basis, provide a copy of the list to each licensing entity through a computer readable magnetic medium. A licensing entity subject to this section shall implement procedures to accept and process the list. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a licensing entity may not issue or renew a license for a person on the list except as provided in this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c27s25.27.244ol1c">
       Promptly after receiving an application from an applicant and before issuing or renewing a license, a licensing entity, other than one issuing commercial crewmember fishing licenses, shall determine whether the applicant is on the most recent list provided by the agency. If the applicant is on the list, the licensing entity shall immediately serve notice under (e) of this section of the licensing entity’s intent to withhold issuance or renewal of the license. The notice shall be considered given when delivered personally to the applicant or deposited in the United States mail addressed to the applicant’s last known mailing address on file with the licensing entity.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c27s25.27.244ol1d">
       Other than for a commercial crewmember fishing license, a licensing entity shall issue a temporary license valid for a period of 150 days to an applicant whose name is on the list if the applicant is otherwise eligible for a license. The temporary license may not be extended. Only one temporary license may be issued during a regular license term and its validity shall coincide with the first 150 days of that license term. A license for the full or remainder of the license term may be issued or renewed only upon compliance with this section. If a license or application is denied under this section, money paid by the applicant or licensee shall be refunded by the licensing entity after retention of the temporary license fee, if any.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c27s25.27.244ol1e">
       Notices for use under (c) and (r) of this section shall be developed by each licensing entity under guidelines provided by the agency and are subject to approval by the agency. The notice must include the address and telephone number of the agency and shall emphasize the necessity of obtaining a release from the agency as a condition for the issuance or renewal of a license. The notice must inform an applicant whose license is governed by (d) of this section that the licensing entity shall issue a temporary license for 150 calendar days under (d) of this section if the applicant is otherwise eligible and that, upon expiration of that time period, the license will be denied unless the licensing entity has received a release from the agency. The agency shall also develop a form that the applicant may use to request a review by the agency. A copy of this form shall be included with each notice sent under (c) or (r) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c27s25.27.244ol1f">
       The agency shall establish review procedures consistent with this section to allow an applicant to have the underlying arrearages and relevant defenses investigated, to provide an applicant information on the process of obtaining a modification of a support order, or to provide an applicant assistance in the establishment of a payment schedule on arrearages if the circumstances warrant.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c27s25.27.244ol1g">
       If the applicant wishes to challenge being included on the list, the applicant shall submit to the agency a written request for review within 30 days after receiving the notice under (c) or (r) of this section by using the form developed under (e) of this section. Within 30 days after receiving a written request for review, the agency shall inform the applicant in writing of the agency’s findings. The agency shall immediately send a release to the appropriate licensing entity and the applicant if any of the following conditions is met:
       <ol>
        <li id="t25c27s25.27.244ol1g1">
         the applicant is found to be in substantial compliance with each support order applicable to the applicant or has negotiated an agreement with the agency for a payment schedule on arrearages and is in substantial compliance with the negotiated agreement; if the applicant fails to be in substantial compliance with an agreement negotiated under this paragraph, the agency shall send to the appropriate licensing entity a revocation of any release previously sent to the entity for that applicant;
        </li>
        <li id="t25c27s25.27.244ol1g2">
         the applicant has submitted a timely request for review to the agency, but the agency will be unable to complete the review and send notice of findings to the applicant in sufficient time for the applicant to file a timely request for judicial relief within the 150-day period during which the applicant’s temporary license is valid under (d) of this section; this paragraph applies only if the delay in completing the review process is not the result of the applicant’s failure to act in a reasonable, timely, and diligent manner upon receiving notice from the licensing entity that the applicant’s name is on the list;
        </li>
        <li id="t25c27s25.27.244ol1g3">
         the applicant has, within 30 days after receiving the agency’s findings following a request for review under (2) of this subsection, filed and served a request for judicial relief under this section, but a resolution of that relief will not be made within the 150-day period of the temporary license under (d) of this section; this paragraph applies only if the delay in completing the judicial relief process is not the result of the applicant’s failure to act in a reasonable, timely, and diligent manner upon receiving the agency’s notice of findings; or

       An applicant is required to act with diligence in responding to notices from the licensing entity and the agency with the recognition that the temporary license granted under (d) of this section will lapse after 150 days and that the agency and, where appropriate, the court must have time to act within that 150-day period. An applicant’s delay in acting, without good cause, that directly results in the inability of the agency to complete a review of the applicant’s request or the court to hear the request for judicial relief within the required period does not constitute the diligence required under this section that would justify the issuance of a release.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c27s25.27.244ol1i">
       Except as otherwise provided in this section, the agency may not issue a release if the applicant is not in substantial compliance with the order for support or with an agreement negotiated under (g)(1) of this section. The agency shall notify the applicant in writing that the applicant may request any or all of the following: (1) judicial relief from the agency’s decision not to issue a release or the agency’s decision to revoke a release under (g)(1) of this section; (2) a judicial determination of substantial compliance; (3) a modification of the support order. The notice must also contain the name and address of the court in which the applicant may file the request for relief and inform the applicant that the applicant’s name shall remain on the list if the applicant does not request judicial relief within 30 days after receiving the notice. The applicant shall comply with all statutes and rules of court implementing this section. This section does not limit an applicant’s authority under other law to request an order to show cause or notice of motion to modify a support order or to fix a payment schedule on arrearages accruing under a support order or to obtain a court finding of substantial compliance with a support order or a court finding of compliance with subpoenas and warrants described in (a) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c27s25.27.244ol1j">
       A request for judicial relief from the agency’s decision must state the grounds on which relief is requested, and the judicial action shall be limited to those stated grounds. Judicial relief under this subsection is not an appeal and shall be governed by court rules adopted to implement this section. Unless otherwise provided by court rule, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing within 20 calendar days after the filing of service on the opposing party. The court’s decision shall be limited to a determination of each of the following issues, as applicable:
       <ol>
        <li id="t25c27s25.27.244ol1j1">
         whether there is a support order or a payment schedule on arrearages;

      <li id="t25c27s25.27.244ol1k">

       If an applicant is in substantial compliance with a support order or payment schedule, the agency shall mail to the applicant and the appropriate licensing entity a release stating that the applicant is in substantial compliance. The receipt of a release shall serve to notify the applicant and the licensing entity that, for the purposes of this section, the applicant is in substantial compliance with the support order or payment schedule unless the agency, under (a) of this section, certifies subsequent to the issuance of a release that the applicant is once again not in substantial compliance with a support order or payment schedule.

       The agency may enter into interagency agreements with the state agencies that have responsibility for the administration of licensing entities as necessary to implement this section to the extent that it is cost effective to implement the interagency agreements. The agreements shall provide for the receipt by the other state agencies and licensing entities of federal money to cover that portion of costs allowable in federal law and regulation and incurred by the state agencies and licensing entities in implementing this section.

       Sec. 25.27.246.
       Adverse action against delinquent obligor’s driver’s license.

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t25c27s25.27.246ol1a">
       The agency shall compile and maintain a list of obligors who have a driver’s license, and either (1) are not in substantial compliance with a support order, or (2) whose names are required to be placed on the list under (p)(2) of this section. The agency may not include an obligor on the list unless the agency has sent to the obligor, at the obligor’s most recent address on file with the agency, written notice of the arrearages at least 60 days before placement on the list. The list must include the names, social security numbers, dates of birth, and last known addresses of the persons. The list shall be updated by the agency on a monthly basis.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c27s25.27.246ol1b">
       The agency shall serve notice under (d) of this section to each person on the list that the person’s driver’s license will be suspended in 150 days, and will not be reissued or renewed the next time it is applied for if the person’s name is on the list at the time of the subsequent application, unless the licensee receives a release from the agency. The notice shall be considered given when delivered personally to the person or deposited in the United States mail addressed to the person’s last known mailing address on file with the agency.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c27s25.27.246ol1c">
       If the licensee fails to obtain a release during the 150-day period following notice under (b) and (d) of this section or if the agency revokes a release of a person’s license under (n) or (o) of this section, the agency shall notify the department that the licensee’s driver’s license should be suspended and further renewals or applications should be denied until the agency sends the department a release for the licensee. Upon receiving the agency’s notice under this subsection, the department shall suspend the licensee’s driver’s license and may not issue or renew a driver’s license for the licensee until the department receives a release to do so from the agency. If a license is suspended or an application is denied under this section, money paid by the applicant or licensee may not be refunded by the department.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c27s25.27.246ol1d">
       The notice under (b) of this section must include the address and telephone number of the agency and shall emphasize the necessity of obtaining a release from the agency as a condition for avoiding suspension or denial of the person’s driver’s license. The notice must also inform the licensee that, if a license is suspended or an application is denied under this section, money paid by the licensee will not be refunded by the department. The agency shall also develop a form that the licensee may use to request a review by the agency. A copy of this form shall be included with each notice sent under (b) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c27s25.27.246ol1e">
       The agency shall establish review procedures consistent with this section to allow a licensee to have the underlying arrearages and relevant defenses investigated, to provide a licensee with information on the process of obtaining a modification of a support order, or to provide a licensee with assistance in the establishment of a payment schedule on arrearages if the circumstances warrant.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c27s25.27.246ol1f">
       If a licensee wishes to challenge being included on the list, the licensee shall submit to the agency a written request for review within 30 days after the notice under (b) of this section was personally delivered or postmarked by using the form developed under (d) of this section. Within 30 days after receiving a written request for review, the agency shall inform the licensee in writing of the agency’s findings. The agency shall immediately send a release to the department and the licensee if any of the following conditions is met:
       <ol>
        <li id="t25c27s25.27.246ol1f1">
         the licensee is found to be in substantial compliance with each support order applicable to the licensee or has negotiated an agreement with the agency for a payment schedule on arrearages and is in substantial compliance with the negotiated agreement;
        </li>
        <li id="t25c27s25.27.246ol1f2">
         the licensee has submitted a timely request for review to the agency, but the agency will be unable to complete the review and send notice of findings to the licensee in sufficient time for the licensee to file a timely request for judicial relief within the 150-day period before the licensee’s license will be suspended under (c) of this section; this paragraph applies only if the delay in completing the review process is not the result of the licensee’s failure to act in a reasonable, timely, and diligent manner upon receiving notice from the agency that the licensee’s driver’s license will be suspended in 150 days;
        </li>
        <li id="t25c27s25.27.246ol1f3">
         the licensee has, within 30 days after receiving the agency’s findings following a request for review under (2) of this subsection, filed and served a request for judicial relief under this section, but a resolution of that relief will not be made within the 150-day period before license suspension under (c) of this section; this paragraph applies only if the delay in completing the judicial relief process is not the result of the licensee’s failure to act in a reasonable, timely, and diligent manner upon receiving the agency’s notice of findings; or
        </li>
        <li id="t25c27s25.27.246ol1f4">

       A licensee is required to act with diligence in responding to notices from the agency with the recognition that the person’s driver’s license will be suspended after 150 days or that a subsequent license will not be issued and that the agency and, where appropriate, the court must have time to act within that 150-day period or before the subsequent license is needed, as applicable. A licensee’s delay in acting, without good cause, that directly results in the inability of the agency to complete a review of the licensee’s request or the court to hear the request for judicial relief within the required period does not constitute the diligence required under this section that would justify the issuance of a release.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c27s25.27.246ol1h">
       If the agency refuses to release the license under (f) of this section or the agency revokes a release under (n) or (o) of this section, the agency shall notify the licensee in writing that the licensee may request any or all of the following: (1) judicial relief from the agency’s decision not to issue a release or the agency’s decision to revoke a release under (n) or (o) of this section; (2) a judicial determination of substantial compliance; (3) a modification of the support order. The notice must also contain the name and address of the court in which the licensee may file the request for relief. The licensee shall comply with all statutes and rules of court implementing this section. This section does not limit a licensee’s authority under other law to request an order to show cause or notice of motion to modify a support order or to fix a payment schedule on arrearages accruing under a support order or to obtain a court finding of substantial compliance with a support order.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c27s25.27.246ol1i">
       A request for judicial relief from the agency’s decision not to issue a release under (f) of this section or from the agency’s decision to revoke a release under (n) or (o) of this section must state the grounds on which relief is requested, and the judicial action shall be limited to those stated grounds. Judicial relief under this subsection is not an appeal and shall be governed by court rules adopted to implement this section. Unless otherwise provided by court rule, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing within 20 calendar days after the filing of service on the opposing party. The court’s decision shall be limited to a determination of each of the following issues, as applicable:
       <ol>
        <li id="t25c27s25.27.246ol1i1">
         whether there is a support order or a payment schedule on arrearages;

       If a licensee is in substantial compliance with a support order or payment schedule, the agency shall mail to the licensee and the department a release stating that the licensee is in substantial compliance. The receipt of a release shall serve to notify the licensee and the department that, for the purposes of this section, the licensee is in substantial compliance with the support order or payment schedule unless the agency

       This section would be unconstitutional as applied, in violation of Alaska’s equal protection clause, if used to revoke the license of an individual incapable of paying the demanded support; the Child Support Enforcement Division (now the Child Support Services Agency) may not require, in payment-schedule negotiations, payments beyond the “best efforts” of the obligor.

       Subsection (i) cannot be applied to prevent a litigant from seeking judicial relief based on inability to pay; with that limitation, subsection (i) passes constitutional muster against the claim that it violates due process.

Nothing contained in this section supersedes the provisions of AS 45.01 — AS 45.08, AS 45.12, AS 45.14, and AS 45.29 (Uniform Commercial Code).

       Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, AS Title 25, Chapter 30, is consistent with the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, 28 U.S.C.S. § 1738A, and grants exclusive jurisdiction over child custody matters to the home state or recent home state.

       CINA statutes govern proceedings relating to minors who are residents of Alaska regardless of whether the minor is physically present in Alaska, and the superior court’s findings that the boys retained their Alaska residency were not clearly erroneous where the mother’s only relevant evidence was her own testimony that she had gone to Edmonton, Canada with an intent to remain there. E.H. v. Dep't of Health &amp; Soc. Servs., 23 P.3d 1186 (Alaska 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska court properly retained Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act jurisdiction when the parties moved to other jurisdictions because (1) the court had initial jurisdiction, and (2) an inconvenient forum analysis did not require a transfer, which would cause a significant delay for the parties to obtain new counsel and a new court to become familiar with the case.

       Because the child’s father filed his Alaska custody petition six months and a few days after his child left Alaska for California to visit his maternal grandmother, and since the child’s absence from Alaska was not initially intended to be permanent, Alaska was the child’s home state within six months of start of custody case. Consequently, Alaska courts had jurisdiction to hear the custody petition. Atkins v. Vigil, 59 P.3d 255 (Alaska 2002).

       Record showed that the child lived in Alaska when the mother filed her complaint for custody and that the child had lived in Alaska for approximately six years before the filing date; the superior court therefore had subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute. Barlow v. Thompson, 221 P.3d 998 (Alaska 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a child custody case, a superior court had jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act to hear and decide the case because Alaska was the home state of the children when their father commenced the action; the children lived in Alaska for exactly six months, and a mother did not appeal a decision from another state that vacated an earlier permanent restraining order, which had granted the mother custody. Yelena R. v. George R., 326 P.3d 989 (Alaska 2014).

      <p>
       Superior court properly concluded that the father did not have a home state at the time he filed a divorce action where the majority of the evidence showed that the couple’s move to Mississippi was a permanent move, and thus, Alaska was not his home state, and the father had not lived in Mississippi for six months prior to filing the action. Norris v. Norris, 345 P.3d 924 (Alaska 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over a mother’s request for a divorce and child custody where at the time the father filed the Mississippi divorce action, the child and both his parents lived in Mississippi, the child had extended family in Mississippi, whom he saw regularly, he had a primary doctor and a daycare center that he attended, and he had a friend he played with and other children and adults he associated with at summer school. Norris v. Norris, 345 P.3d 924 (Alaska 2015).

       Trial court properly exercised its jurisdiction when it determined child custody, as the wife and the child moved to Alaska more than six months before the proceedings began.

       Even if Alaska did not have jurisdiction as the children’s home state, the superior court would still retain jurisdiction under former AS 25.30.020(a)(2) because the boys were present in Alaska and in need of aid on the day the state filed its petition for temporary custody.

       Superior court properly denied the divorced father’s request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the mother from leaving Alaska with their children; the father did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of his claim because Alaska law did not require a custodial parent to obtain permission from the non-custodial parent before moving out of state. The father still had the option of filing a motion to modify custody based on the change in circumstances because the superior court retained jurisdiction over the parties and their children despite the mother’s move.

       In a case where the father asked an Alaska court to modify an Ohio court’s order with respect to visitation of his children, superior court lacked jurisdiction to modify the orders under this section because the Ohio court had not relinquished exclusive jurisdiction and because the father still resided in Ohio. Robertson v. Riplett, 194 P.3d 382 (Alaska 2008).

       The decision to decline jurisdiction if the court is an inconvenient forum is a discretionary one. Szmyd v. Szmyd, 641 P.2d 14 (Alaska 1982) (decided under former AS 25.30.060).

       It is error for a court to deny an inconvenient forum motion brought under this section without articulating its reasoning. Szmyd v. Szmyd, 641 P.2d 14 (Alaska 1982) (decided under former AS 25.30.060).

        Factors in determining forum non conveniens. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not abuse discretion in granting mother’s motion to decline jurisdiction on the basis of forum non conveniens under paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(4), and (b)(6); although the child had resided in Alaska for a year when the father petitioned for custody, she had spent most of her life residing in either Arizona or New Mexico, evidence established that the father was in a superior financial position where he was able to retain his own counsel and the mother was represented by legal aid in New Mexico, and members of the mother’s and father’s families lived in New Mexico and were to be called as witnesses in determining the custody issue. Mikesell v. Waterman, 197 P.3d 184 (Alaska 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not an abuse of discretion for a trial court which had entered an initial custody order to decline to cede jurisdiction over a visitation dispute to a Tennessee court on forum non conveniens grounds because it was apparent from the record that the trial court considered the relevant statutory factor. Steven D. v. Nicole J., 308 P.3d 875 (Alaska 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court should not have ceded its jurisdiction to Texas based on a finding that evidence about the children's current status was located there; trial court minimized the importance of protecting the children from the father's alleged domestic violence and the evidence required to resolve domestic violence and Indian Child Welfare Act issues. Inter alia, Alaska law had a presumption against awarding custody to a parent who was the perpetrator of domestic violence, and evidence relating to social and cultural standards, as well as testimony from a qualified expert, was located in Alaska. Rice v. McDonald, 390 P.3d 1133 (Alaska 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska court properly retained Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act jurisdiction when the parties moved to other jurisdictions because (1) the court had initial jurisdiction, and (2) an inconvenient forum analysis did not require a transfer, which would cause a significant delay for the parties to obtain new counsel and a new court to become familiar with the case. Roman v. Karren, 461 P.3d 1252 (Alaska 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Consideration of timing of motion. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not improper for a court to consider the timing of an inconvenient forum motion as it considers the location of necessary evidence, where a party waited until the day of trial to raise inconvenient forum concerns, and that party, the children, and an expert witness had flown to Alaska for the trial. Pinneo v. Pinneo, 835 P.2d 1233 (Alaska 1992) (decided under former AS 25.30.060).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Designation of state that will assume jurisdiction. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       When a court declines to exercise its jurisdiction by its own motion, it must designate a specific state which will assume jurisdiction. Waller v. Richardson, 757 P.2d 1036 (Alaska 1988) (decided under former AS 25.30.060).

       In ruling on inconvenient forum motion, it is not the state that has accumulated a longer duration of contact with the child which is dispositive; rather, the inquiry must be into which state has the closer connection with the child.

       Assigning too much weight to the location of evidence of the custodial parent’s changed circumstances was an abuse of discretion, where the child had been living in Alaska with the noncustodial parent for over seven months just prior to commencement of the proceedings and had expressed a desire to have custody changed.

       Where Alaska was the child’s home state when the child custody proceeding was commenced, and every relevant statutory factor pointed to Alaska as the most convenient forum, the superior court erred in basing its decision to decline jurisdiction exclusively on which party it felt would be more inconvenienced by the requisite travel to a non-local forum. Rogers v. Rogers, 907 P.2d 469 (Alaska 1995) (decided under former AS 25.30.060).

        For conduct to be wrongful or similarly reprehensible,
       </b>
       it is not necessary that a child be taken in violation of an outstanding order or decree, nor is it a defense that no order or decree has been entered.
       It is sufficient when the conduct is “so objectionable that a court cannot in good conscience permit the party access to its jurisdiction.” Stokes v. Stokes, 751 P.2d 1363 (Alaska 1988) (decided under former AS 25.30.070).
      </p>

       <b>
        The same reprehensibility standard applies to situations governed by subsections (a) and (b);
       </b>
       thus, the standard as set forth in Stokes v. Stokes, 751 P.2d 1363 (Alaska 1988), applied in a proceeding for modification of custody decree of another state. Jones v. Jones, 925 P.2d 1339 (Alaska 1996) (decided under former AS 25.30.070).

        Father did not “wrongfully” transport the children
       </b>
       from Washington to Virginia where custody proceedings were not instituted until after he had returned to Virginia; at the time he left Washington with the children no court had taken jurisdiction over the dispute and both parents were equally entitled to custody.

        Time for motion for attorney’s fees. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A party moving for attorney’s fees under subsection (c) was required to file a motion within ten days following the trial court’s final disposition of the controlling custody issue, unless the trial court granted additional time. Jones v. Jones, 925 P.2d 1339 (Alaska 1996) (decided under former AS 25.30.070).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though it was filed more than two months after the disposition of the underlying custody issue, the court did not abuse its discretion in considering a motion for attorney’s fees to have been timely where, at the time, custody cases could reasonably be construed as exempt from former Civil Rule 82 which required filing within ten days, and where the custody order had provided that the mother could “move for costs and attorney’s fees.” Jones v. Jones, 925 P.2d 1339 (Alaska 1996) (decided under former AS 25.30.070).

       Award of full attorney’s fees to the nonpetitioning party requires court findings that petitioner’s conduct was reprehensible from the time the Alaska proceedings were commenced. Kimmons v. Heldt, 667 P.2d 1245 (Alaska 1983) (decided under former AS 25.30.070).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court’s finding that the father “wrongfully withheld/retained the children after a visitation” was sufficient to support an award of attorney’s fees to the mother. Jones v. Jones, 925 P.2d 1339 (Alaska 1996) (decided under former AS 25.30.070).

       Where the child’s mother agreed to make her son’s absence from Alaska permanent, rather than merely visitation with the child’s maternal grandmother, only after the son had been in California for a significant period of time, the trial court was required to include the temporary absence time period in assessing whether the son lived in Alaska within six months of the commencement of the father’s child custody proceeding in Alaska.

       Trial court did not err in finding a water-throwing incident between husband and wife did not constitute an act of domestic violence because the wife admitted that the husband had not inflicted serious bodily injury. Parks v. Parks, 214 P.3d 295 (Alaska 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court’s reluctance to weigh an incident of domestic violence between a father and his girlfriend in its best interests analysis was based on several legal errors because the superior court downplayed the incident due to a lack of evidence that an assault occurred; because both the father and the girlfriend suffered some minor injury during the altercation, the evidence could support a finding that an assault occurred regardless of whether either of them feared injury. Harris v. Governale, 311 P.3d 1052 (Alaska 2013).
