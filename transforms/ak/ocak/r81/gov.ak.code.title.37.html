      Each state agency that makes or purchases a loan shall prepare an annual report of the aggregate of all loans, by type, made or purchased by the state agency during the preceding fiscal year. The report must include the estimated rate of interest that would have been charged if the loan had been made or purchased at prevailing market rates and must include the difference between the return on the loan that would have been realized under that estimated rate of interest and the return on the loans under the interest rate actually charged. In the absence of a prevailing market rate in the state, the state agency shall use a rate that, in the judgment of the agency, is comparable to a prevailing market rate. The report must also include an analysis of the income groups benefited under the loan programs. By January 30 of each year the state agency shall notify the legislature that the report prepared under this section is available.

Pursuant to both provisions, a state official may not enter into an unqualified indemnification agreement in the absence of an existing appropriation to cover the potential payment that may be required of the state. However, in some instances, unique commercial realities might compel some accommodation for requests for indemnification.
      In such cases, the state may agree to indemnify, if the indemnification agreement (1) clearly explains that the decision of whether to appropriate funds necessary to pay the liability is within the unfettered discretion of the legislature, and (2) is entered only with the approval of high level state officials and the concurrence of the attorney general or deputy attorney general. 2005 Alas.

        Municipality has no duty to purchase third party’s property or liability. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A third party owning property that a municipality expressed an interest in buying is at most an incidental beneficiary of any contract between the municipality and the state, assuming, without deciding, that the contractual concept of third party beneficiary rights can apply in the legislative grant situation; there is not a statutory duty for the municipality to purchase the property but discretion to spend or not to spend funds within the parameters set by the legislature; and there is no intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. Ellis v. City of Valdez, 686 P.2d 700 (Alaska 1984).

      Vesting authority in the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee to approve transfers between appropriation items violates the separation of powers doctrine and is an improper delegation of a legislative function to an interim committee. July 22, 1976 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 13(3) of the 1976 budget bill, which authorized the Budget and Audit Committee to supervise the governor’s execution of the budget act, specifically over that portion of it which permitted him to transfer appropriation items, constituted an encroachment on executive power and offended the Alaska Constitution.

       Former paragraph (g)(2) of this section is unconstitutional for two reasons:
       first, because it delegates power over appropriations, a power which can only be exercised by the legislature in accord with the procedures mandated by Alaska Const. art. II; second, because the statute lacks standards to guide the exercise of administrative discretion.
       In either case, the statute violates the principle of separation of powers. State v. Fairbanks N. Star Borough, 736 P.2d 1140 (Alaska 1987).

      <p>
       Paragraph (a)(1) fails to include several funds — including trust receipts, “restricted” accounts within the general fund which require further legislative appropriation before they can be expended, and the permanent fund earnings reserve account — in the “amount available for appropriation” which are in fact available within the meaning of Alaska Const., art. IX, § 17. It therefore does not provide an accurate definition of the constitutional term and is unconstitutional. Hickel v. Cowper, 874 P.2d 922 (Alaska 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph (a)(3) defines the “amount of appropriations made in the previous calendar year for the previous fiscal year” in terms of the unconstitutionally limited number of appropriation sources identified in paragraph (a)(2), which itself relies primarily on the sources identified in paragraph (a)(1); it cannot be severed from these paragraphs and therefore is also unconstitutional. Hickel v. Cowper, 874 P.2d 922 (Alaska 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because subsection (b) fails to consider all amounts which are “available for appropriation” within the meaning of art. IX, § 17 of the state constitution in determining the state’s repayment obligation, it is unconstitutional. Hickel v. Cowper, 874 P.2d 922 (Alaska 1994).

     Section 4, ch. 182, SLA 1978 purported to add an article 2, entitled “University Fund,” to this chapter.
     Section 27 of ch. 182 made that article effective on the date that the Board of Regents voted to approve the matters under consideration as provided in § 24 of the act.
     However, the Board of Regents disapproved all matters on August 17, 1978; consequently, that article 2 did not take effect.

      This fund does not represent an unconstitutional dedication of public funds under § 7, art. IX, of the state constitution, as that section of the constitution contains an implied exception for revenue derived from bond issues and for revenue derived from facilities constructed with bond proceeds, at least to the extent that it is necessary to satisfy the debt obligation or maintain the facility so that it continues to generate revenues for that purpose.

       International airports revenue bond redemption fund.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      There is another special fund of the state, known as the “International Airports Revenue Bond Redemption Fund,” which is a trust fund for paying and securing the payment of the principal of and interest and redemption premium, if any, on the bonds and which shall be at all times completely segregated and set apart from all other funds of the state. The committee, on behalf of the state, shall obligate and bind the state to set aside and pay into the bond redemption fund any part or parts of, or all of, or a fixed proportion of, or a fixed amount of the money in the revenue fund sufficient to pay the principal of and interest and redemption premium, if any, on the bonds as the payments become due and, if it considers it necessary, to set aside and maintain reserves for this purpose.
      The bond redemption fund shall be drawn upon for the purpose of paying the principal of and interest and redemption premium, if any, on the bonds, and the bonds do not constitute a general obligation of the state.

      The toll facilities revenue bond redemption fund is established for deposit in trust of money for paying and securing the payment of principal of and interest and redemption premium, if any, on bonds and is set apart from all other money of the state.
      The committee, on behalf of the state, shall obligate the state to set aside and pay into the bond redemption fund from the revenue fund an amount of money sufficient to pay the principal of and interest and redemption premium, if any, on the bonds as the payments become due and, if the committee considers it necessary, to set aside and maintain a reserve for this purpose.
      The bond redemption fund is drawn upon for the purpose of paying the principal of and interest and redemption premium, if any, on the bonds, and the bonds do not constitute a general obligation of the state.

     Bonds payable subject only to appropriation, such as tax credit bonds proposed in 2018 legislation, can be issued consistent with the requirements of article IX of the Alaska Constitution. Such subject-to-appropriation financing tools are not prohibited; because the payment on the bonds is subject to the legislature's discretion to appropriate funds, and bondholders have no recourse against the state, these bonds are not “state debt”.
