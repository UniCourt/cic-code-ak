    Section 1, ch. 74, SLA 1985 provides:
    “PURPOSE.
    The legislature finds that the municipal code contains many provisions that have created problems for municipalities that must function under AS 29 and that the title is poorly organized and difficult for people to use. Therefore, it is the purpose of the legislature to revise and reorganize the municipal code to permit local government to function more effectively. Except as expressly provided, the legislature does not intend by this Act to alter or affect in any way the relationship or balance of authority between the state and home rule or general law municipalities with respect to the timing or manner of resource development under AS 31, AS 38, or other provisions of law. Except as expressly provided, the legislature does not intend by this Act to increase or reduce the authority of state agencies to carry out their functions under other titles.”

       By requiring that each borough “embrace an area and population with common interests to the maximum extent possible,” Alaska Const. art. X, § 3 necessarily vests the Local Boundary Commission with power to find non-compliance when the boundaries originally described in a petition for incorporation do not maximize common interests. Thus, although subsection (a) requires a preliminary finding of non-compliance before the boundaries of a proposed borough may be altered, the Local Boundary Commission, in passing on the issue of compliance, has broad authority to decide what the most appropriate boundaries of the proposed borough would be. Petitioners for Incorporation of City of Yakutat v. Local Boundary Comm'n, 900 P.2d 721 (Alaska 1995) (decided prior to 1994 amendment).

       A finding of non-compliance under subsection (a) may be made either expressly or by implication. Petitioners for Incorporation of City of Yakutat v. Local Boundary Comm'n, 900 P.2d 721 (Alaska 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the Local Boundary Commission based its decision that the 141st Meridian was the most appropriate boundary for the proposed borough on criteria reflecting the common interests of the area and its population, and because the Local Boundary Commission plainly meant its decision to ensure that the area and population to be included in the approved borough would be maximally cohesive, the decision itself was tantamount to a declaration that the originally proposed boundaries did not comply with the standards for incorporation.

       Given the Alaska Constitution’s mandate that boroughs be cohesive “to the maximum degree possible,” the Local Boundary Commission acted well within the purview of its authority in considering the desirability of future incorporation of neighboring areas such as Prince William Sound and the interests of affected land owners and users such as the Chugach Alaska Corporation.

       Local Boundary Commission properly approved a city’s petition to incorporate a new borough over an existing borough’s objection because the Commission (1) maximized common interests, (2) considered the existing borough’s consolidation and postponement requests, (3) exercised its discretion to not consolidate the petition with the existing borough’s annexation petition, (4) considered the existing borough’s evidence, and (5) did not have to analyze the competing petitions head-to-head, as the Commission’s common-interest finding presupposed thoroughly considering optimal boundaries.

       Those who reside or own property in the area to be annexed have no vested right to insist that annexation take place only with their consent. The subject of expansion of municipal boundaries is legitimately the concern of the state as a whole, and not just that of the local community. Fairview Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1 v.

       The state may permit residents of local communities to determine annexation questions at an election.
       But when this has been done, the state is not irrevocably committed to that arrangement.
       If the citizens of the state, in adopting a constitution, decide that it is in the public interest to establish another election procedure, there is no constitutional obstacle to that course of action.

      A bonded indebtedness or other debt incurred before unification remains the tax obligation of the area that contracted the debt, except that by ordinance the tax obligation may be assumed by a larger area if the governing body determines that the asset for which the bonded indebtedness or other debt was incurred benefited the larger area before unification, or benefits the larger area after unification. However, bonded indebtedness or other debt for sewage collection systems, water distribution systems, and streets, even if determined to be benefiting a larger area than that which incurred the debt, remains the tax obligation of the area that incurred the debt.

      The policy expressed by a full reading of Title 29 is that municipal alterations through such devices as mergers, consolidations, and dissolutions should not be used to arbitrarily enlarge the rights granted in AS 29.65. To permit a municipal alteration to trigger a new entitlement without regard to prior conveyances under AS 29.65 or 38.05.810 would result in certain municipal lands being counted twice in the determination of a municipal entitlement.

     <p>
      Under § 6,
      ch. 100, SLA 2002, paragraph (58) [originally enacted as (62)] is repealed. Under § 9,
      ch. 100, SLA 2002, this repeal is effective only “if a court of competent jurisdiction whose decisions are binding in this state enters a final judgment on the merits that is based on federal law, is no longer subject to appeal or petition for certiorari, and substantially limits or impairs the essential elements of
      4 U.S.C. 116 — 126.” Under § 11,
      ch. 100, SLA 2002, the effective date of the repeal is “the day after the last day on which the judgment described in § 9 . . . could have been appealed.” As of May 2022, this contingency had not occurred.

       As principles of common law: (1) An officeholder cannot at his own will, without respect to the public convenience and public interest, cast aside his responsibilities and duties; (2) resignation of office is not complete until accepted by lawful authority or until the incumbent is relieved by the qualification of his successor.

      <p>
       Assuming the council has the power to accept the resignation of a councilman, it would still be necessary, in order to complete the resignation, that the corporation, by its agents, the council, should manifest its acceptance, either by a formal declaration to that effect, or by the appointment of a successor.

      “Local activity rule”. —

    </p>
    <p>
     The “local activity rule” has been found to be an expedient method for resolving an impasse between state statutes which seek to further a specific policy and municipal ordinances which either directly or collaterally impede this implementation. Conflicts between state statutes and municipal ordinances generally were modulated by ruling in favor of the statutes. Chugach Elec. Ass'n v. Anchorage, 476 P.2d 115 (Alaska 1970).

      Under a former, similar provision, where a proposed incorporation petition provided that public health services should be administered not by the borough assembly but by a board of health which was to be appointed by the borough assembly, but otherwise to operate autonomously in making rules and regulations with the force of law, such rules and regulations would have been illegal ordinances since they would have been promulgated by the board of health rather than by the borough assembly.
      The board of health would have constituted a borough department illegally established by the incorporation petition, and not by ordinance. 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 9.

       Where a public hearing on an ordinance took place, and subsequently the ordinance was amended but the amendments fell squarely within the descriptive summary published in the newspaper as notice of the previous public hearing, no additional hearing was required and failure to publish notice properly concerning a second hearing was legally irrelevant.

       Alaska’s public notice statutes require one public hearing regarding an ordinance, and therefore, if the municipality properly provided notice of the first hearing and the amendments did not alter the basic character of the original proposed ordinance, it was unnecessary to hold a second public hearing, and any deficiency in the notice provided for the second hearing would constitute harmless error.

      To have met the minimum codification requirements of a former, similar provision municipal ordinances should have been topically arranged under a logical and systematic set of chapters and subchapters.
      There should have been a table of contents, an index, and a system of cross-referencing.
      The code, to have been useful, must have had a current supplement which indicated all additions, amendments, and repeals. Periodically the additions and changes noted in the supplement should have been incorporated into the main body of the code. These were minimum requirements. Nothing prevented a municipality from developing a more elaborate and sophisticated code. 1966 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 6.

       This section extends the referendum power to the acts of local governments and similarly does not authorize local legislative authorities to restrict that power. Because many statutes delegate authority specifically to an assembly or other governing body, holding that enactments pursuant to such authority are not subject to referendum would impose a significant and unwarranted restriction on the referendum power.

       Reversal of the denial of the citizen’s application for a petition to recall a member of the city assembly was proper because the clerk applied an inaccurate definition of “misconduct in office” in determining that the application was insufficient; requiring misconduct in office to be criminal would undermine the intent and effectiveness of the recall statutes and would deny the voters’ right to effectively seek recall of their elected officials.

       “Invested capital,” as used in a former, similar provision, meant the initial investment, regardless of subsequent changes in ownership, plus capital additions and minus accrued depreciation. Pichotta v. City of Skagway, 78 F. Supp. 999, 12 Alaska 42 (D. Alaska 1948).

       The term “invested capital” as used in a former, similar provision should not have been construed to mean fair value, nor was the utility entitled to the benefit of any appreciation in value, nor should the term have been construed to mean that which was paid for a utility by the last purchaser.

The municipality may impose an enhanced 911 surcharge within the enhanced 911 service area. An enhanced 911 surcharge may not exceed $2 per month for each wireless telephone number and $2 per month for each local exchange access line for wireline telephones. The maximum surcharge amount of $2 provided for in this subsection may be increased above that level if the surcharge amount is approved by the voters of the enhanced 911 service area. The amount of surcharge imposed for each wireless telephone number must equal the amount imposed for each local exchange access line for a wireline telephone.

The governing body of a municipality shall review an enhanced 911 surcharge annually to determine whether the current level of the surcharge is adequate, excessive, or insufficient to meet anticipated enhanced 911 system needs. When a municipality imposes an enhanced 911 surcharge or the amount of the surcharge is changed, the municipality shall notify in writing the telephone customers subject to the surcharge and provide an explanation of what the surcharge will be used for.

A wireless telephone company that provides telephone service to wireless telephone customers with billing addresses within the enhanced 911 service area shall impose an enhanced 911 surcharge each month and collect the surcharge from customers in the enhanced 911 service area. A local exchange telephone customer may not be subject to more than one enhanced 911 surcharge on a local exchange access line for a wireline telephone. A wireless telephone customer may not be subject to more than one enhanced 911 surcharge for each wireless telephone number.

       Dismissal of property owner's claim that an easement that crossed the owners' property to give access to neighboring residences was an unlawful dedication because the easement was acquired by donation, not dedication, and no further process was required. The law did not require a borough to hold a hearing to consider whether to acquire a right of way and the borough's interpretation of the undefined terms in its ordinance was a reasonable one consistent with the statutory grant of broad authority over planning and land use.

       Challenge to a road service tax was rejected because it was not a special assessment. It was calculated by applying a mill rate to the assessed value of the property; moreover, a borough has authority to tax for road services, and the validity of the tax does not depend upon whether the property owner receives a special benefit. DeVilbiss v. Matanuska-Susitna Borough, 356 P.3d 290 (Alaska 2015).

       Dismissal of property owner's claim that an easement that crossed the owners' property to give access to neighboring residences was an unlawful dedication because the easement was acquired by donation, not dedication, and no further process was required. The law did not require a borough to hold a hearing to consider whether to acquire a right of way and the borough's interpretation of the undefined terms in its ordinance was a reasonable one consistent with the statutory grant of broad authority over planning and land use.

       A person must be “aggrieved” in order to appeal a decision by a zoning board, and a business competitor whose only alleged injury is potential increased competition will be denied standing. Earth Movers v. Fairbanks N. Star Borough, 865 P.2d 741 (Alaska 1993).

        Standing to challenge conditional use permit. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court erred in ruling that a resident lacked standing as a matter of law to challenged a conditional use permit issued to property owners because the resident was a “person aggrieved” under the city code; the potential impact of building into a reduced setback was some evidence that the resident, by virtue of his ownership in the zoning district, could suffer diminished enjoyment of his property.

      </p>
      <p>
       Judicial review of zoning board decisions is narrow and a presumption of validity is accorded those decisions, since zoning board interpretations of zoning ordinances and planning documents should be given great weight and should be accepted whenever there is a reasonable basis for the meaning given by the board.

       In a case involving land classification, both state law and the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, Borough Code allowed a group, which challenged an adjudicatory decision of the Kenai Peninsula Borough Board of Adjustment, to appeal the board’s decision to the superior court; because the group appealed an adjudicatory decision rather than a legislative one, the superior court improperly dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.

        Non-monetary asset transfers are not appropriations subject to the governor’s enhanced veto under Alaska Const., art. II.

Having received the required two-thirds majority, the veto was successfully overridden, and the bill, affecting this section, became law. State Legislative Council v.

       Though the appellant raises a contention about the propriety of a tax assessment, the board of equalization is not required to come forward with evidence to substantiate the assessment, the burden of production not having shifted. North Star Alaska Hous. Corp. v. Fairbanks N. Star Borough Bd. of Equalization, 844 P.2d 1109 (Alaska 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       A taxpayer contesting an assessment need only prove that the valuation is improper. The taxpayer does not have to offer the correct amount, range or method of valuation. The burden then shifts to the taxing authority to introduce credible evidence which substantiates its assessment. Cool Homes v. Fairbanks N. Star Borough, 860 P.2d 1248 (Alaska 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Estate representative failed to meet his burden of proof to show that estate property was overvalued for assessment purposes. The testimony presented to the board of equalization demonstrated the property was valued by comparing it to similar properties in the same area; its deteriorated and partially-completed condition was taken into account. Varilek v. Burke, 254 P.3d 1068 (Alaska 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a taxpayer who challenged a municipal assessor’s valuation of real property based on its deteriorated condition failed to submit cost estimates for renovation, he did not meet his burden of production or persuasion under this section, and the municipal board of equalization reasonably upheld the valuation.

       Since the amount of the tax due had not been determined when the borough initiated foreclosure, due to the remand to the Board of Equalization for reassessment, the amount of its lien had not been established. Interest and penalties could not be determined, since there was no figure on which to base them. The taxpayer’s right of redemption was impaired, because the taxpayer could not ascertain what amount it had to pay to avail itself of the right. Thus, the borough could not foreclose at that time.

       Because the phrase “previous year’s delinquent taxes” contemplates that unpaid taxes from one year will roll over into the next year’s tax liability, a municipality is required to include property on its foreclosure list as long as previously due taxes have not been paid; the year in which the tax liabilities first arose is irrelevant.

      In the event that creation of a tax zone consisting entirely of oil and gas property was proper and was thereby taxed at a higher mill rate than other property in the city under this section because it received different services than those generally provided in the city, the municipality’s collection of the higher tax from Alyeska in 1986 failed to meet the requirement of a rational relationship between the benefits conferred and the costs of the taxpayer in 1986.

      The amendment erroneously omitted from the text the second sentence of (a), which reads “The sales tax may apply to any or all of these sources.” To correct a manifest error in sec. 2, ch. 30, SLA 2005, the text of the note as set out in the conditional amendment retains the omitted sentence.

        Enforceability of proposed referendum. —

      <p>
       Because a proposed referendum to repeal a sales tax on nonprepared food items did not conflict with or exceed the scope of the power granted to the borough assembly by this section to authorize general law cities to collect certain taxes, the referendum would not be unenforceable as a matter of law if passed.

     <p>
      A petition for incorporation of a second class city may request that a sales and use tax proposal be placed on the same ballot.
      The petition must state the proposed tax rate. The petition may request that incorporation be dependent on the passage of the tax proposition. If so, the incorporation proposition fails if the tax fails.

      Special assessments are usually distinguished from general taxation.
      Special assessments are levied for improvements which benefit particular individuals or property and are levied with reference to, and in proportion to, the special benefit conferred.
      General taxes, on the other hand, are imposed for the purpose of raising moneys to be expended for governmental purposes without regard to special benefits conferred on a particular group or class of persons or property. 1966 Op. Att’y Gen. No. 10, decided under former, similar law.

       In addition to existing municipal authority providing for the preservation, protection, and maintenance of historic sites, the local historical district commission, in consultation with the Alaska Historical Commission in the Department of Natural Resources, may establish historical districts within the boundaries of the municipality.

       A historical district shall be a reasonably compact area of historical significance in which two or more structures important in state or national history, and related by physical proximity or historical association, are located. For purposes of this subsection, “structures important in state or national history” means properties recommended by historical district commissions that are listed in the National Register of Historic Places or are characteristic of the Russian-American period before October 18, 1867, the early territorial period before 1930, or early Native heritage, reflecting the indigenous characteristics of Native culture in Alaska. On recommendation of the governing body of a municipality and the Alaska Historical Commission, the Department of Natural Resources may by regulation formulate additional criteria for the establishment of historical districts not inconsistent with this subsection.

     The policy expressed by a full reading of Title 29 is that municipal alterations through such devices as mergers, consolidations, and dissolutions should not be used to arbitrarily enlarge the rights granted in AS 29.65. To permit a municipal alteration to trigger a new entitlement without regard to prior conveyances under AS 29.65 or 38.05.810 would result in certain municipal lands being counted twice in the determination of a municipal entitlement.
