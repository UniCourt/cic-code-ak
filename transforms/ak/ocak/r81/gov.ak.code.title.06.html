      Notice to a bank of an adverse claim to a deposit standing on its books to the credit of a person is ineffective unless the adverse claimant procures a restraining order, injunction or other appropriate process against the bank from a court in a cause where the person to whose credit the deposit stands is made a party or executes to the bank in form and with sureties acceptable to it a bond, indemnifying the bank from any liability, loss, damage, costs and expenses on account of the payment of the adverse claim or the dishonor of the check or other order of the person to whose credit the deposit stands on the books of the bank. This section does not apply where the person to whose credit the deposit stands is a fiduciary for the adverse claimant, and the facts constituting that relationship and the facts showing a reasonable belief on the part of the claimant that the fiduciary is about to misappropriate the deposit are made to appear by the affidavit of the claimant.

       The director and president of a bank seized pursuant to this section could not argue on appeal that the state’s failure to provide a post-seizure hearing violated his due process rights because his underlying substantive claim that the bank’s business was not being conducted in an unsound manner and the state’s seizure was therefore unauthorized was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel as the issue had already been litigated in a related action, adverse to plaintiff, between the plaintiffs and the FDIC.

     <p>
      In providing authority for the establishment of mutual savings banks it is the intent of the legislature to make available the benefits of mutual savings banking, thereby encouraging the practice of thrift and promoting the accumulation of funds for investment to develop the economy. For the accomplishment of these purposes, the legislature intends by this chapter to vest in mutual banks those powers generally possessed by state-chartered mutual savings banks and to grant authority to the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development to define powers and to adopt regulations designed to enable mutual savings banks to perform their functions and to carry out the above purposes, subject to the provisions of AS 06.05 (Alaska Banking Code) that are not inconsistent with this chapter.

The foregoing facts are conditions precedent to the issuance of a license under this chapter. The license permits the applicant to make loans in accordance with this chapter at the location or locations specified in the application. The license remains in full force and effect until it is surrendered by the licensee or revoked or suspended. If the department denies the application, it shall notify the applicant of the denial, bill the applicant for any outstanding expenses incurred by the department during the investigation and return the bond if those expenses have been paid. The department shall approve or deny every application for license within 60 days from the filing of the application with the fees and the approved bond.

Upon filing with the court a certificate indicating the acceptance of the appointment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or its successor, the possession of and title to all the assets, business, and property of the trust company are transferred to that corporation.

      Credit union membership consists of the incorporators and other persons and incorporated and unincorporated organizations, to the extent permitted by regulations adopted by the commissioner, elected to membership. Each member shall subscribe to at least one share of the stock of the credit union and pay the initial installment on the stock and a uniform entrance fee if required by the board of directors of the credit union.
      Credit union membership is limited to groups having a common bond of occupation or association, or to groups within a well-defined neighborhood, community, or rural district. Shares may be issued in joint tenancy with right of survivorship with a person designated by the credit union member.
      A joint tenant may not be permitted to vote, obtain loans, or hold office, unless the joint tenant is within the field of membership and is qualified for membership.
