The non-network option may require that a covered person pay a higher deductible, copayment, or premium for the plan if the higher deductible, copayment, or premium results from increased costs caused by the use of a non-network provider.

       Reserve adequacy must be determined by a prospective gross premium valuation. For policies in force, in a claims status, or in a continuation of benefits status on the valuation date, the gross premium valuation must take into account the present value of all expected benefits unpaid, all expected expenses unpaid, and all unearned or expected premiums, including expected future premium increases.

If a reserve inadequacy is determined to exist, the loss must be immediately recognized and reserves increased to account for the inadequacy. The increased reserves will be considered minimum reserves.

        No private cause of action.

       — Superior court properly granted an insurer's motion to dismiss an action filed by the victim of a three-car hit-and-run accident for failure to state a claim and denied his subsequent motion for reconsideration because, while the insurer acknowledged that it insured the vehicle owned by the first driver, Alaska law precluded a plaintiff from bringing suit directly against an alleged tortfeasor's insurer for bad faith and could not sue an alleged tortfeasor's insurer directly for the alleged negligence of its insured; the subject statute, in particular, prohibits acts committed so frequently as to become a trade practice, and did not readily lend itself to enforcement by a private cause of action arising from a single claim.

       In an insurance coverage lawsuit, the trial court properly denied the insured’s motion for partial summary judgment against an insurance company and an insurance agent on the issue of coverage; although the insured alleged that the agent was negligent in failing to use reasonable efforts to obtain the insured’s “last known address,” and that the insurance company’s attempts to cancel his policy for non-payment of the renewal premium were ineffective, there was a genuine dispute as to whether the insured gave the agent his new address.

       If an insurer writing personal insurance uses credit information in underwriting or rating a consumer, the insurer shall disclose, either on the insurance application or at the time the insurance application is taken, and at the time of renewal, that the insurer will obtain credit information in connection with the application or renewal. The disclosure required under this subsection shall be in writing or in the same medium as the application for insurance or the notice of renewal. Use of the following statement constitutes compliance with this subsection: “In connection with this application for insurance or notice of renewal, we will review your credit report or obtain or use a credit-based insurance score based on the information contained in your credit report. We may use this information to decide whether to insure you or how much to charge.” If an insurer uses a third party to calculate the consumer’s insurance score, the disclosure required under this subsection must also contain language similar to: “We may use a third party in connection with the development of your insurance score.”

      Suit to recover the profit may be instituted at law or in equity in the superior court by the company, or by the owner of a security of the company in the name and in behalf of the company if the company fails or refuses to bring a suit within 60 days after request or fails diligently to prosecute the suit.

      Contractual duty to defend. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     An insurer cannot escape its contractual duty to defend its insured merely by choosing to accept a version of the facts or an interpretation of the policy which it finds most favorable. Where a resident’s complaint against the insured landlord alleged a claim potentially within the policy coverage, the insurer was precluded as a matter of law from looking to extrinsic facts to escape its duty to defend the insured against the residents’ claims.

      </p>
      <p>
       Expert testimony establishing that an insured’s misrepresentation regarding full-time residence was material to the risk of insuring that residence entitled the insurer to rescind the binder ab initio and deny coverage for a fire at that location. Bennett v. Hedglin, 995 P.2d 668 (Alaska 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this section generally permits rescission of insurance policies due to misrepresentation, the text of the statute does not show it to specifically apply to statutorily-mandated insurance policies covering underground storage tanks; therefore, Environmental Protection Agency regulations, which Alaska had expressly adopted in its own state regulations, provided the exclusive remedy of prospective cancellation of a UST insurance policy in the event of an insured’s misrepresentation and the EPA specifically precluded the remedy of recission in its regulations.

       Alaska law requires the terms of an insurance policy to be interpreted in an ordinary and popular sense as would a man of average intelligence and experience. MAPCO Alaska Petro., Inc. v. Central Nat'l Ins. Co., 784 F. Supp. 1454 (D. Alaska 1991).

        Insurance policies are to be looked upon as contracts of adhesion
       </b>
       for the purpose of determining the rights of the parties thereto.
       In so construing a policy the supreme court does not require as a condition precedent that ambiguities be found in the policy language.
       All that is required is that the parties be of such disproportionate bargaining power that the insured could not have negotiated for variations in the terms of the standard policy.
       Thus, the finding that a policy is a contract of adhesion depends not upon its language, but upon the relationship of the parties.
       The result of such a finding is that the policy is construed so as to provide that coverage which a layman would reasonably have expected given his lay interpretation of the policy’s terms. Continental Ins. Co. v. Bussell, 498 P.2d 706 (Alaska 1972).

      <ol>
       <li id="t21c42a03s21.42.700-VIIol11">
        Rulemaking Authority. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules, including Uniform Standards, and Operating Procedures in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this Compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this Act, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect.
       </li>
       <li id="t21c42a03s21.42.700-VIIol12">
        Rulemaking Procedure. Rules and Operating Procedures shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 1981 as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the Commission. Before the Commission adopts a Uniform Standard, the Commission shall give written notice to the relevant state legislative committee(s) in each Compacting State responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the Uniform Standard. The Commission in adopting a Uniform Standard shall consider fully all submitted materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.
       </li>
       <li id="t21c42a03s21.42.700-VIIol13">
        Effective Date and Opt Out of a Uniform Standard. A Uniform Standard shall become effective ninety (90) days after its promulgation by the Commission or such later date as the Commission may determine; provided, however, that a Compacting State may opt out of a Uniform Standard as provided in this Article. “Opt out” shall be defined as any action by a Compacting State to decline to adopt or participate in a promulgated Uniform Standard. All other Rules and Operating Procedures, and amendments thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each Rule, Operating Procedure or amendment.
       </li>
       <li id="t21c42a03s21.42.700-VIIol14">
        Opt Out Procedure. A Compacting State may opt out of a Uniform Standard, either by legislation or regulation duly promulgated by the Insurance Department under the Compacting State’s Administrative Procedure Act. If a Compacting State elects to opt out of a Uniform Standard by regulation, it must (a) give written notice to the Commission no later than ten (10) business days after the Uniform Standard is promulgated, or at the time the State becomes a Compacting State and (b) find that the Uniform Standard does not provide reasonable protections to the citizens of the State, given the conditions in the State. The Commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the State which warrant a departure from the Uniform Standard and determining that the Uniform Standard would not reasonably protect the citizens of the State. The Commissioner must consider and balance the following factors and find that the conditions in the State and needs of the citizens of the State outweigh: (i) the intent of the legislature to participate in, and the benefits of, an interstate agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the Products subject to this Act; and (ii) the presumption that a Uniform Standard adopted by the Commission provides reasonable protections to consumers of the relevant Product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Compacting State may, at the time of its enactment of this Compact, prospectively opt out of all Uniform Standards involving long-term care insurance products by expressly providing for such opt out in the enacted Compact, and such an opt out shall not be treated as a material variance in the offer or acceptance of any State to participate in this Compact. Such an opt out shall be effective at the time of enactment of this Compact by the Compacting State and shall apply to all existing Uniform Standards involving long-term care insurance products and those subsequently promulgated.
       </li>
       <li id="t21c42a03s21.42.700-VIIol15">

If a Compacting State elects to opt out of a Uniform Standard, the Uniform Standard shall remain applicable in the Compacting State electing to opt out until such time the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the regulation opting out becomes effective. Once the opt out of a Uniform Standard by a Compacting State becomes effective as provided under the laws of that State, the Uniform Standard shall have no further force and effect in that State unless and until the legislation or regulation implementing the opt out is repealed or otherwise becomes ineffective under the laws of the State. If a Compacting State opts out of a Uniform Standard after the Uniform Standard has been made effective in that State, the opt out shall have the same prospective effect as provided under Article XIV for withdrawals.

        Stay of Uniform Standard.

The Commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable manner and there is a likelihood of success. If a stay is granted or extended by the Commission, the stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to ninety (90) days, unless affirmatively extended by the Commission; provided, a stay may not be permitted to remain in effect for more than one (1) year unless the Compacting State can show extraordinary circumstances which warrant a continuance of the stay, including, but not limited to, the existence of a legal challenge which prevents the Compacting State from opting out. A stay may be terminated by the Commission upon notice that the rulemaking process has been terminated.

The court shall give deference to the actions of the Commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the Rule or Operating Procedure to be unlawful if the Rule or Operating Procedure represents a reasonable exercise of the Commission’s authority.

       A policy issued on or after July 1, 1982, must have a provision specifying an interest rate on a policy loan not to exceed eight percent a year, or a provision permitting an adjustable maximum interest rate established under this subsection.  An adjustable maximum rate of interest on a policy loan determined under this subsection may not exceed the higher of the published monthly average for the calendar month ending two months before the date on which the rate is determined, or the rate used to compute cash surrender values under the policy during the applicable period plus one-twelfth of a percentage point multiplied by the number of months in the applicable period.  If an adjustable maximum rate of interest is used in a policy under this subsection, the policy must contain a provision that states times for the adjustment of the interest rate for that policy.  Adjustment shall occur at least once every 12 months, but not more often than once every three months.  The interest rate being charged may be increased if the published monthly average increases by one-half percent or more and the interest rate being charged must be reduced if the published monthly average decreases by one-half percent or more.  A life insurer shall (1) notify the policyholder of the initial rate of interest on the loan at the time a cash loan is made; (2) notify a policyholder who obtains a premium loan of the initial rate of interest on the loan as soon as it is reasonably possible to do so after making an initial premium loan; except as provided in (3) of this subsection, notice does not have to be given to the policyholder when a second or subsequent premium loan is added; (3) send reasonable advance notice of any increase in the rate to a policyholder who has a policy loan; and (4) include other relevant information on adjustment of interest rates in a notice required under this subsection.  The loan value of the policy shall be determined in accordance with (a) of this section.  A policy may not be terminated in a policy year as the sole result of a change in the interest rate during that policy year. If an interest rate changes, the insurer shall maintain coverage during the policy year until the date on which the policy would have terminated if the interest rate had not changed.

The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in (h), (i), (j) and (m) of this section, whichever is applicable. Except as is required by the next succeeding sentence of this subsection, the percentage (1) must be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the later of (A) the fifth policy anniversary and (B) the first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness of at least two-tenths of one percent of either the amount, of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years; and (2) must be such that no percentage after the later of the two policy anniversaries specified in (1) of this subsection may apply to fewer than five consecutive policy years.

Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection, any deferred annuity contract may provide that, if no considerations have been received under a contract for a period of two full years and the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit at maturity on the plan stipulated in the contract arising from considerations paid before that period would be less than $20 monthly, the company may, at its option, terminate the contract by payment in cash of the then present value of the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit, calculated on the basis of the mortality table, if any, and interest rate specified in the contract for determining the paid-up annuity benefit, and by that payment shall be relieved of any further obligation under the contract.

The present value at the contract issue date, and at each following redetermination date, of the additional reduction may not exceed the market value of the benefit.

     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t21c48s21.48.060ol11">
       the debtors eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all of the debtors of the creditor whose indebtedness is repayable either (A) in installments, or (B) in one sum at the end of a period not in excess of 18 months from the initial date of the debt, or all of any class or classes of them determined by conditions pertaining to the indebtedness or the purchase giving rise to the indebtedness; the policy may provide that the term “debtors” includes the debtors of one or more subsidiary corporations, and the debtors of one or more affiliated corporations, proprietors, or partnerships if the business of the policyholder and of the affiliated corporations, proprietors, or partnerships is under common control;
      </li>
      <li id="t21c48s21.48.060ol12">
       the premium for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder, either from the creditor’s funds or from charges collected from the insured debtors or from both; a policy on which part or all of the premium is to be derived from the collection from the insured debtors of identifiable charges not required of uninsured debtors may not include, in the class or classes of debtors eligible for insurance, debtors under obligations outstanding at its date of issue without evidence of individual insurability unless at least 75 percent of the then eligible debtors elect to pay the required charges; a policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from the collection of the identifiable charges must insure all eligible debtors, or all except those whose evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer;
      </li>
      <li id="t21c48s21.48.060ol13">
       the policy may be issued only if the group of eligible debtors is then receiving new entrants at the rate of at least 100 persons yearly, or may reasonably be expected to receive at least 100 new entrants during the first policy year, and only if the policy reserves to the insurer the right to require evidence of individual insurability if less than 75 percent of the new entrants become insured; the policy may exclude from the classes eligible for insurance classes of debtors determined by age;

      <li id="t21c48s21.48.060ol14">
       the amount of insurance on the life of a debtor may at no time exceed the amount owed by the debtor to the creditor; if the insurance is in connection with an educational credit transaction commitment, the amount owed by the debtor to the creditor may be considered to include the portion of the educational loan commitment that has not been advanced by the creditor; if the indebtedness is repayable in one sum to the creditor, the insurance on the life of a debtor may in no instance be in effect for a period in excess of 18 months, except that the insurance may be continued for an additional period not exceeding six months in the case of default, extension, or recasting of the loan;

      If an individual insured under a group life insurance policy hereafter delivered in this state becomes entitled under the terms of the policy to have an individual policy of life insurance issued without evidence of insurability, subject to making application and paying the first premium within the period specified in the policy, and if the individual is not given notice of the existence of the right at least 15 days before the expiration date of the period, the individual shall have an additional period within which to exercise the right, but nothing in this section may be construed to continue an insurance beyond the period provided in the policy.
      This additional period shall expire 15 days after the individual is given notice, but in no event may the additional period extend beyond 60 days after the expiration date of the period provided in the policy. Written notice presented to the individual or mailed by the policyholder to the last known address of the individual or mailed by the insurer to the last known address of the individual as furnished by the policyholder constitutes notice for the purpose of this section.

A filing may become effective at the end of the waiting period unless disapproved by the director during the waiting period. If an insurer fails to provide information requested by the director during the waiting period, the filing is considered withdrawn by the insurer, and the premium rate does not become effective.

      <li id="t21c54a01s21.54.050ol1a">
       All benefits under a blanket health insurance policy shall be paid to (1) the person insured; (2) the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries of the person insured; (3) the estate of the person insured; (4) the parent, guardian, or other person actually supporting the person insured, if the person insured is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid release; or (5) the employer, if the entire cost of the insurance has been paid by the employer. An insurer may, and upon written request of the covered person shall, within 30 working days after receiving a proof of loss statement, pay benefits directly to the provider of the hospital, nursing, medical, dental, or surgical services. The policy may not contain a provision requiring that services be provided by a particular hospital or person, except as applicable to a health maintenance organization under AS 21.86. If the insurer pays indemnities to the insured after the covered person has given the insurer written notice in the proof of loss statement of an election of direct payment of indemnities to the provider of the service, the insurer shall also pay those indemnities to the provider of the service.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c54a01s21.54.050ol1b">
       A covered person may revoke an election of direct payment of benefits made under (a) of this section by giving written notice of the revocation to the insurer and to the provider of the services. The written notice of revocation given to the insurer must certify that the covered person has given written notice of revocation to the provider of the services. Revocation of an election of direct payment is not effective until the notice of revocation is received by the insurer and the provider of the services.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c54a01s21.54.050ol1c">
       The right of the covered person to request payment of indemnities under a group health insurance policy directly to the provider of the services or to another person may be transferred to a person who is not the covered person by a qualified domestic relations order. Rights under the qualified domestic relations order do not take effect until the order is received by the insurer. In this subsection, “qualified domestic relations order” means an order or judgment in a divorce or dissolution action under AS 25.24 that designates a person to determine to whom indemnities for a covered person should be paid under a health insurance policy.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c54a01s21.54.050ol1d">
       This section does not prohibit an insurer from recovering an indemnity mistakenly paid to a provider or a covered person.

      A title insurance company may invest in title plants if it complies at all times with the minimum capital investment requirements under this chapter.

        Finality for collateral estoppel purposes. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An order in the course of an insurance liquidation proceeding is not sufficiently final to give rise to collateral estoppel unless the court has entered a final judgment or has certified the issue pursuant to Civil Rule 54(b). Therefore, superior court’s order declining to hear insurer’s first motion seeking to set aside and terminate an irrevocable trust did not bar it from considering the merits of whether it should hear insurer’s second motion.

       Alaska’s insurer liquidation statutes require the superior court to conduct an independent review of claims; since no hearing is required on claims before the receiver, due process requires a de novo evidentiary hearing before the court, rather than review of the receiver’s findings under the substantial evidence test.

The court may, on due notice, order a transfer or obligation to be preserved for the benefit of the estate, and in that event, the receiver shall succeed to and may enforce the rights of the purchaser, lienor, or obligee.

       After all statutory priorities, i.e., the administrative expenses of the receiver and the Alaska Insurance Guaranty Association, are satisfied, if the remaining assets are insufficient to satisfy all claims of all other creditors, they are to share pro rata in whatever payment is made.

      The amount recoverable by the receiver from reinsurers may not be reduced as a result of delinquency proceedings, regardless of a provision in the reinsurance contract or other agreement. Payment made directly to an insured or other creditor does not diminish the reinsurer’s obligation to the insurer’s estate unless the reinsurance contract provided for direct coverage of a named insured and the payment was made in discharge of that obligation.

       For the purpose of providing funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association, the Board of Governors shall by resolution assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at a time and for an amount that the board finds necessary. Assessments are authorized when a resolution is passed and are due not less than 30 days after prior written notice to the member insurers and accrue interest at 10 percent a year from the date payment is due. Authorized assessments become called when notice is mailed by the association to member insurers.

         class B assessments shall be authorized and called only as necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association with regard to an impaired or an insolvent insurer.

      <li id="t21c79s21.79.070ol1c">
       The amount of a class A assessment shall be determined by the board and may be made on a pro rata or non pro rata basis. If a pro rata assessment is made, the board may provide that it be credited against future class B assessments. The amount of a class B assessment, except for assessments related to long-term care insurance, shall be allocated for assessment purposes between the accounts and among the subaccounts of the life insurance and annuity account under an allocation formula that may be based on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer or by another standard determined by the board in its sole discretion as being fair and reasonable under the circumstances. The amount of the class B assessment for long-term care insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer shall be allocated according to a methodology included in the association’s plan of operation approved by the director. The methodology must provide for 50 percent of the assessment to be allocated to accident and health member insurers and 50 percent to be allocated to life and annuity member insurers.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c79s21.79.070ol1d">
       Class B assessments shall be based on the premiums received on business in this state by each assessed member insurer on policies or contracts covered by each account in proportion to the premiums received on business in this state by all assessed member insurers during the three calendar years preceding the year in which the insolvency or impairment occurred.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c79s21.79.070ol1e">
       The association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board, a payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. The amount by which an assessment against a member insurer is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in (c) of this section. Once the conditions that caused a deferral are removed or rectified, the member insurer shall pay all assessments that were deferred under a repayment plan approved by the association.

       Except as provided in this subsection, the total of all assessments on a member insurer for each subaccount of the life and annuity account and for the health account may not in any one calendar year exceed two percent of the member insurer’s average annual premiums received in this state on policies or contracts covered by the account or subaccount during the three calendar years preceding the year in which the member insurer became an impaired or insolvent insurer. If two or more assessments are authorized in one calendar year with respect to member insurers that become impaired or insolvent in different calendar years, the average annual premiums for purposes of the aggregate assessment percentage limitation imposed under this subsection shall be limited to the highest of the average annual premiums during the preceding three calendar years for the applicable subaccount or account as calculated under this section. If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in an account, does not provide in any one year in either account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary additional funds shall be assessed as soon as permitted by this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c79s21.79.070ol1g">

       If the maximum assessment for a subaccount of the life and annuity account in any one year does not provide an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the board shall, as provided under (d) of this section, access all subaccounts of the life and annuity account for the necessary additional amount, subject to the assessment limit provided in (f) of this section.

      <li id="t21c79s21.79.070ol1i">
       Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer may not be authorized or called until necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter. Classification of assessments under (b) of this section and computation of assessments under this section shall be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible. The association shall notify each member insurer of its anticipated pro rata share of an authorized assessment not yet called within 180 days after the assessment is authorized.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c79s21.79.070ol1j">
       The board may, by an equitable method as established in the plan of operation, refund to member insurers, in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to that account, the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the amount the board finds is necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the association with regard to that account, including assets accruing from assignment, subrogation, net realized gains, and income from investments. A reasonable amount may be retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the association and for future losses claims.

       A member insurer may, in determining its premium rates and policy owner dividends as to any kind of insurance, hospital or medical service corporation business, or health maintenance organization business within the scope of this chapter, consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations under this chapter.

      <li id="t21c79s21.79.070ol1l">
       A member insurer that wishes to protest all or part of an assessment shall pay when due the full amount of the assessment as set out in the notice provided by the association. The payment shall be available to meet association obligations during the pendency of the protest or any subsequent appeal. If a payment is made under protest, payment must be accompanied by a statement in writing that the payment is made under protest and setting out a brief statement of the grounds for the protest. Within 60 days following the payment of an assessment under protest by a member insurer, the association shall notify the member insurer in writing of its determination with respect to the protest unless the association notifies the member insurer that additional time is required to resolve the issues raised by the protest. Within 30 days after a final decision has been made, the association shall notify the protesting member insurer in writing of that final decision. Within 60 days after receipt of notice of the final decision, the protesting member insurer may appeal that final action to the director. In the alternative to rendering a final decision with respect to a protest based on a question regarding the assessment base, the association may refer protests to the director for a final decision with or without recommendation from the association. If a protest or appeal on an assessment is upheld, the amount paid in error or excess shall be returned to the member insurer. Interest on a refund due a protesting member insurer shall be paid at the rate actually earned by the association.

      The purposes of this chapter are to provide a mechanism for the payment of covered claims under certain insurance policies to avoid excessive delay in payment and, to the extent provided in this chapter, to minimize financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer, and to provide an association to assess the cost of this protection among insurers.

       Subsection (a)(7) of this section, which states that the association “shall pay the other expenses of the association authorized by this chapter,” should be construed in light of the general purpose of the association which is to “[pay] covered claims
       —. to avoid financial loss to claimants or policyholders.”

      </p>
      <p>
       Since law firms, attorneys, and insurance claims adjusters who were retained by insolvent insurance companies to adjust, settle, and defend claims and lawsuits against policyholders of automobile liability insurance, were neither policyholders nor claimants, the association should not be required to absorb the costs of litigating an action by them for payment for services rendered.

       Law firms, attorneys, and insurance claims adjusters who were retained by insolvent insurance companies to adjust, settle, and defend claims and lawsuits against policyholders of automobile liability insurance, did not fit into the category of “insured” or “claimant” and thus could not invoke the protection of the “covered claims” clause of this chapter.

However, a society may not indemnify or reimburse a person in connection with a matter in an action, suit, or proceeding, or threat of an action, suit, or proceeding, that has been made the subject of a compromise settlement, or in which the person is adjudged to be guilty of breach of a duty as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the society, unless the person acted in good faith for a purpose the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the society, and, in a criminal action or proceeding, in addition, had no reasonable cause to believe that the person’s conduct constituted a violation of a criminal law of this state or another jurisdiction. The determination of whether the conduct of the person meets the standard required to justify indemnification and reimbursement may be made by the supreme governing body or the board of directors through a majority vote of a quorum consisting of persons who were not parties to the action, suit, or proceeding or by a court of competent jurisdiction. The termination of an action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or plea of no contest as to the person does not in itself create a conclusive presumption that the person did not meet the standard of conduct required to justify indemnification and reimbursement.

        This section does not require stacking in the single policy context.
       </b>
       This conclusion follows from the fact that uninsured motorists insurance may be waived in Alaska. Curran v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., 393 F. Supp. 712 (D. Alaska 1975).

        Relationship between Acts. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act and the Mandatory Automobile Insurance Act coexist as components of the Alaska Uniform Vehicle Code and the latter supplements, but does not supplant, the former. Progressive Ins. Co. v. Simmons, 953 P.2d 510 (Alaska 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       All insurance policies in the state must conform to the content requirements of the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act (MVSRA), and if the content requirements of a mandatory act are broader than those of the MVSRA, those requirements must also be complied with as to persons covered by the mandatory act. Holderness v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 24 P.3d 1235 (Alaska 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c)’s incorporation of the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act’s (MVSRA) comparable content requirements for liability and underinsured motorist coverage prevailed over its incorporation of the Alaska Mandatory Automobile Insurance Act’s (AMAIA) umbrella policy exclusion, because subsection (c) has been interpreted to demand primary compliance with the MVSRA, unless the AMAIA imposes broader requirements. Holderness v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 24 P.3d 1235 (Alaska 2001).

        Insured was allowed to “stack”

       the uninsured motorists coverage provided him in a single multivehicle policy where the insured, under the interpretation of the contract propounded by the insurer, would receive absolutely no additional coverage for his premium dollars paid for uninsured motorists coverage on the vehicles other than the one involved in the accident and where the only possible interpretation of the contract was that the uninsured motorists premiums paid in connection with the other vehicles were meant to increase the amount of coverage, the limits of liability clause notwithstanding.

        Private cause of action under (c) and (e). —

      <p>
       When the six factors listed in § 874A of the Second Restatement of Torts that are considered helpful in determining whether or not a private cause of action should be implied based on a statute are applied to subsections (c) and (e), they indicate that a private cause of action should be allowed. Peter v. Schumacher Enters., 22 P.3d 481 (Alaska 2001).

      </p>
      <p>
       Subsections (c) and (e) do not give rise to an implied cause of action against insurance agents in cases where their principals did not comply with the requirements of those subsections, nor should they serve as the basis for imposing a common-law duty on insurance agents.

       “Coverage required” under subsection (e) must be waived in writing, but “optional limits” in the second sentence of (e) is a subject separate from required coverage, and the “coverage required” by subsections (c) and (d) is for bodily injury and for property damage which must be purchased unless the buyer waives it in writing. If the coverage is not waived in writing, it must be for the minimum limits prescribed in subsections (c) and (d), but the higher limits that must be offered under subsection (c)(2)(A)-(E) need not be accepted.

        Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the insurer is required to offer uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage in the amount of liability coverage purchased voluntarily, the statutory minimum of underinsured motor vehicle insurance coverage is the actual amount of liability insurance purchased. Burton v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., 796 P.2d 1361 (Alaska 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage required to be provided includes sums for prejudgment interest and Civil Rule 82 attorney’s fees in addition to the facial policy State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Harrington, 918 P.2d 1022 (Alaska 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       The language of subsection (c) means that that all policies in the state must conform to the content requirements of the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, and that if the content requirements of the Mandatory Automobile Insurance Act are broader than those of the former, those requirements must also be complied with as to persons covered by the latter. Progressive Ins. Co. v. Simmons, 953 P.2d 510 (Alaska 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Insurers were entitled to summary judgment on uninsured and underinsured motorists (UIM) coverage claims; this section does not require that insurers’ application forms state the premiums charged for each level of UIM coverage, nor are insurers required to quote premium prices when they first mention that multiple levels of coverage are available. Gov't Emples. Ins. Co. v. Graham-Gonzalez, 107 P.3d 279 (Alaska 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an employee, while driving drunk with a company car, was injured and sought uninsured motorist benefits under the company's policy, a policy clause that excluded coverage for anyone using a vehicle without a reasonable belief that the person was entitled to do so, was void because it restricted the minimum coverage required. Yeager v. Phila. Indem. Ins. Co., — F. Supp. 3d — (D. Alaska June 10, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arbitration panels exceeded their authority by purporting to determine the total benefit amounts an insurer owed the insureds under their coverages since the panels had authority to determine only each insured's damages arising from the at-fault driver's conduct; only a court, not an arbitration panel, could determine whether the insureds were entitled to prejudgment interest on the insurer's liability to the insureds, attorney's fees, and pro rata attorney's fees for subrogated claims. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Harbour, 491 P.3d 374 (Alaska 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the arbitration panels had no authority to determine anything beyond the insureds' damages arising from their accidents, and because the insurer withheld its consent for the panels to determine anything else, the superior court erred in affirming the final arbitration awards; the arbitration clause was not an expansive provision covering any and all claims arising out of or related to the insurer's insurance policy or even the uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Harbour, 491 P.3d 374 (Alaska 2021).

If the insured and the insurer fail to agree on the amount of a covered first party loss, either may make written demand upon the other to submit the dispute for appraisal. Within 10 days of the written demand, the insured and insurer must notify the other of the competent appraiser each has selected. The two appraisers will promptly choose a competent and impartial umpire. Not later than 15 days after the umpire has been chosen, unless the time period is extended by the umpire, each appraiser will separately state in writing the amount of the loss. If the appraisers submit a written report of agreement on the amount of the loss, the agreed amount will be binding upon the insured and insurer. If the appraisers fail to agree, the appraisers will promptly submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by one of the appraisers and the umpire will be binding upon the insured and insurer. All expenses and fees, not including counsel or adjuster fees, incurred because of the appraisal shall be paid as determined by the umpire. Except as specifically provided, nothing in this section is intended to or shall in any manner limit or restrict the rights of insureds or insurers or confer any rights to an insured or insurer.

      <p>
       Mandatory appraisal statute does not apply to an insured’s uninsured motorist personal injury claim because (1) a “loss for personal property” was not a “loss for a personal injury claim,” as the insured sought appraisal of an injury, (2) including all “choses in action” as “personal property” made statutory limits superfluous, and (3) the statute’s “appraisal” mandate was not the same as “arbitration.” McDonnell v.

      <li id="t21c96s21.96.100ol1a">
       If an insurer has a duty to defend an insured under a policy of insurance and a conflict of interest arises that imposes a duty on the insurer to provide independent counsel to the insured, the insurer shall provide independent counsel to the insured unless the insured in writing waives the right to independent counsel. An insurance policy may contain a provision that provides a method of selecting independent counsel if the provision complies with this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c96s21.96.100ol1b">
       For purposes of this section, the following do not constitute a conflict of interest:

        <li id="t21c96s21.96.100ol1b1">
         a claim of punitive damages;

         claims or facts in a civil action for which the insurer denies coverage.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t21c96s21.96.100ol1c">
       Notwithstanding (b) of this section, if the insurer reserves the insurer’s rights on an issue for which coverage is denied, the insurer shall provide independent counsel to the insured as provided under (a) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c96s21.96.100ol1d">
       If the insured selects independent counsel at the insurer’s expense, the insurer may require that the independent counsel have at least four years of experience in civil litigation, including defense experience in the general subject area at issue in the civil action, and malpractice insurance. Unless otherwise provided in the insurance policy, the obligation of the insurer to pay the fee charged by the independent counsel is limited to the rate that is actually paid by the insurer to an attorney in the ordinary course of business in the defense of a similar civil action in the community in which the claim arose or is being defended. In providing independent counsel, the insurer is not responsible for the fees and costs of defending an allegation for which coverage is properly denied and shall be responsible only for the fees and costs to defend those allegations for which the insurer either reserves its position as to coverage or accepts coverage. The independent counsel shall keep detailed records allocating fees and costs accordingly. A dispute between the insurer and insured regarding attorney fees that is not resolved by the insurance policy or this section shall be resolved by arbitration under AS 09.43.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c96s21.96.100ol1e">
       If the insured selects independent counsel at the insurer’s expense, the independent counsel and the insured shall consult with the insurer on all matters relating to the civil action and shall disclose to the insurer in a timely manner all information relevant to the civil action, except information that is privileged and relevant to disputed coverage. A claim of privilege is subject to review in the appropriate court. Information disclosed by the independent counsel or the insured does not waive another party’s right to assert privilege.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c96s21.96.100ol1f">
       An insured may waive the right to select independent counsel by signing a statement that reads substantially as follows:
      </li>
      <li id="t21c96s21.96.100ol1g">
       If an insured selects independent counsel under this section, both the counsel representing the insurer and independent counsel representing the insured shall be allowed to participate in all aspects of the civil action. Counsel for the insurer and insured shall cooperate fully in exchanging information that is consistent with ethical and legal obligations to the insured. Nothing in this section relieves the insured of the duty to cooperate fully with the insurer as required by the terms of the insurance policy.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c96s21.96.100ol1h">
       When an insured is represented by independent counsel, the insurer may settle directly with the plaintiff if the settlement includes all claims based upon the allegations for which the insurer previously reserved its position as to coverage or accepted coverage, regardless of whether the settlement extinguishes all claims against the insured.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      I have been advised of my right to select independent counsel to represent me in this lawsuit and of my right under state law to have all reasonable expenses of an independent counsel paid by my insurer. I have also been advised that the Alaska Supreme Court has ruled that when an insurer defends an insured under a reservation of rights provision in an insurance policy, there are various conflicts of interest that arise between an insurer and an insured. I have considered this matter fully and at this time I am waiving my right to select independent counsel. I have authorized my insurer to select a defense counsel to represent me in this lawsuit.

       Questions were certified to the Alaska Supreme Court as this section did not squarely address whether a law firm’s malpractice insurer could seek reimbursement of expenses it incurred in providing a defense pursuant to a reservation of rights where the policy and the reservation of rights letter permitted reimbursement, and either the claims were not covered or the duty to defend never arose. Attys. Liab. Prot. Soc'y, Inc. v. Ingaldson Fitzgerald, P.C., 766 F.3d 1180 (9th Cir. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court properly granted an insured's motion for partial summary judgment on the insurer's claim for reimbursement of defense costs because the reimbursement provision in the policy was unenforceable where Alaska law prohibited reimbursement of fees and costs incurred by the insurer defending claims under a reservation of rights, even in circumstances where it was later discovered that there was “no possibility of coverage” under the policy. Attys. Liab. Prot. Soc'y, Inc. v. Ingaldson Fitzgerald, P.C., 370 P.3d 1101 (Alaska 2016), overruled in part, Buntin v. Schlumberger Tech. Corp., 487 P.3d 595 (Alaska 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       Liability Risk Retention Act of 1986 (LRRA), 15 U.S.C.S. §§ 3901-3906, preempts Alaska's prohibition of insurance policy provisions requiring reimbursement of fees and costs incurred by a risk retention group defending a non-covered claim; exceptions under the LRRA do not permit regulation of substantive policy terms by non-chartering states. Attys. Liab. Prot. Soc'y, Inc. v. Ingaldson Fitzgerald, P.C., 838 F.3d 976 (9th Cir. Alaska 2016).
