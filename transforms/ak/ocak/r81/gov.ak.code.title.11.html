       In a case in which defendant was convicted of fourth degree theft, the district court erred in including additional language in the pattern jury instruction regarding accomplice liability because defendant's case was not a case that involved the more subtle forms of abetting, as the State's theory of prosecution was that defendant directly participated in the theft; however, the error was harmless as the trial focused on whether defendant actively participated in the shoplifting, the jury was otherwise properly instructed on the elements of complicity, and the jury was specifically instructed that mere knowledge and failure to report a crime was not sufficient to establish vicarious liability.

       Police did not need a warrant to arrest defendant for sexual assault in the first degree because they had probable cause, based in part on the victim’s statement that she had been raped by two men and an identification of defendant by the other man.

        Evidence sufficient to establish accomplice liability. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient for convictions of first-degree assault and kidnapping, where defendant and a cohort bound and repeatedly hit a victim over several hours, based on a theory of accomplice liability under paragraph (2) of this section, since defendant and the cohort both actively participated in the binding of the victim and in repeatedly striking him, which resulted in serious injury to the victim, including broken ribs, a broken ankle, and a punctured lung. Anderson v. State, 163 P.3d 1000 (Alaska Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1249, 128 S. Ct. 1486, 170 L. Ed. 2d 306 (U.S. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s second-degree theft convictions because (1) the State did not have to prove under the complicity statute that defendant committed thefts personally, and (2) defendant was criminally responsible for all the thefts.
       McCourt v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Mar. 5, 2014) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s conviction for robbery in the first degree was proper where the evidence showed that defendant assisted the robbery by holding the restaurant door open.
       Egbe v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Feb. 8, 2012) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if a cautionary instruction was not an adequate remedy for the potential danger posed by questions to defendant referring to her husband’s purported out-of-court statements, the error was harmless because the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that defendant acted with the mens rea for accomplice liability to first-degree murder. Estes v. State, 249 P.3d 313 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011).

       If appellant was an accomplice to the burglaries, then she could be held accountable for repaying the losses of the victims regarding all the unrecovered property.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a case in which defendant's third conviction for evidence tampering was based on evidence that he solicited or directed his son to remove all the marijuana plants and seeds from the house, and to throw those materials over the riverbank, the evidence was sufficient to sustain that conviction because, although there was no evidence that defendant personally removed the marijuana from the residence, the evidence showed that defendant solicited or directed his son to remove the marijuana and dispose of it; thus, defendant could be found criminally responsible for his son's action.

       Under the complicity statute, there is no criminal liability if the state can prove only that the defendant recklessly disregarded the possibility that his conduct might promote or facilitate a crime, since all accomplice behavior must be intentional.

      <p>
       In determining an accomplice’s liability for the crime committed by another, the focus is not only upon the substantive offense committed by the perpetrator; it is also upon the accomplice’s acts and mental state vis-a-vis the criminal enterprise in general. Hensel v. State, 604 P.2d 222 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to the mental element, liability for the crime of another will attach only upon a showing that an individual had knowledge of the criminal enterprise and specifically intended, by his conduct, to aid, abet, assist, or participate in the criminal enterprise. Hensel v. State, 604 P.2d 222 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was sufficient evidence to support a second-degree murder conviction under an accomplice liability theory where the defendant participated in the severe beating of the victim, although another inflicted the fatal injuries. From the evidence, a fair-minded juror could reasonably infer that defendant’s actions constituted aiding and abetting the principal actor’s assault on the victim and constituted a manifest indifference to human life.

       The trial court did not err in not having its complicity instructions track the words of this section because under plain error review the concept of complicity was adequately communicated when the jury was informed not to convict the accomplice unless they were convinced that he had desired to see the crime succeed and that he had performed acts in furtherance of this desire.

      <p>
       In a prosecution for second-degree robbery, even though the state’s primary theory was that the defendant struck the victim, while others took the property, it was not error for the trial court to instruct on accomplice liability since, to evaluate the defendant’s guilt, the jury necessarily had to receive instruction of the rules governing the defendant’s liability for the acts of the others in taking the property. Baker v. State, 905 P.2d 479 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where eyewitnesses saw defendant and his accomplice beat a homeless man to death in an empty lot, defendant was properly convicted of second degree murder, and the the trial court did not err by instructing the jury as to accomplice liability. Grossman v. State, 120 P.3d 1085 (Alaska Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In convictions of first-degree assault and kidnapping, based on a theory of accomplice liability where defendant and a cohort bound and repeatedly hit a victim over several hours, the jury was properly instructed under paragraph (2) of this section that accomplice liability required knowing and assisting or participating with criminal intent, the instruction did not have to state that defendant specifically intended the precise crimes that were committed to have been accomplished.

       Reversal of a business corporation's conviction for fourth-degree assault, based on the conduct of its security personnel in the assault of an unruly patron at the bar and grill which the corporation ran, was appropriate because the jury was wrongly instructed with regard to whether the corporation was criminally responsible for the conduct of its personnel in that the jury instruction misstated the State of Alaska's burden of proof to be by a preponderance of the evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt.

       Reversal of a business corporation's conviction for fourth-degree assault, based on the alleged conduct of a supervisor of its security personnel in soliciting a security guard to assault an unruly patron at the bar and grill which the corporation ran, was appropriate because the jury was never directly instructed on what the phrase “solicited by the corporation” meant. Instead, the jury was wrongly told that a solicitation made by any employee was to be viewed as a solicitation made by the corporation. AB&amp;M Enters. v. State, 389 P.3d 863 (Alaska Ct.

      <p>
       <b>
        The word “attempt”
       </b>
       generally means the trial or physical effort to do a particular thing. Wooldridge v. United States, 237 F. 775, 4 Alaska Fed. 485 (9th Cir. Alaska 1916).

      </p>
      <p>
       In the area of attempt, criminal culpability was present under former AS 11.05.020 where there was the formation of criminal attempt, a preparation to commit the crime, and a direct unequivocal act toward its perpetration. Braham v. State, 571 P.2d 631 (Alaska 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 910, 98 S. Ct. 2246, 56 L. Ed. 2d 410 (U.S. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Mere preparation
       </b>
       to commit a crime, not followed by an overt act done toward its commission, did not constitute an attempt under former AS 11.05.020.
       There were borderline cases where it was sometimes difficult to determine whether preparation to commit a crime has come near enough to the accomplishment of the act so that an attempt had been committed. Gargan v. State, 436 P.2d 968 (Alaska 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mere preparation to commit a crime, not followed by an overt act done toward its commission, did not constitute an attempt. Lemke v. United States, 211 F.2d 73, 14 Alaska 587 (9th Cir. Alaska), cert. denied, 347 U.S. 1013, 74 S. Ct. 866, 98 L. Ed. 1136 (U.S. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       When one’s acts were of such a preliminary nature so as to constitute mere preparation for the contemplated crime, there was no crime of attempt. Braham v. State, 571 P.2d 631 (Alaska 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 910, 98 S. Ct. 2246, 56 L. Ed. 2d 410 (U.S. 1978).

       <b>
        Question of degree. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether acts taken or done in contemplation of the commission of a crime were merely preparatory and did not constitute attempt, or whether they were sufficiently close to the consummation of the crime to amount to attempt, was a question of degree and depended upon the facts and circumstances of a particular case. Braham v. State, 571 P.2d 631 (Alaska 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 910, 98 S. Ct. 2246, 56 L. Ed. 2d 410 (U.S. 1978).

        Double jeopardy. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutes which proscribe attempted murder, possession of explosives, and arson differ markedly in the conduct which they prohibit and in the specific societal interests which they seek to preserve, and multiple sentences for the three offenses do not violate double jeopardy. Machado v. State, 797 P.2d 677 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).

       <b>
        Inadequacy of former statute. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Former AS 11.05.020 was apparently inadequate to codify effectively as a crime the situation involving the single act of contracting for another to perform a criminal act. Braham v. State, 571 P.2d 631 (Alaska 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 910, 98 S. Ct. 2246, 56 L. Ed. 2d 410 (U.S. 1978).

       Since under Alaska law, delivery of cocaine is expressly defined to include an attempted delivery, the more specific statute controls and this section, the general attempt statute, is therefore not applicable to delivery of cocaine. Stuart v. State, 698 P.2d 1218 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).

      <p>
       <b>
        Where defendant contracted with someone to kill another,
       </b>
       when he instructed the killer to visit the victim, his intention being that there would be fostered a relationship of trust and confidence between the killer and the victim, thus placing the killer in a position where he would be closer to the victim and could more readily kill him, the killer’s visit with the victim, at defendant’s direction, was the doing of a direct, unequivocal act toward the commission of the crime of murder, which followed the formation of a criminal intent and a preparation to commit this crime. Braham v. State, 571 P.2d 631 (Alaska 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 910, 98 S. Ct. 2246, 56 L. Ed. 2d 410 (U.S. 1978).

       A factual impossibility which was not apparent to the actor at the time should not, as a matter of policy, insulate him from conviction for attempting the commission of the offense. Gargan v. State, 436 P.2d 968 (Alaska 1968).

The grand jury could reasonably have inferred that defendant believed the drugs were the illegal form of Ecstasy.

        Attempted sexual assault in the second degree. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of attempted sexual assault in the second degree; an eyewitness’s testimony, which was corroborated, was that the victim was incapacitated. Other corroborating evidence led the trial judge to the conclusion that defendant had at least attempted sexual penetration, which might not have been completed due to defendant’s obvious level of intoxication.
       Cano v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Oct. 7, 2009) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction of attempted second-degree sexual abuse of a minor because it showed that while in the victim’s bedroom defendant put his fingers slightly inside her pants and he put one hand on her ribs below her breast. There was also evidence that earlier in the living room defendant tried to kiss the victim, touched her breast, and put his fingertips inside the waistband of her pants. Kvasnikoff v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Dec. 3, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's indictment was properly dismissed where the evidence showed that he engaged in offensive and unwanted touching of the victim, but did not show that he acted with the intent to force his hand down the victim's pants and touch her genitals without consent. State v. Mayfield, 442 P.3d 794 (Alaska Ct. App. 2019).

       , the State must establish that: the defendant (1) intended to engage in sexual contact with the victim; (2) recklessly disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the victim was unwilling to engage in the sexual contact; (3) intended to use force or threat of force if necessary to achieve the sexual contact; and (4) took a substantial step toward achievement of the completed crime.

       <b>
        Failure to include “substantial step” language in indictment for attempted murder

       was a defect only as to form, where the indictment included a concise description of defendant’s actions that constituted the offense, including the proper language regarding his state of mind. Ciervo v. State, 756 P.2d 907 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988), overruled, Swain v. State, 817 P.2d 927 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).

       There is authority for the proposition that a specific intent must be proven for the crime of attempted rape. But there is no authority supporting the proposition that the indictment must specify that intent. State v. Thomas, 525 P.2d 1092 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though there is no question that the crime of attempt requires a specific intent, it seems equally beyond dispute that a charge of attempt to commit a specific crime clearly advises the defendant of the offense with which he is charged. State v. Thomas, 525 P.2d 1092 (Alaska 1974).

       Trial court was not required to merge charges of first degree sexual assault and attempted first degree sexual assault offenses for sentencing purposes.

       Where defendant was charged with attempted first-degree sexual assault, attempted second-degree sexual assault, and burglary, defendant’s intoxication at the time of the offense offered a defense to the culpable mental state. Moore v. State, 123 P.3d 1081 (Alaska Ct. App. 2005).

      <p>
       Trial court's instruction tracking the language of the intoxication defense statute was flawed because the instruction referred only to the fact that voluntary intoxication could negate an element of an offense that required that defendant intentionally cause a result, but the two charges of attempted first-degree sexual assault did not involve actual causation of a result as those charges required the State to prove that defendant intended to cause a result; thus, the jury should have been instructed that voluntary intoxication could negate an element of an offense that required that defendant intentionally cause or attempt to cause a specified result; however, that flaw was remedied by the summations of the parties.

       In a prosecution for possession of narcotic drugs, although there was no substantial evidence that defendant committed the crime charged in the information, there was substantial evidence that she attempted to commit the crime charged. Simpson v. United States, 195 F.2d 721, 13 Alaska 635 (9th Cir. Alaska 1952).

      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported defendant’s conviction for attempted first-degree sexual assault; the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, established that defendant attacked wife and removed some of her clothing while the wife vigorously resisted. Sergie v. State, 105 P.3d 1150 (Alaska Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was adequate to support a conclusion that defendant was guilty of attempted possession of a controlled substance. The jury knew that defendant actively tracked the whereabouts of a package containing pain killers, knew when the package should have arrived, and called the post office to determine the package’s whereabouts when it was not delivered.

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to reasonably establish defendant’s purpose and to support his conviction for attempted first-degree sexual assault because he had a sexual purpose when he began groping the victim; and he beat the victim and dragged her toward some bushes so that he could further his sexual assault on her. Moore v. State, 262 P.3d 217 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011).

       Where defendant presented a check payable to himself, drawn on an account where checks had been reported stolen, and where he left the bank, leaving the check, after the teller took the check to obtain advice from the manager, a reasonable jury could conclude that the defendant attempted to deprive another person of property.

Sexual charges based on non-consensual genital intercourse do not require proof of a specific sexual intent, and plain error was not established though the prosecutor’s expressions which might have been construed as a personal opinion of the guilt of the defendant or an argument relating to a defendant’s need for treatment were improper and uninvited.

       Defendant’s 75-year prison sentence for first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and first-degree burglary was not erroneous because the trial judge reasonably concluded that a lengthy sentence was necessary to serve as a warning to others who might be tempted by jealousy to turn to extreme violence.

       Superior court properly imposed a composite sentence of 55 years to serve and an additional 10 years suspended for second-degree sexual abuse of a minor and attempted second-degree sexual abuse of a minor because the counts included 15 different acts with 11 different victims over a period of nearly five years, the absence of the “most serious” aggravator meant only that defendant's conduct fell within the broad middle range of conduct, the court was required to impose at least some portion of the sentences consecutively and to suspend at least two to three years of defendant's sentence, and the court thoroughly analyzed the required criteria and concluded a lesser sentence would be insufficient to meet the goals of sentencing.

      <p>
       Where defendant was charged with soliciting the crime of unlawful exploitation of a minor based on his asking victims to take off their clothes and let him photograph them, defendant’s argument that he did not “solicit” the crime because the victims could not be guilty of the intended crime was foreclosed by the provision of this section that it is no defense that the person solicited could not be guilty of the crime that is the object of the solicitation.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s convictions for soliciting the crime of unlawful exploitation of a minor which were based on his asking victims to take off their clothes and let him photograph them were erroneous since defendant did not ask anyone else to engage in the prohibited conduct, i.e., inducing a child to engage in one of the sexual activities prohibited by AS

       Even if the trial court erred in excluding the victim’s statement to her boyfriend that she was planning to obtain crack cocaine, the error was harmless as defendant’s attorney focused primarily on the sexual assault charges, and explored in some detail the victim’s general biases and the inconsistencies in her accounts of the incident, and the jury ultimately acquitted defendant of those charges.

       In a case in which defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit first-degree robbery and in which defendant, who was a first felony offender, faced a presumptive range of 1 to 3 years' imprisonment for the crime, the sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence of 4 years' imprisonment with 2 years suspended as it was above the presumptive range; and the sentence was unlawful because the judge found no aggravating factors.

        Conspiracy is separate offense. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The crime of conspiracy is generally regarded as a separate offense from the substantive crime that is the object of the conspiracy.
       Unlike the other preliminary offenses of attempt and solicitation, conspiracy does not merge into a conviction for the substantive crime. Lythgoe v. State, 626 P.2d 1082 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The no-merger rule means that a defendant can be convicted of both conspiracy and the object of the conspiracy. One reason advanced for this special treatment of conspiracy as a separately punishable offense is that conspiracy has been regarded as a serious crime in itself. Lythgoe v. State, 626 P.2d 1082 (Alaska 1980).

       Defendant should not have been convicted separately for attempt and solicitation because subsection (b) declares that a defendant may be convicted of only one of these inchoate crimes when the charges are based on conduct that is designed to culminate in the commission of the same crime.

       Under the common law,
       
       murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. That definition of murder was substantially the equivalent of that found in former AS

      </p>
      <p>
       Murder, at common law, was defined as the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought, either express or implied.
       Express malice could be found in the deliberate intention of the defendant to take the life of the deceased unlawfully, while implied malice could be found either where the evidence showed circumstances indicating that the defendant had a heart regardless of social duty, in that he knowingly did an act which might result in death or grievous bodily harm, or where defendant killed another in the course of perpetrating a felony. In all of these instances it did not matter whether the defendant actually intended to kill the deceased. Once malice could be found, the defendant could be held liable for all results which flowed naturally and probably from his volitional acts.
       In many cases the killing itself, if unexplained, was enough to support an inference of malice. Gray v. State, 463 P.2d 897 (Alaska), limited, Wilson v. State, 473 P.2d 633 (Alaska 1970).

       Jury properly convicted defendant of attempted first-degree murder, third-degree assault, first-degree harming a police dog, and felony failure to stop at the direction of a peace officer because the evidence, that defendant shot and killed a police dog, and fired multiple rounds in the direction of the two officers, was sufficient to conclude that defendant intended to kill the officers.

       First-degree murder charge was supported by sufficient evidence of an intent to kill where defendant and friend were incensed by the fact that a Toyota had come so close to their car; their anger provided a motive for shooting at the driver. Moreover, the grand jury heard testimony that, when the Toyota failed to stop or veer off following defendant’s rifle shot, defendant declared, “I missed.” Gustafson v.

       Evidence was legally sufficient to support defendant's first-degree murder conviction; although defendant claimed self-defense, even if the jury believed that the victim brought the knife to the encounter and that defendant had disarmed him, defendant went looking for the victim and attacked the victim even after he retreated, and thus defendant acted with the intent to kill.

       Because the heat of passion statute declared that the defense applied only to charges of first-degree murder and charges of second-degree murder, defendant could only claim heat of passion with respect to one of the murder charges against him; since defendant was indicted for first-degree murder, the heat of passion defense potentially applied to that charge.

       Defendant's convictions for first-degree murder and second-degree murder with intent to cause serious physical injury were reversed because it was error to deny a heat of passion jury instruction; defendant presented some evidence of each element of that defense, since defendant told police the victim attacked defendant with a machete and defendant killed the victim immediately after being attacked, and the victim's injuries and defendant's claim defendant blacked out and woke up standing over the victim's body holding a machete supported an inference defendant was in the throes of emotion and out of control when defendant attacked the victim.

       Where defendant was charged with first degree murder and the statute of limitations had run on the lesser offense of manslaughter, while the jury should not be instructed that they might find defendant guilty of manslaughter, defendant was entitled to an instruction on the mitigating effects of passion and provocation, requiring the jury to acquit him if he presented such evidence in mitigation and the state did not negate it.

       Normally a second-degree murder instruction should be given as a matter of course to juries hearing a first-degree murder case.

       Where the jury was given a proper lesser-included offense instruction on murder in the second degree, but nevertheless convicted defendant of murder in the first degree, given the jury’s rejection of second-degree murder as a lesser-included offense, it is evident that defendant suffered no prejudice, even assuming a manslaughter instruction he challenged was inadequate.

       Where defendant convicted of first-degree murder claimed the trial court erred in failing to give a proper instruction on the lesser included offense of manslaughter, premised on the fact that the manslaughter instruction given to the jury referred only to reckless homicide and did not inform the jury that knowing and intentional homicides may qualify as manslaughter, this claim must fail if defendant has suggested no theory under which the evidence might have supported a conviction of manslaughter based on intentional or knowing conduct.

       In defendant's first-degree murder trial, the trial court did not commit obvious error in failing to give defendant's proposed instruction based on a theory of hot pursuit; by the time defendant again confronted the victim, there had been a substantial break in time, and defendant was not entitled to return to the scene of the robbery and attempt to recover his property through the use of force an hour after the taking was complete.

       Trial judge was not clearly mistaken when he sentenced defendant to serve 75 years in prison where the crime was one of domestic violence, defendant had a history of repeated assaultive conduct, and defendant engaged in a significant and protracted effort to conceal the murder and to avoid apprehension. Noyakuk v. State, 127 P.3d 856 (Alaska Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s discretionary parole eligibility was properly restricted until he served 50 years of imprisonment where the trial court decided that defendant should be incarcerated until he was no longer physically able to hurt people. Defendant had 10 prior convictions, including two felonies and two assaults.

        Attorney request for withdrawal on appeal inadequate. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant’s attorney submitted a brief identifying six issues that might be raised on appeal but did not explain why he believed those issues were frivolous, and where the brief contained only a cursory discussion of the facts underlying these potential issues and no discussion of the law, such abbreviated treatment did not allow the court to discharge its constitutional duty to verify independently that defendant’s potential appellate issues were as frivolous as his attorney contended, and prevented the court from ruling on the attorney’s request of withdrawal.
       Johnson v. State, 24 P.3d 1267 (Alaska Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       That crime would have been first-degree murder even under the common law’s more restrictive definition of this crime. This alone would have justified judge in finding defendant’s murder to be among the most serious first-degree murders and to merit the 99-year maximum sentence.

       Where two defendants were convicted of first-degree murder and one of second-degree murder for the same crime, the sentencing judge was entitled to make his own evaluation of the evidence in deciding how culpable was the behavior of the one convicted of second-degree murder, and where the record before the jury sufficed to support the conclusion that she was as guilty of premeditated murder as were the other defendants, the maximum term of 99 years received by each of the defendants, though certainly severe, was justified by the extreme nature of their crime. Ridgley v. State, 739 P.2d 1299 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sentence of consecutive 99-year terms for two murders is not clearly mistaken where the defendant presents a risk of continued criminal conduct which would seriously threaten the public safety. Krukoff v. State, 702 P.2d 664 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sentence of three consecutive 99-year terms for three counts of murder and another consecutive seven-year term for attempted murder (for a total sentence of 304 years) was not excessive, where defendant had gone on a killing spree, essentially hunting his victims down, and there was no way to rule out the possibility that he might commit another series of homicides. Kanulie v. State, 796 P.2d 844 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of parole eligibility for defendant, who received a 99-year sentence after being convicted of murder, was not clearly mistaken, where the record showed him to be a racist, a man full of anger, a man with a severe alcohol problem, and a man with a proclivity for assaulting people with firearms, and showed that he had just been released on felony probation a few days before the murder. Stern v. State, 827 P.2d 442 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sentencing of a 19-year-old to a 65-year term of imprisonment for second-degree murder was justified where defendant had burglarized a store and had stolen about $19,000, threatened two people who knew that he had committed the burglary and theft, had other instances of violent tendencies, and his offense was among the most serious within the definition of second-degree murder because defendant, incensed over a perceived minor slight, deliberately aimed at a small car and, from short range, fired a shot from a high caliber rifle toward its occupants.
       Gustafson v. State, 854 P.2d 751 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s 75-year prison sentence for first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and first-degree burglary was not erroneous because the trial judge reasonably concluded that a lengthy sentence was necessary to serve as a warning to others who might be tempted by jealousy to turn to extreme violence.
       Gordon v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 18, 2010) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly sentenced defendant to 99 years for the murder of his wife and concurrent terms of five years for tampering with evidence (hiding her body), to run consecutive to the 99 years because the judge's findings were supported by the record and fully justified the finding that it was a premeditated offense by a dangerous offender who was likely to commit similar offenses if not confined.
       Wyatt v. State, — P.2d — (Alaska Ct. App. May 14, 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's composite sentence of 68 years for first-degree murder, second-degree assault, and fourth-degree assault was proper; the superior court analyzed the facts of the case using the appropriate criteria and the most critical factor was the fact that defendant chased the victim even after the victim had retreated from the altercation. Kone v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Oct. 31, 2018) (memorandum decision).

        Sentence not excessive. —

      <p>
       Sentence was not excessive where the trial court relied on the presentence report, defendant’s prior convictions, and the fact that he fired a shotgun through a door knowing that the victim was outside the door. The sentence was imposed in the lower range of permissible sentences based upon the absence of serious injury, and substantial reasons were given for imposing a sentence above the minimum.

        The crime of involuntary manslaughter is necessarily included in the offense of second degree murder. Jennings v. State, 404 P.2d 652 (Alaska 1965); Johnson v. State, 511 P.2d 118 (Alaska 1973).

        If a jury finds that a defendant committed an unlawful homicide and acted with recklessness, knowledge, or intent, but if the jury has a reasonable doubt as to whether the state has proved murder, then the defendant is entitled to the benefit of the jury’s doubt and must be convicted only of manslaughter, a violation of AS

        State properly established the element of “extreme indifference to the value of human life” required for conviction of second-degree murder not only through evidence of defendant’s egregiously dangerous driving, but also through evidence of defendant’s extreme intoxication, decision to ignore warnings not to drive, and past dealings with the legal system regarding his attitude toward driving while intoxicated offenses.

From the evidence, a fair-minded juror could reasonably infer that defendant’s actions in aiding and abetting the principal actor’s assault on the victim were conducted under circumstances that constituted a manifest indifference to human life.

        where the heavily intoxicated defendant drove his car on the wrong side of a divided highway for several miles, forcing several motorists to take evasive action, and apparently ignoring all warnings and attempts by other motorists to alert him to the danger that he posed. Ratliff v. State, 798 P.2d 1288 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasonable jury could have found that defendant displayed extreme indifference to the value of human life where defendant, after drinking a large number of alcoholic beverages at home and at a club, decided to drive himself and a passenger home; defendant was extremely intoxicated when he drove his car directly in front of an oncoming car on a well-lit, icy street; evidence of defendant’s prior convictions for drunk driving, and the related treatments required, showed that he had a heightened awareness that driving while grossly intoxicated was dangerous. Jeffries v. State, 169 P.3d 913 (Alaska 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction for extreme-indifference second-degree murder was appropriate under subsection (a)(2) because rational jurors could have easily inferred that the hair at issue fell from defendant while he was strangling the victim; inference could have been made that it was unlikely that the victim moved after the hair fell, which would have supported the state’s theory that the victim was strangled by defendant while they had sex and that the victim never got up after defendant had left her. Hinson v. State, 199 P.3d 1166 (Alaska Ct. App. 2008).

        While attempting to elude the police, defendant raced his vehicle into an intersection against a red light while the victim was crossing the intersection, and struck the victim at a speed estimated between eighty-four and ninety-six miles per hour. This was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of murder in the second degree because a reasonable juror could conclude that defendant knew that his conduct was substantially certain to cause death or serious physical injury.

        Defendant may not be convicted of murder unless the jury finds that he possessed the culpable mental state specified in either the first or the second degree murder statute.
        He is entitled to have the jury instructed to this effect, and the fact that he can no longer be convicted of manslaughter because the statute of limitations has run on that offense in no way eases the state’s burden of proof to convict him of murder.

        Jury instruction describing the test the jury was to apply in determining whether to return a verdict of guilty or not was not sufficiently misleading to constitute “plain error” which would warrant reversal. Dorman v. State, 622 P.2d 448 (Alaska 1981).

        Where eyewitnesses saw defendant and his accomplice beat a homeless man to death in an empty lot, the trial court properly instructed the jury as to accomplice liability; to convict defendant as an accomplice, the State had to show that he acted with the intent to promote or facilitate the beating.

        In a case alleging first degree murder, the State argued that defendant killed the victim by bludgeoning him with a dumbbell; however, during deliberations, the trial court gave the jury a supplemental instruction on the elements of second-degree extreme-indifference murder, and defendant was convicted of this offense. Post-conviction relief was proper where counsel failed to argue that the supplemental instruction was erroneous because it was a constructive amendment of the murder charge. Lindeman v. State, 244 P.3d 1151 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's convictions of first-degree murder and second-degree murder with intent to cause serious physical injury were reversed because it was error to deny a heat of passion jury instruction, as defendant presented some evidence of each element of that defense, since defendant told police the victim attacked defendant with a machete and defendant killed the victim immediately after being attacked, and the victim's injuries and defendant's claim defendant blacked out and woke up standing over the victim's body holding a machete supported an inference defendant was in the throes of emotion and out of control when defendant attacked the victim.

        Defendant’s sentence was vacated because the trial court misapplied the Court of Appeals of Alaska’s Gustafson decision when it concluded that defendant’s intentional assault on the officer meant that the resulting homicide was automatically equivalent to blameworthiness to first-degree murder and therefore he should presumptively receive the 99-year maximum sentence.

        <i>
         Page
        </i>
        benchmark range applied only to second-degree murders that arose from intentional assaults.

        Trial court properly rejected defendant's proposed mitigator under subsection (d)(3) because it applied only to cases governed by presumptive sentencing, and defendant was convicted of second-degree murder, which was not governed by presumptive sentencing; because the aggravating and mitigating factors applied only by analogy, the trial court's authority to consider the mitigating factor was not affected by whether it was proved by clear and convincing evidence.

        Trial judge was not clearly mistaken when imposing a sentence of 65 years’ imprisonment for second-degree murder and a composite sentence of 72 years to serve for all of defendant’s crimes, where defendant raped and killed a victim and then took up residence in her cabin and ate her food while the community was looking for her.

        Where defendant was convicted of murder in the second degree, his sentence of 85 years was not excessive even though his co-defendants received lighter sentences; the sentencing judge found that defendant was the primary actor, he acted with deliberate cruelty, tortured the victim, and had an extensive prior criminal record. His co-defendants did not have a similar criminal history, and received leniency for agreeing to accept responsibility and to testify.

        In a case in which defendant was sentenced to 60 years' imprisonment for second-degree murder, he was not entitled to a sentence in the benchmark range of 20 to 30 years for a typical first felony offender convicted of a typical second-degree murder because he was not a first felony offender; and the superior court found that he had an extensive criminal history, he had demonstrably poor prospects for rehabilitation, he was dangerous and unpredictable, and a lengthy term of incarceration was necessary to protect the public.

       </p>
       <p>
        All intentional killings unless legally excused or mitigated to manslaughter are first-degree murder under the new code, and felony murder, which is second-degree murder, does not currently require an intent to kill. Carman v. State, 658 P.2d 131 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).

       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction for felony murder was reversed because the state failed to establish the necessary causal connection between the commission of the predicate felony, in this case arson, and the commission of the homicide.
        The state may not extract felony murder as an included crime merely under the combined succession of a homicide and a predicate felony.
        Hansen v. State, 845 P.2d 449 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant convicted of felony murder was not entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser included offense of manslaughter because the jury convicted defendant of the felony of robbery. Under the circumstances, it would have been irrational for the jury to acquit defendant of felony murder.
        Smith v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Apr. 15, 2009) (memorandum decision).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant convicted of felony murder was not entitled to a jury instruction on self-defense because he was also convicted of robbery, and there was no evidence that he withdrew from the robbery and was subsequently unlawfully assaulted by the murder victims. Therefore, the defense of self-defense was not available.

         Separate convictions and punishments for felony murder and underlying felony. —

       </p>
       <p>
        The Alaska Constitution allows separate convictions and punishments for felony murder and the underlying felony, even though, under Alaska’s cognate approach, the underlying felony may be a lesser included offense of felony murder. Todd v. State, 884 P.2d 668 (Alaska Ct. App. 1994), aff'd, 917 P.2d 674 (Alaska 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature intended to allow multiple punishments for felony murder and the predicate offense of robbery. Todd v. State, 917 P.2d 674 (Alaska), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 966, 117 S. Ct. 391, 136 L. Ed. 2d 306 (U.S. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Felony murder and robbery are not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes; therefore, consecutive sentences are allowable. The statutes differ significantly in the intent and conduct required; the most obvious difference is the requirement under the felony-murder statute that someone have been killed. Todd v. State, 917 P.2d 674 (Alaska), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 966, 117 S. Ct. 391, 136 L. Ed. 2d 306 (U.S. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The double jeopardy clause of the Alaska Constitution does not separate convictions for second-degree (felony) murder and the predicate offense of first-degree robbery. Todd v. State, 917 P.2d 674 (Alaska), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 966, 117 S. Ct. 391, 136 L. Ed. 2d 306 (U.S. 1996).

       <p>
        Clearly Alaska law calls for separate convictions and punishments when the victim of the homicide is someone other than the victim of the underlying felony, as when a bystander or a police officer is killed during a robbery; but even when the defendant’s crimes involve only one victim, the Alaska legislature intended to authorize separate convictions and punishments for the underlying felony and the resulting homicide. Todd v. State, 884 P.2d 668 (Alaska Ct. App. 1994), aff'd, 917 P.2d 674 (Alaska 1996).

        , two things are apparent: first, even in the situation described in the statute (a burglary committed for the purpose of killing someone) when the felony-murder rule does not apply, the legislature still envisioned the defendant might be separately convicted of murder (first-degree murder) or manslaughter and the underlying burglary; second, because the legislature enacted a special provision to merge the two potential offenses in this specific situation, the legislature must have intended that defendants in other felony-murder situations would be subject to conviction and punishment for both the homicide and the underlying felony.

        Heat of passion. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding in felony-murder prosecution that defendant did not act in self defense did not preclude heat of passion defense.
       Kirby v. State, 649 P.2d 963 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on heat of passion because the evidence at defendant's trial did not constitute "some evidence" of serious provocation; there was no evidence in the record to support a finding that the victim assaulted her daughter because the origin of the daughter's injuries went unexplained;
       Lopez v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 8, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Insufficient evidence of “heat of passion” to warrant instruction. Martin v. State, 664 P.2d 612 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1007, 104 S. Ct. 1001, 79 L. Ed. 2d 234 (U.S. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Victim’s preexisting anger did not in itself support a reasonable inference that his killer acted in a heat of passion after being seriously provoked by victim. Hilbish v. State, 891 P.2d 841 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasonable person standard set forth in subsection (f)(2) governs the determination of whether that provocation was “by the intended victim,” as required under subsection (a). Howell v. State, 917 P.2d 1202 (Alaska Ct. App. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       To place the heat of passion defense in issue, a defendant need only produce “some evidence” to support it and so long as some evidence is presented to support the defense, matters of the credibility of conflicting witnesses is left to the jury. Howell v. State, 917 P.2d 1202 (Alaska Ct. App. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a first-degree murder case where two brothers were arguing over drugs and money, a heat of passion instruction was not required; the victim’s belligerent words did not constitute the kind of serious provocation that would have caused a reasonable person to lose self-control to the point of shooting the victim several times in the head and the back. Undisputed evidence showed that defendant acted deliberately; he was preparing to assault the victim even before the victim uttered the words that supposedly triggered the passion. Wilkerson v. State, 271 P.3d 471 (Alaska Ct. App. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the heat of passion statute declared that the defense applied only to charges of first-degree murder and charges of second-degree murder, defendant could only claim heat of passion with respect to one of the murder charges against him; since defendant was indicted for first-degree murder, the heat of passion defense potentially applied to that charge. Luch v. State, 413 P.3d 1224 (Alaska Ct. App. 2018) (memorandum decision).

       , i.e., causing the victim's death while engaging in conduct manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life. Luch v. State, 413 P.3d 1224 (Alaska Ct. App. 2018) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by failing to instruct the jury on the defense of heat of passion because there was insufficient evidence defendant was subjected to a serious provocation; the fact that, several months before the shooting, defendant had good reason to believe his wife was having an affair did not mean that he was experiencing a “serious provocation” when he could not find her where he expected her to be, and defendant never claimed that he had personal knowledge of his wife's adultery. Luch v. State, 413 P.3d 1224 (Alaska Ct. App. 2018) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an attempted murder conviction, the trial judge erred by failing to grant the request for a jury instruction on heat of passion as it was at least reasonably possible that the victim attacked defendant with a knife, and that his overwhelming emotion was engendered by that attack because defendant testified that the victim attacked him with a knife and that, as a consequence, he went into defense mode and blacked out, leaving him with no memory of events until the police arrived; and the evidence of defendant's frenzied attack on the victim, as well as the number of people and the kind of force that was required to subdue him, supported an inference that he was in the throes of emotion and out of control when he stabbed the victim. Horton v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. May 23, 2018) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's convictions for first-degree murder and second-degree murder with intent to cause serious physical injury were reversed because it was error to deny a heat of passion jury instruction; defendant presented some evidence of each element of that defense, since defendant told police the victim attacked defendant with a machete and defendant killed the victim immediately after being attacked, and the victim's injuries and defendant's claim defendant blacked out and woke up standing over the victim's body holding a machete supported an inference defendant was in the throes of emotion and out of control when defendant attacked the victim. Cottam v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Nov. 20, 2019) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court's error in denying defendant's request for a heat of passion jury instruction did not affect the validity of the conviction for extreme indifference second-degree murder because heat of passion was not a defense to extreme indifference murder. Cottam v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Nov. 20, 2019) (memorandum decision).

       , a defendant cannot establish “serious provocation” by relying on the cumulative effect of acts and events which, as a matter of law, do not qualify as provocations. Dandova v. State, 72 P.3d 325 (Alaska Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The father’s act of purchasing a new vehicle could not as a matter of law constitute adequate provocation for homicide or attempted homicide under AS
       <cite class="ocak">
        <a href="#t11c41a01s11.41.115" target="_self">
         11.41.115
        </a>
       </cite>
       . The purchase of the vehicle was a lawful act, it was not directed at the mother, and it was not intended to influence her actions or emotions, despite the fact that the mother stated that seeing the father getting out of his new vehicle and walking to his attorney’s office reminded the mother of how the father had obtained a judgment against her and had executed on her assets, so that she was left poor while he could afford a new vehicle. Dandova v. State, 72 P.3d 325 (Alaska Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rationale of allowing a heat of passion defense is that a person who commits murder in response to serious provocation is less blameworthy, and assumedly less of a danger to society, than a typical murderer. This same rationale applies equally to a person who attempts but fails to kill in response to serious provocation. Dandova v. State, 72 P.3d 325 (Alaska Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       When mother observed physical evidence suggesting that the father had sexually abused their child, this might have constituted provocation adequate to mitigate an ensuing homicidal assault on the father; however, this incident occurred years before the mother’s attempted murder of the father, thus, as a matter of law, the mother could not rely on this incident as adequate provocation for her act of shooting the father, because any reasonable person would have cooled. Dandova v. State, 72 P.3d 325 (Alaska Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother’s phone call from her attorney’s paralegal that trial court’s custody order recommended that mother pay a portion of child’s counseling expenses, which mother misunderstood to mean that the father declared he was too poor to bear, could not be categorized as provocation under the heat of passion defense of AS
       <cite class="ocak">

       because the statute expressly stated that hearsay reports of the victim’s conduct could not constitute serious provocation. Dandova v. State, 72 P.3d 325 (Alaska Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although defendant convicted of first-degree murder claimed that his jury was improperly instructed on the heat-of-passion defense by the trial court’s failure to explain the term “proportionality,” the absence of the definition did not amount to plain error because “proportionality” is a common term with no special legal meaning in the context in which it was used.
       Leng Moua v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Jan. 4, 2012) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prisoner was precluded from bringing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim for failure to raise a “heat of passion” defense where that issue had already been ruled on in his first petition for post-conviction relief, and was not raised in his second petition.
       Hall v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Nov. 21, 2012) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on defendant's heat-of-passion defense, and therefore his second-degree murder conviction was vacated; he presented some evidence that he acted in the heat of passion based on fear, some evidence of serious provocation, and an insufficient opportunity to cool in the immediate aftermath, as he testified that the victim threatened to shoot him the day before and then again at the mall while his hand was on the butt of a gun.
       Gray v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Mar. 6, 2019) (memorandum decision).

        Serious provocation. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant showed no plain error when a prosecutor mischaracterized serious provocation in closing because (1) the misstatements were only a few sentences in an entire rebuttal argument focusing on whether defendant was in the throes of passion when defendant shot the victim, and (2) the jury was correctly instructed on heat of passion and serious provocation and to disregard any argument contrary to the facts or the law.

       The legislature did not intend to make “extreme emotional disturbance” a defense to murder. Martin v. State, 664 P.2d 612 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1007, 104 S. Ct. 1001, 79 L. Ed. 2d 234 (U.S. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       As commonly defined, “passion” is sufficiently broad to encompass a range of emotions including fear, such that, in the absence of specific, narrowing statutory language, the heat of passion defense should be broadly interpreted to include emotions other than just rage or anger. LaPierre v. State, 734 P.2d 997 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The state bears the burden of disproving heat of passion once the accused has presented “some evidence” on the issue. LaPierre v. State, 734 P.2d 997 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).

       Trial judge’s failure to include “in the defendant’s situation” in the part of the heat-of-passion instruction describing a reasonable person as someone who was mentally healthy, was not plain error because the term “reasonable person” was referred to in three other places, twice in the same jury instruction and again in a separate instruction defining that term.

        Person provoking difficulty thereby forfeits right to self-defense.

       This doctrine has been extended to preclude a person who commits a felony from claiming self-defense not only to the intended victim of the felony, but also as to any person intervening in an attempt either to prevent the crime or to apprehend the criminal. Gray v. State, 463 P.2d 897 (Alaska), limited, Wilson v. State, 473 P.2d 633 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the defendant commits a felony which includes an immediate threat of violence, he has created a situation so fraught with peril as to preclude his claim of self-defense to any act of violence arising therefrom.
       This holding is limited to the situation where the armed robbery is still in progress and where there is grave danger of violence, injury, or loss of life because a weapon is being used to consummate the felony. Gray v. State, 463 P.2d 897 (Alaska), limited, Wilson v. State, 473 P.2d 633 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       A person who commits an armed robbery forfeits his right to claim as a defense the necessity to protect himself against the use of excessive force by either the intended victim of the robbery or by any person intervening to prevent the crime or to apprehend the criminal, absent a factual showing that at the time the violence occurred, the dangerous situation created by the armed robbery no longer existed.

       The Alaska Constitution allows separate convictions and punishments for felony murder and the underlying felony, even though, under Alaska’s cognate approach, the underlying felony may be a lesser included offense of felony murder.

       Clearly Alaska law calls for separate convictions and punishments when the victim of the homicide is someone other than the victim of the underlying felony, as when a bystander or a police officer is killed during a robbery; but even when the defendant’s crimes involve only one victim, the Alaska legislature intended to authorize separate convictions and punishments for the underlying felony and the resulting homicide.

       , two things are apparent: first, even in the situation described in the statute (a burglary committed for the purpose of killing someone) when the felony-murder rule does not apply, the legislature still envisioned the defendant might be separately convicted of murder (first-degree murder) or manslaughter and the underlying burglary; second, because the legislature enacted a special provision to merge the two potential offenses in this specific situation, the legislature must have intended that defendants in other felony-murder situations would be subject to conviction and punishment for both the homicide and the underlying felony.

       Although the State offered no motive for defendant’s attack on the victim and defendant was bleeding from a wound to his thigh when the police stopped his car, under all of the evidence, any argument that defendant acted in self-defense or as a result of serious provocation by the victim would have been based on pure speculation, and defendant’s request for jury instructions on self-defense and heat of passion were properly denied.

        Offense is included in the greater charge of murder.

      <p>
       Heat of passion manslaughter was properly determined to be a lesser-included offense of second-degree murder where justification was a disputed factual element distinguishing second-degree murder from manslaughter. Blackhurst v. State, 721 P.2d 645 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       An indictment for first degree murder is sufficient to embrace involuntary manslaughter. United States v. Barbeau, 92 F. Supp. 196, 12 Alaska 725 (D. Alaska 1950), aff'd, 193 F.2d 945, 13 Alaska 551 (9th Cir. Alaska 1951).

      <p>
       Involuntary manslaughter is necessarily included in the offense of second degree murder. Johnson v. State, 511 P.2d 118 (Alaska 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on the facts of a given case both second degree murder and manslaughter could be lesser included offenses to first degree felony murder. Gieffels v. State, 590 P.2d 55 (Alaska 1979).

        <a href="#t11c41a01s11.41.110ol1a2" target="_self">

       ) sufficiently distinguishes that offense from manslaughter so as to satisfy the requirements of equal protection. Neitzel v. State, 655 P.2d 325 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       State properly established the element of “extreme indifference to the value of human life” required for conviction of second-degree murder, and not simply the “recklessness” required for conviction of manslaughter, not only through evidence of defendant’s egregiously dangerous driving, but also through evidence of defendant’s extreme intoxication, decision to ignore warnings not to drive, and past dealings with the legal system regarding his attitude toward driving while intoxicated offenses. Jeffries v. State, 90 P.3d 185 (Alaska Ct. App. 2004), aff'd, 169 P.3d 913 (Alaska 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutory phrase “under circumstances not amounting to murder in the first or second degree” does not constitute an element of the offense of manslaughter under this section; rather, this language means that a manslaughter conviction should be entered unless the jury concludes that the unlawful homicide is not just a manslaughter, but rather constitutes a murder. Edwards v. State, 158 P.3d 847 (Alaska Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Distinction between first degree murder, second degree murder, and manslaughter. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The offenses of first degree murder, second degree murder, and manslaughter all require the same physical act, the unlawful killing of a human being.
       The difference is in the mental state of the perpetrator. Padie v. State, 557 P.2d 1138 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska legislature has intended manslaughter to be a residual category of unlawful homicide, encompassing any unlawful killing done with recklessness, knowledge, or intent, unless the state proves that the killing constitutes first- or second-degree murder. Edwards v. State, 158 P.3d 847 (Alaska Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a jury finds that a defendant committed an unlawful homicide and acted with recklessness, knowledge, or intent, but if the jury has a reasonable doubt as to whether the state has proved murder, then the defendant is entitled to the benefit of the jury’s doubt and must be convicted only of manslaughter under paragraph (a)(1) of this section; however, the fact that the jury may believe that there is a reasonable possibility, or even a likelihood, that the defendant’s conduct constituted murder does not entitle the defendant to be acquitted of manslaughter. Edwards v. State, 158 P.3d 847 (Alaska Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Criminally negligent homicide distinguished. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Criminally negligent homicide is not the same as manslaughter based on recklessness under the relevant statute since recklessness requires conscious disregard of a known risk, while in contrast, the essence of criminal negligence is failure to perceive the risk. Edgmon v. State, 702 P.2d 643 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a given defendant did not perceive a risk because he or she was mentally retarded, because he or she had bad eyesight or bad hearing, or because his or her experience had not fitted him or her to appreciate the risk would be irrelevant in proving negligence but highly relevant with regard to recklessness, whether the given individual was intoxicated or not, and consequently, elimination of intoxication as a basis for a finding that a specific individual did not appreciate a specific risk does not totally destroy the distinction between criminal negligence and recklessness. Edgmon v. State, 702 P.2d 643 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The sole distinction between recklessness and criminal negligence — and, by extension, between manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide — lies in the accused’s awareness of the risk that is caused by the accused’s conduct. Panther v. State, 780 P.2d 386 (Alaska Ct. App. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Involuntary manslaughter is not a lesser crime than voluntary manslaughter.
       </b>
       Des Jardins v. State, 551 P.2d 181 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no statutory distinction in Alaska between voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. La Londe v. State, 614 P.2d 808 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Second degree arson and manslaughter considered separate offenses. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the second degree arson statute protected a property interest while the manslaughter statute protected the paramount personal interest of protection of human life, they should have been considered separate offenses for double jeopardy purposes. Jacinth v. State, 593 P.2d 263 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Only one statutory crime. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       There was only one statutory crime of manslaughter in Alaska, although it was defined in two statutes, former AS 11.15.040 (manslaughter) and former AS 11.15.080 (negligent homicide). Des Jardins v. State, 551 P.2d 181 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        For cases construing former culpable negligence statute,
       </b>
       Giles v. United States, 144 F.2d 860, 10 Alaska 455 (9th Cir. Alaska 1944); United States v. Barbeau, 92 F. Supp. 196, 12 Alaska 725 (D. Alaska 1950), aff'd, 193 F.2d 945, 13 Alaska 551 (9th Cir. Alaska 1951).

       <b>
        Statute of limitations. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       While there is no statute of limitations in Alaska for the offense of murder, the crime of manslaughter is subject to a five-year statute of limitations. Padie v. State, 594 P.2d 50 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant’s waiver of the relevant statute of limitations was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered; it was made for defendant’s benefit and after consultation with counsel; and defendant’s waiver did not contravene any of the policy reasons underlying criminal statutes of limitations, the superior court possessed jurisdiction to accept defendant’s plea of nolo contendere to the charge of manslaughter after the statute of limitations had run. Padie v. State, 594 P.2d 50 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Use of a dangerous instrument
       </b>
       is not necessarily an element of manslaughter, even though it is safe to assume that the vast majority of manslaughter cases will involve the use of an object or implement that falls within the definition of a dangerous instrument. Krasovich v. State, 731 P.2d 598 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of a dangerous instrument is characteristic of manslaughter, and the automobile is a dangerous instrument characteristically used in committing the offense. Krasovich v. State, 731 P.2d 598 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).

       Defendant was properly convicted of manslaughter because a jury could reasonably conclude that defendant voluntarily and actively participated in an assault on the victim with conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the assault would result in the victim’s death. Defendant held the victim down while an accomplice wearing gloves with plastic knuckles punched him several times and hit him in the forehead with the butt of his handgun, killing him. Floor v.

       Where defendant was charged with first degree murder and the statute of limitations had run on the lesser offense of manslaughter, while the jury should not be instructed that they might find defendant guilty of manslaughter, defendant was entitled to an instruction on the mitigating effects of passion and provocation, requiring the jury to acquit him if he presented such evidence in mitigation and the state did not negate it. Padie v. State, 557 P.2d 1138 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court did not err in instructing the jury that it had to unanimously acquit defendant of manslaughter before it could consider a lesser-included offense — negligent homicide. Dresnek v. State, 718 P.2d 156 (Alaska), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1021, 107 S. Ct. 679, 93 L. Ed. 2d 729 (U.S. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       In prosecution for drunk driving manslaughter and second-degree assault, the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that if it found that there was .10% or more alcohol in defendant’s blood at the time of the accident, it could infer that he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Dresnek v. State, 718 P.2d 156 (Alaska), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1021, 107 S. Ct. 679, 93 L. Ed. 2d 729 (U.S. 1986).

       Jury instruction given on the relationship between intoxication and recklessness, challenged for the first time on appeal, was not plain error. Adams v. State, 718 P.2d 164 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant convicted of first-degree murder claimed the trial court erred in failing to give a proper instruction on the lesser-included offense of manslaughter, premised on the fact that the manslaughter instruction given to the jury referred only to reckless homicide and did not inform the jury that knowing and intentional homicides may qualify as manslaughter, this claim must fail if defendant has suggested no theory under which the evidence might have supported a conviction of manslaughter based on intentional or knowing conduct. Ridgley v. State, 739 P.2d 1299 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the jury was given a proper lesser-included offense instruction on murder in the second degree, but nevertheless convicted defendant of murder in the first degree, given the jury’s rejection of second-degree murder as a lesser-included offense, it is evident that defendant suffered no prejudice, even assuming a manslaughter instruction he challenged was inadequate. Ridgley v. State, 739 P.2d 1299 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal from a conviction of manslaughter, it was held that the trial court erred by including, in its instruction on presumption of innocence, that such presumption was not intended to prevent the conviction of any person who is in fact guilty, or to aid the guilty to escape punishment. Reynolds v. United States, 238 F.2d 460, 16 Alaska 502 (9th Cir. Alaska 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is error for a trial judge to take the wording of the manslaughter statute and import it wholesale into a jury instruction on the elements of manslaughter because jurors should not be told that the offense of manslaughter requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a killing was neither first-degree, nor second-degree murder, as that is not an element of manslaughter. Rather, manslaughter is a residual category of unlawful homicide that applies if the government fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a homicide was murder. Clark v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Jan. 6, 2016) (memorandum decision).

       Counsel was not incompetent for failing to request a jury instruction on the lesser offense of third-degree assault under

       In a case where defendant was convicted of manslaughter, first-degree assault, and driving under the influence arising from a collision between a snowmobile and a dog sled, a trial court properly allowed the State to introduce evidence of defendant’s cocaine use prior to the collision because it was relevant to prove that defendant acted recklessly and was under the influence. The State presented expert testimony that cocaine was a stimulant and that it could cause a person to be inattentive, to have difficulty with complex, divided-attention tasks such as driving, and to engage in aggressive, risk-taking behavior.

       The addition of five years of suspended imprisonment to a five-year presumptive term for drunk-driving manslaughter was not clearly mistaken, where the aggravating factor for increasing the sentence was defendant’s decision to operate a motor vehicle after having consumed enough intoxicating liquor to raise his blood-alcohol level to almost twice the legal maximum.

        Manslaughter distinguished. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Criminally negligent homicide is not the same as manslaughter based on recklessness under the relevant statute since recklessness requires conscious disregard of a known risk, while in contrast, the essence of criminal negligence is failure to perceive the risk. Edgmon v. State, 702 P.2d 643 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a given defendant did not perceive a risk because he or she was mentally retarded, because he or she had bad eyesight or bad hearing, or because his or her experience had not fitted him or her to appreciate the risk would be irrelevant in proving negligence but highly relevant with regard to recklessness, whether the given individual was intoxicated or not, and consequently, elimination of intoxication as a basis for a finding that a specific individual did not appreciate a specific risk does not totally destroy the distinction between criminal negligence and recklessness. Edgmon v. State, 702 P.2d 643 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The sole distinction between recklessness and criminal negligence — and, by extension, between manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide — lies in the accused’s awareness of the risk that is caused by the accused’s conduct. Panther v. State, 780 P.2d 386 (Alaska Ct. App. 1989).

        Standard of care. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is constitutional for the legislature to specify a single standard of care for criminally negligent homicide, even when the defendant is a young adult under the age of 25, or even a teenager as young as 16; jurors found that defendant acted with criminal negligence precisely because she did not appreciate the substantial and unjustifiable danger to her mother’s life, and defendant was properly held to an adult standard of care when the jury assessed whether she acted with criminal negligence in causing the death of her mother. Waterman v. State, 342 P.3d 1261 (Alaska Ct. App. 2015).

       The state, in a criminal case under former AS 11.15.080, was not required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant’s negligence was the sole proximate cause of the death. Wren v. State, 577 P.2d 235 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a defendant negligently created a risk of death to another person, the fact that the person actually died as a result of the combination of that negligence plus some other contributing factor did not serve to exculpate. Wren v. State, 577 P.2d 235 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       A decedent’s conduct might be considered under former AS 11.15.080 insofar as it had a bearing on the defendant’s alleged negligence.
       Negligence of the deceased might also be considered with reference to the issue of whether the defendant’s culpable negligence had been the proximate cause of death. Otherwise, any negligence of the deceased was irrelevant. Wren v. State, 577 P.2d 235 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The crime of negligent homicide is established upon proof that the accused was driving while intoxicated and that such act was the proximate cause of death. Lupro v. State, 603 P.2d 468 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is sufficient evidence that the driver was intoxicated at the time of the accident, the state need only show beyond a reasonable doubt that the intoxication was the cause of the victim’s death. Lupro v. State, 603 P.2d 468 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to prove that defendant was guilty of criminally negligent homicide in failing to provide her 21-month-old child with medical care after he had been struck in his abdomen, the state needed to prove not only that defendant had acted with criminal negligence in failing to obtain medical treatment but also that her criminally negligent failure to obtain medical treatment was a legal or proximate cause of his death. Pinkerton v. State, 784 P.2d 671 (Alaska Ct. App. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a defendant is charged with criminally negligent homicide, one of the elements the State must prove is that the defendant failed to perceive a risk of human death that was substantial and unjustifiable — of such a nature and degree that the failure to perceive it constituted a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation. Waterman v. State, 342 P.3d 1261 (Alaska Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for criminally negligent homicide because the jury could have concluded that defendant's actions were a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would have observed in using equipment not suitable for diving—specifically, a compressor not designed to create breathable air, an air hose that was too narrow, the wrong type of oil for the compressor, and a poorly maintained filter—when the victim died from carbon monoxide poisoning while diving with defendant.

        Reckless vs. criminally negligent. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       To be reckless, a person must be aware of and consciously disregard a risk, while a person is criminally negligent if he or she fails to perceive, and, therefore, disregards the risk in question.
       When a defendant is intoxicated and, therefore, unaware of a risk, the state is still obligated to prove that the defendant, given his faculties, his education, his experience, and his intelligence, would have perceived that risk but for his intoxication.

       Allowing the prosecutor to cross-examine a psychiatrist by reference to defendant’s prior convictions for driving while intoxicated was not an abuse of discretion, where defendant, by putting his mens rea directly in issue through the witness’s expert testimony, opened the witness up to cross-examination about the basis for his opinion.

       Indictment which in negligent homicide charge stated that defendant did unlawfully, by culpable negligence, kill a child by striking the child with his hands with excessive force and violence, was supported by the evidence although the pathologist who examined the infant told the grand jury that death resulted from a “blunt force injury of some kind” to the head, and no evidence showed that defendant ever struck the child on the head, since a “blunt force injury to the head” does not necessarily require a blow to the head itself; the term “striking,” as used in the indictment was not limited to a blow or a punch, but might include other forms of violent physical conduct, and the grand jury testimony established that defendant had severely spanked the child and then bounced him against the floor.

         Constitutional considerations. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Alaska or federal constitutions did not preclude defendant’s conviction of first-degree assault, a class A felony, even though the same conduct under the same circumstances could have resulted in his conviction of second-degree assault, a class B felony. Hart v. State, 702 P.2d 651 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Constitutional error held harmless. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial judge erred in having defendant take the stand and testify, as defendant was having obvious difficulty in understanding the law and deciding whether to testify; while this was constitutional error, it was harmless, as the defense conceded that defendant, a convicted felon, shot his mother, which supported his weapons misconduct conviction, plus he acted at least recklessly when he shot his mother, and there was no reasonable possibility that the jury would have reached a different verdict on the first-degree assault charge. Alvarez-Perdomo v. State, 425 P.3d 221 (Alaska Ct. App. 2018), rev'd, 454 P.3d 998 (Alaska 2019).

        <b>
         Assault not continuing offense. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Assault is not typically regarded as a continuing offense. S.R.D. v. State, 820 P.2d 1088 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Series of unrelated assaults over two-year period. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Repeated assaults, which were interspersed over a period of approximately two years, and constituted separate criminal episodes, encompassed a series of fourth-degree assaults, none of which could be deemed aggravated in itself, and were insufficient to support a conviction for assault in the first degree. S.R.D. v. State, 820 P.2d 1088 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Self-defense. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In an assault case in which the defendant admits the assault, but raises self-defense, specific instances of the victim’s prior conduct are considered to be admissible under Evidence Rule 405(b) to show (1) who was the aggressor, in which case defendant’s knowledge of the incident is immaterial; and (2) that defendant acted reasonably in using the degree of force he did, in which case defendant must know of the victim’s past acts of violence. Amarok v. State, 671 P.2d 882 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant, who claimed his stabbings of two men was in self-defense, stabbed one only once in the arm, but stabbed the other three times in the back, including two deep wounds to the chest that collapsed the lungs, the jury might have concluded that the severity of his attack on the first was warranted by the circumstances but that the additional severity of his attack on the second was not necessary and was therefore not legally justified. State v. Walker, 887 P.2d 971 (Alaska Ct. App. 1994).

        Although defendant argued that the trial court erred in rejecting defendant’s objections to a medical expert’s testimony, and that the trial court also erred in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal on a robbery charge, the appellate court did not have to resolve these issues because they were moot. The trial court merged the robbery verdict and the verdicts on the various counts of felony assault into a single conviction for first-degree assault, and the trial court sentenced defendant only for first- degree assault.

        It was no error not to merge assault and weapons misconduct convictions because the first-degree assault statute concerned armed violence against individual victims resulting in serious harm, while the weapons misconduct statute concerned injury to one or more persons or property damage.

        Even though defendant’s two assaults may have occurred in quick succession, his separate conviction for first-degree assault was justified by the fact that he, after kicking his wife in the head, picked up a new weapon (a beaver snare) and commenced a different sort of physical attack on his wife.

        Testimony of witnesses varied significantly in relation to the circumstances surrounding a knife fight where the defendant stabbed the victim several times and caused significant injury to the victim’s hand. Conviction under this section was proper because the jury weighed the evidence and rejected defendant’s self-defense claim.

        Trial court, inter alia, properly convicted defendant of kidnapping and first-degree assault because he demanded that his long-term partner (the victim) get into the car with him, bound her hands and feet, and refused to allow her to leave the home to seek medical assistance for two days, defendant was on notice from the grand jury presentation that the State would be relying on evidence that he bound the victim's arms and legs to support the kidnapping charges, a unanimity instruction was not so obvious that any competent judge or attorney would have recognized it given the way the case was litigated, and the State proved that the binding was more than “incidental” to the accompanying assault.

        In a case where defendant was convicted of manslaughter, first-degree assault, and driving under the influence arising from a collision between a snowmobile and a dog sled, a sentence of 19 years, with 15 years to serve, was not clearly mistaken because the trial court carefully considered the relevant sentencing criteria; defendant had prior contact with the juvenile court, had committed another felony after these offenses, and defendant had taken positive steps towards improvement.

       <p>
        In determining whether a victim has sustained a serious physical injury, it is far more appropriate to evaluate the nature of the injuries inflicted rather than the individual victim’s physiological response to that injury. James v. State, 671 P.2d 885 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983), rev'd, 698 P.2d 1161 (Alaska 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court properly allowed presentation of evidence concerning the statistical risk of injuries such as those suffered by defendant’s victim, and this evidence was sufficient to allow the question of serious physical injury to be submitted to the jury. James v. State, 671 P.2d 885 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983), rev'd, 698 P.2d 1161 (Alaska 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The victim’s broken jaw, which had to be wired shut for six weeks, constituted a “serious physical injury”; evidence of this injury established sufficient protracted impairment of a body member or organ to permit a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant’s assault constituted first-degree assault. Walker v. State, 742 P.2d 790 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant stabbed the victim, he caused serious physical injury under (a)(1). There was medical testimony that when the victim was brought to the hospital she faced an appreciable and significant risk of death. The fact that she was lucky and survived did not negate the fact that the wound created a substantial risk of death.

        Evidence showed that defendant knocked the victim to the ground with his truck, caused her head to hit the pavement, and then drove over her ankles with both axles, causing injuries which required the victim to walk with pain on crutches for at least two months. This was a serious physical injury under subsection (a), and defendant’s truck was properly considered to be a dangerous instrument.

        Superior court properly convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict of first-degree assault under and first- and second-degree weapons misconduct because the statements by witnesses at the residence and 911 callers showed that multiple gunshots were fired into the air and toward one victim's house and the men standing in front of it, hitting the second victim, two cars, and penetrating the kitchen wall, and the jury could have reasonably found that these circumstances created a substantial risk of death Mataafa v.

       <p>
        Superior court properly convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of first-degree assault because defendant repeatedly punched a store employee in the face and head as he attempted to stop defendant from stealing knives from the store, the employee's testimony about the scope of his injuries and his prognosis was sufficient to support the conclusion that he suffered both "serious and protracted disfigurement" and "protracted impairment of health," the jury, using everyday experience, could reasonably find a causal relationship without expert assistance, and the inconsistencies between the victim's grand jury and trial testimony did not amount to a fatal variance.

        The requirement of a “dangerous instrument” in paragraph (a)(1) of this section serves to define the surrounding circumstances from which intent is normally inferred. Wettanen v. State, 656 P.2d 1213 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement of a dangerous instrument in paragraph (a)(1) of this section serves to shift the focus of the trier of facts’ attention from the result (physical injuries), which in any given case may have been unforseeable to the defendant at the time the assault was committed, to the manner in which the assault was committed.
        Thus, the defendant is protected against a finding of first-degree assault in which the jury determines guilt solely by finding serious physical injury and then inferring an intent to cause that serious physical injury from the injuries alone. Wettanen v. State, 656 P.2d 1213 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        While feet are not dangerous instruments per se, they may become so, however they are shod, if used in such a way as to be capable of causing death or serious physical injury. Wettanen v. State, 656 P.2d 1213 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury could properly conclude that defendant’s action of kicking victim several times in the head while victim was lying helplessly on the ground made defendant’s foot a dangerous instrument, and that such manner of using his foot was “capable of causing death or serious physical injury”, sufficient to support a conviction. Davidson v. State, 975 P.2d 67 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant used his foot as a dangerous instrument because it suggested that defendant kicked the victim in a particularly violent manner. The victim described defendant's kicks as those of a martial arts expert and were aimed at the face or upper chest, defendant was a professional physical trainer, he had a significant age and size advantage over the victim, and he admitted that he studied taekwondo.

        Speeding driver crossed the median, hitting another car and injuring its occupants. His blood alcohol level was in excess of .2.

        Because the first-degree and third-degree assault charges stemmed from a continuous course of conduct, merger was required. The blows were not clearly separate in time, and the evidence did not reflect a change in purpose, impulse, or provocation.

       <p>
        State was properly allowed to introduce evidence that defendant had previously tried to engage in “fisting” (tried to insert his entire hand into a woman’s vagina) because it was relevant to defendant’s identity as the perpetrator of the charged violent fisting. Defendant waived any attack on a finding that fisting was an uncommon practice.

       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which defendant was convicted of first-degree assault of a three-year-old child, the trial judge did not abuse her discretion when she ruled that the testimony of the child's doctors was admissible under Daubert because the doctors engaged in a process of differential diagnosis that entailed examining the child's injuries and symptoms, evaluating those injuries and symptoms in light of her medical history, and running various tests to investigate potential causes of her injuries and symptoms; the doctors described how they reached a diagnosis of physical abuse only after they had affirmatively ruled out other potential explanations as being inconsistent with the child's physical condition, test results, and medical history.

        Evidence which established that defendant had kicked victim several times in the head while victim was lying helpless on the ground, which demonstrated the nature of the kicks for the jury and characterized them as “a full kick”, and which included victim’s testimony of the extent of his injuries, was sufficient to support the jury’s finding that injury was “caused by an act performed under circumstances that create a substantial risk of death”.

       Defendant's convictions for second-degree assault and third-degree assault were appropriate where the defendant pulled out a flare gun, held it to the victim's neck, and fired it during an argument outside of a bar. Although the trial court should have given a jury instruction clarifying the definition of a “dangerous instrument,” defendant's flare gun was a dangerous instrument as it was used in a manner that created a substantial risk that the victim would suffer serious physical injury.

       Defendant was properly convicted of second-degree assault because his thumb qualified as a “dangerous instrument” where he used, or attempted to use, it in a manner that rendered it capable of gouging out a police officer's eye.

       Defendant’s assault on the victim was not justified where there was no violence or threat of violence until defendant cut the victim in the face with a knife, whereupon defendant threatened to kill the victim twice. A reasonable person would not conclude that any force, even nondeadly force, was necessary to defend the attacker against the victim. Silvera v. State, 244 P.3d 1138 (Alaska Ct. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to disprove defendant’s claim of self defense and convict him of second-degree assault because the evidence showed that defendant did not tell the witnesses there was a knife involved when he was confronted during the assault on the victim; he did not mention a knife during his 15-minute interview with police a short time after the assault; the first time that defendant claimed that a knife was involved was during his testimony at trial; and defendant described a fairly large knife — one with a six-inch blade — which would be difficult to overlook, but the witnesses did not see the victim with a knife, nor did the police find a knife when they arrived at the scene.

       Defendant was properly convicted of second-degree assault because, even without a special instruction on the use of hands as a “dangerous instrument,” given the manner in which the case was litigated and argued to the jury, the jury would have understood that it was being asked to decide whether defendant had used his hands in a manner that actually created a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to his wife; Defendant was trained in martial arts, straddled his wife, grabbed her chin with one hand and the back of her head with the other, and forcefully twisted her neck.

       Although defendant was allowed to attack the victim’s credibility, the evidence regarding the physical assaults was strong as an officer stated the victim’s injuries were consistent with strangulation, and defendant’s injuries were consistent with a struggle between two individuals; and the value of the evidence that the victim lied about being assaulted in order to cover up a drug transaction was diminished as the victim was the one who initiated contact with the police.

       Defendant’s conviction of assault for physical abuse of a three-year-old girl was reversed where the trial court erred in admitting the testimony concerning the girl’s out-of-court statements; the statements were not admissible as excited utterances where the evidence did not show that the child was emotionally engulfed by the situation, either inferentially from the time and circumstances, or actually from the statements of the witnesses; and the child did not testify at trial and no showing was made as to her unavailability. The child’s statements made to a doctor identifying the defendant as the child’s assailant, furthermore, were inadmissible because they were not sufficiently related to diagnosis or treatment.

       Although the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of defendant’s prior assaults on his girlfriend, it was an abuse of discretion to admit evidence of defendant’s assaults on a prior girlfriend; that evidence did go to show defendant’s tendency to become very angry in domestic situations, and to threaten violence, but the state had available much more relevant evidence to establish this character trait.

       Where defendant grabbed the victim’s arm and jerked his torso into defendant’s truck, holding him there while he punched the victim in the face with enough force to fracture his facial bones in three places and causing bleeding in two areas around his brain, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that defendant struck the victim with a dangerous instrument sufficient to cause death or serious physical injury.

       Defendant was properly convicted of third-degree assault for recklessly inflicting physical injury by means of a dangerous instrument (strangling his girlfriend with his hands) because defendant offered nothing to show that the denial of his request for a continuance prejudiced the preparation of his defense or his rights, defendant failed to show that the superior court abused its discretion in denying his discovery request, the evidence of defendant’s prior assaults were properly admitted as directly relevant, more probative than prejudicial, and any potential for unfair prejudice could be adequately handled by a cautionary instruction, and the prosecutor’s closing argument about defendant’s failure to testify was not plainly erroneous.

       Defendant’s convictions for second-degree assault and third-degree assault were appropriate. Defendant drew a flare gun, held it to the victim’s neck, and fired it, during an argument outside a bar; athough the trial court should have given a jury instruction clarifying the definition of a “dangerous instrument,” defendant”s flare gun was a dangerous instrument as it was used in a manner that created a substantial risk that the victim would suffer serious physical injury.

       Evidence was legally sufficient to convict defendant of third-degree assault because the officer was aware that defendant had recently threatened to kill law enforcement; when the officer asked defendant if he had any weapons, defendant informed him that he had a gun, and then proceeded to reach down and touch the gun despite the officer telling him not to; defendant placed the gun on the dashboard but refused to get out of the car; officers had to resort to pepper spray to get defendant out of the car and under arrest; and a fair-minded juror could find that the officer reasonably feared imminent serious physical injury by means of a dangerous instrument and that defendant acted recklessly with regard to that fear.

       Jury properly convicted defendant of attempted first-degree murder, third-degree assault, first-degree harming a police dog, and felony failure to stop at the direction of a peace officer because the evidence, that defendant shot and killed a police dog, and fired multiple rounds in the direction of the two officers, was sufficient to conclude that defendant intended to kill the officers.

       Sufficient evidence supported defendant's assault convictions where the victims' testified that they saw defendant wielding his revolver when he first began to pursue them and he opened fire on them with that revolver. Defendant's actions in aggressively pursuing the victims with his revolver visibly drawn were sufficient to prove that he had recklessly placed them in fear of serious physical injury,

      <p>
       A first offender should normally receive a more favorable sentence than the presumptive term for a second offender, but the supreme court, in applying this rule, focuses on the period of actual incarceration, excluding suspended periods of imprisonment; so where defendant received only one year of unsuspended imprisonment, since the presumptive sentence for a second felony offender convicted of assault in the third degree is two years, his sentence did not violate the rule. Lee v. State, 760 P.2d 1039 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).

      <p>
       Sentence of defendant with no prior criminal convictions to consecutive terms of four years with one year suspended and one year with six months suspended for two second-degree assaults and to a concurrent term of one year with nine months suspended for a third-degree assault, a composite term of five years with one and one-half years suspended was more favorable than the corresponding second offense presumptive term for the individual offenses and was not excessive. Splain v. State, 924 P.2d 435 (Alaska Ct. App. 1996).

      <p>
       For a first felony offender convicted of third-degree assault, a sentence of five years with one year suspended (four years to serve), which exceeded the three-year presumptive term for a third felony offender, was not excessive based upon aggravating factors in the facts of the case, and by defendant’s history of repeated serious violence against the same victim.

       Defendant’s conviction for assault in the third degree was vacated where, apart from the victim’s testimony that defendant’s hand was in a fist when he struck her, there was nothing in the record to establish that the manner in which he used his hands was inordinately violent or particularly calculated to inflict serious physical injury. Konrad v. State, 763 P.2d 1369 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the prosecutor erroneously asserted that the State did not need to prove that the officer's fear was reasonable, the trial court did not take steps to ensure that the jury properly understood the applicable law, the reasonableness of the officer's fear was a disputed issue at trial, and the jury might have convicted defendant under the erroneous impression that he could act recklessly even if the jury found that the officer's fear was unreasonable, defendant's conviction for third-degree assault was reversed.

      <p>
       Trial court erred in instructing the jury on a dictionary definition of "threat," rather than the statutory definition, and his third-degree assault conviction was reversed; the legal definition of "threat" is not debatable, as it is clearly set out in statute and case law. The jurors asked multiple questions about the legal definition of "threat," thus demonstrating confusion, and the error was prejudicial, as the question of whether the statements constituted threats was contested at trial.

       A defendant who victimizes two or more people by a single assaultive act commits a separately punishable assault for each victim; likewise, a single act of recklessness that kills two or more people constitutes a separately punishable manslaughter for each victim. Thus, even if an assault on a bar employee had arisen from exactly the same act as the assault and killing of another bar employee, it still would constitute a separately punishable crime under Alaska law.

      <p>
       A sentence of five years and nine months with three years suspended for multiple convictions, the most serious of which was assault in the third degree, was not excessive where the presentence report emphasized that the defendant had a history of assaults on active duty police officers and where the sentencing judge stated that the defendant’s behavior of totally losing control of himself and engaging in dangerous and assaultive behavior was a consistent pattern and that he was a “dangerous person” for whom rehabilitation was very guarded.

       Trial court did not impose an excessive sentence following defendant’s conviction of numerous counts of assault stemming from two separate incidents because the trial court found that defendant repeatedly used his airplane to try to frighten other guides and hunters away from his camps and intentionally used his airplane to make the victims fear that he was going to hit them. The judge noted that defendant had done this even though a client was in the back seat of his airplane and concluded that defendant’s actions could easily have caused a fatal accident; it was also significant that defendant committed the assaults on two separate occasions on different groups of hunters.

      <p>
       It was error not to award a personal representative attorney's fees because his well-pleaded allegations satisfied the elements of assault in the fourth degree; the allegations of the complaint fit the statutory definitions of “assault in the fourth degree” and “physical injury” because the complaint alleged that a hospital employee caused an elderly woman physical injuries and harm, and the testimony at trial generally supported those allegations.
       Haines v. Comfort Keepers, Inc., 393 P.3d 422 (Alaska 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding that defendant's conduct caused physical injury to the victim for purposes of defendant's fourth-degree assault; while defendant pointed to various reasons why the jury might have found that the physical injury element was not proven, the evidence had to be viewed in a light most favorable to the jury's decision, and the evidence showed that defendant choked the victim and held her head in a washing machine, and after she broke free, he chased her, caught her, and threw her to the ground.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was properly convicted of fourth-degree assault because his girlfriend sounded scared and distraught during a 911 call and seemed to be crying, and defendant's confrontation clause argument was foreclosed by the doctrine of invited error where his trial counsel repeatedly assured the trial judge that there was no confrontation problem, and defendant's claim was inadequately briefed.

       The fact that defendant simply “lashed out” violently at the victim without specifically intending to cause her injuries did not substantially mitigate the offense. State v. Huletz, 838 P.2d 1257 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for fourth-degree assault where defendant, while flying his private aircraft, swooped down on a hunting party in an effort to frighten them and to compel them to move away from his own hunting camp. Although the victim’s testimony regarding the incident was sparse, other witnesses clearly testified to the proximity of defendant’s plane to the victim and testified that defendant was warned via radio that his plane was flying too close and that he was acting dangerously.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not impose an excessive sentence following defendant’s conviction for numerous counts for assault stemming from two separate incidents where defendant repeatedly used his airplane to try to frighten other guides and hunters away from his camps, and intentionally used his airplane to make the victims fear that he was going to hit them. The judge noted that defendant had done this even though a client was in the back seat of his airplane and concluded that defendant’s actions could easily have caused a fatal accident; it was also significant that defendant committed the assaults on two separate occasions on different groups of hunters.

      <p>
       Where defendant was charged with second-degree assault for kicking the victim, there was at least some evidence to support a finding that defendant’s feet were not dangerous instruments, and because the defendant’s use of a dangerous instrument was therefore in dispute, the trial court erred in denying defendant’s request for a lesser-included offense instruction on fourth-degree assault.

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court based its verdict that defendant violated a domestic violence protective order not only on defendant’s no contest plea to assault, in which he agreed the trial court could find that he engaged in knowing conduct toward the victim, but also on the testimony at trial, which was sufficient to support the conclusion that defendant knowingly committed an assault on the victim.

      </p>
      <p>
       Charges of sexual assault in the first degree, resisting arrest, fourth-degree assault, and providing false information to a peace officer were sufficiently connected to justify joinder under Alaska R. Crim. P. 8(a)(3) because the evidence of the sexual assault was relevant to show that defendant had a motive for giving false information, resisting arrest, and assaulting an officer when the officers approached defendant 18 days later. And the evidence that defendant gave a false name and attempted to avoid arrest was correspondingly relevant to show guilty knowledge of the sexual assault. Shorty v. State, 214 P.3d 374 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue of whether the trial court erred in granting the State’s motion to join two cases against the defendant was waived when defendant did not file a pretrial motion for severance; accordingly, acquittal in one case did not impact the validity of the verdict of guilty in the second case. There was no prejudicial error by the court.
       Price v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Oct. 3, 2012) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in convicting defendant of second- and fourth-degree assault because the convictions merged with his first-degree assault conviction where the State presented its case for first-degree assault as an ongoing assault encompassing multiple acts that resulted in serious physical injury.

       Trial court did not err by allowing the jury at defendant's first trial to return verdicts on the assault and theft charges after it was unable to reach a verdict on the first-degree robbery charge because theft was not a lesser-included offense of robbery; after the trial court declared the jury hung as to the robbery count, it was proper to allow the jury to continue deliberating on the assault count and return a verdict on that crime.

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was properly convicted of second- and fourth-degree assault, second-degree failure to stop at the direction of a peace officer, and misdemeanor driving under the influence because, while the superior court should have merged his two convictions for second-degree assault, defendant's attack on his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend was unprovoked and left the boyfriend permanently disfigured, defendant failed a sobriety test, and the sentencing judge properly rejected the proposed mitigator where defendant's conduct was within the “heartland” of the definition of the offenses, his prospects for rehabilitation were “guarded,” and he had no remorse.
       Lewis v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 31, 2016) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to show that defendant committed fourth-degree assault because, although the victim's testimony was inconsistent with her prior statements, she affirmatively testified that defendant struck her leg and arm, and the jury could have credited her prior statements in which she reported that defendant struck her in the head. The jury was also able to view the victim's injuries in photographs taken on the day of the incident.

       Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of fourth-degree assault because an eyewitness testified that a smaller man was punched and thrown to the ground by a bigger man, minutes after the 911 call an officer located defendant who matched the eyewitness's description of the assailant, and defendant admitted to the officer that he fought everyone.

       Because judges (not juries) decide what a statute means, defendant’s attorney was not entitled to ask the jurors to adopt his own particular interpretation of the statutory phrase “impairment of physical condition;” thus, in a fourth-degree assault case, the trial judge did not exceed his lawful authority when he adopted his own interpretation of the phrase “impairment of physical condition.” Eaklor v.

       In prosecution for fourth-degree assault, since there was evidence from which the jury could infer that defendant believed he had to kick his uncle to prevent harm to his daughter, and that this belief was reasonable, he was entitled to an instruction on defense of a third person as justification for his conduct.

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of assault in the fourth degree at defendant’s trial for sexual assault in the first degree, where there was no evidence of a disputed fact to distinguish sexual assault from assault in the fourth degree, and a finding of guilt on the sexual assault offense would have been inconsistent with an acquittal on a fourth-degree assault charge.

       Defendant's three fourth-degree assault convictions were reversed because (1) the trial court refused to give defendant's self-defense instruction despite there being "some evidence" to support the defense, and (2) it could not be determined if guilty verdicts were based solely on injuries counsel alleged were self-inflicted.

       Defendant’s lengthy misdemeanor record and the circumstances of his reckless endangerment conviction, particularly the near miss of a pedestrian, justified the imposition of a maximum term for driving while his license was suspended and a consecutive three-month unsuspended term for reckless endangerment. Joseph v. State, 775 P.2d 519 (Alaska Ct. App. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       A total term of twenty-five years with ten years suspended was not excessive where sentence represented conviction of one class A felony (convictions of alternative counts of attempted kidnapping were merged into a single count), three class C felonies (third-degree assault), and two class A misdemeanors (reckless endangerment); this was so under the circumstances of this case, even though defendant was a first offender.

       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant or reckless endangerment where he fled from the police with a semi-automatic pistol in his hand, shedding drugs as he ran, the chase led defendant and the police through heavy traffic and then through a residential neighborhood occupied by adults and children on a Saturday afternoon, and defendant abandoned the weapon in the neighborhood creating further risk.

       Defendant was properly convicted of reckless endangerment after he accosted rafters who capsized during a river tour because trial court properly instructed jury that the portion of the river flowing through defendant’s land was a public waterway and defendant failed to present evidence that the rafters’ use of the river was a trespass.

       It was not an abuse of discretion to allow the State to present an expert witness from the State Crime Laboratory during its rebuttal case. While the defendant testified at trial that he only consumed five drinks, that he was only slightly intoxicated, and that he had a good recall of the events being litigated, the expert witness’s testimony tended to show that he consumed at least twice as much alcohol as he admitted in his testimony.

       Defendant’s motion to suppress should have been granted following arrest and refusal to submit to chemical test, because an investigative stop as a party to a reported domestic dispute, predicated on a 911 call, was not justified after that party had left the scene; there was insufficient objective basis to believe that the reported argument had led, or would lead, to a crime to justify the stop.

       Grand jury evidence was sufficient for indictment for first-degree stalking where there was a protective order in place against defendant who nevertheless made ongoing contact with victim, including numerous hang-up calls to the victim and victim’s boyfriend, paging the victim when she attended one of her boyfriend’s musical performances, and slashing tires on her and her boyfriend’s cars.

       Evidence was insufficient to convict defendant of first-degree stalking because the victim never asserted that his interactions with defendant during the weeks he had contact with defendant were anything but consensual; defendant's behavior during those weeks did not cause the victim to fear injury or death; defendant's text messages to the chief of police, who had taken the cell phone that defendant had given to the victim, did not constitute a series of non-consensual contacts with the victim as he was not even aware of defendant's text messages; and only the encounter at a store could be characterized as non-consensual contact with the victim, but one act of non-consensual contact was not enough to establish the offense of stalking.

      <p>
       In prosecution for kidnapping and murder, the jury was not instructed that, for purposes of the kidnapping charge, it was required to find an act of restraint going beyond any act incidental to victims murder; the jury instructions thus left open the possibility that the verdict of guilt on the kidnapping charge was based on the jury’s finding of an act of restraint that was integral to the conduct on which it based defendant’s conviction for murder. Therefore, the trial court properly recognized the potential violation of defendant’s double jeopardy rights and correctly declined to impose a sentence for kidnapping. State v. McDonald, 872 P.2d 627 (Alaska Ct. App. 1994).

       The crime of custodial interference was designed to protect any custodian from deprivation of his or her custody rights — even if that deprivation results from the actions of a person who also has a right to physical custody of the child; the crime does not focus on the legal status of the defendant, but rather focuses on the defendant’s actions, the effect of the defendant’s actions, and the intent with which those actions were performed. Strother v. State, 891 P.2d 214 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).

       When a child is entrusted to joint custodians, neither custodian may take exclusive physical custody of the child in a manner that defeats the rights of the other joint custodian. Strother v. State, 891 P.2d 214 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       After a mother left the country with her daughter to live in a cabin in the woods which had no electricity, and did not honor the week on/week off summer custody order, she was guilty of custodial interference in the first degree. Her actions did not justify a jury instruction on misdemeanor failure to permit visitation. There are critical differences between the two offenses, the most significant of which is that the father had custody during his on weeks in the summer, and not just visitation.

       In a prosecution for custodial interference, the trial court erred in barring the testimony of defendant’s attorney that he had advised defendant that there was a substantial doubt as to the validity of the state’s actions relating to the custody of her child since such testimony was relevant to the issue of whether defendant had the culpable mental state required for custodial interference.

      <p>
       In a prosecution of defendant for first degree custodial interference, the trial court erred when it barred defendant’s testimony; defendant, who disclaimed any reliance on the affirmative defense of necessity, was entitled to testify that he did not have the conscious objective to withhold his child for a protracted period, even if his proffered testimony did not appear plausible in the circumstances of his case.

      </p>
      <p>
       It was not clear error, in a custody case, to find a mother committed custodial interference in the first degree because, (1) at the time the mother kept the children from the children's father, the father was the children's lawful custodian pursuant to a visitation order granting the father visitation during that period, and (2) it was not clear error to find the mother intentionally kept the children from the father for a protracted period when the mother's alleged efforts to have the children board a plane were found to be for show.

       Trial court did not err in finding a lack of evidence of domestic violence in the proposed custodial household where the father’s girlfriend’s conduct as described in the protective order application and the trial testimony was not assault, custodial interference, or kidnapping, and the finding that there was no history of domestic violence by either party was not clearly erroneous.

       Portions of an email to the defendant from her attorney should not have been admitted into evidence. There was nothing in the email to suggest that the attorney was providing defendant guidance as to eluding police or furthering her crime. However, other parts of the email, related to informing defendant of a court date and attaching court documents, were not privileged. Although the protected communication part of the email should not have been admitted, it was harmless error as the prosecution did not rely upon it in arguing the case, and there was substantial additional evidence supporting defendant’s conviction.

      <p>
       Sentence of five years with three years suspended for custodial interference in the first degree, followed by a five-year suspended imposition of sentence for theft in the second degree, was not excessive, where defendant had seized his children in direct defiance of a court order and it was deemed necessary to impose a substantial suspended sentence in order to deter him from future criminal violations.

       Alaska prosecution for custodial interference, based on defendant’s act of taking his son out of the state on or about August 2, 1988, was not barred by an Arizona conviction for custodial interference on or about March 9, 1990, and based upon defendant’s act of keeping his son from the lawful custody of the son’s natural mother.

       Superior court did not err in granting a mother’s motion for sole legal and primary physical custody because its factual finding supported the conclusion that the father substantially interfered with the mother’s visitation rights, which was a substantial change in circumstances justifying a modification of the existing custody arrangement; the father took the parties’ child out of the State without informing the mother and caused the mother to miss six visitations in a row.

       Husband engaged in acts that undeniably defeated his wife’s co-extensive right of custody when he removed child to another state, left two letters telling his wife that she would never again see either him or their daughter, and for several weeks was successful in keeping both his own whereabouts and the child’s whereabouts hidden from his wife and the authorities; this conduct was sufficient to constitute that actus reus of the offense of custodial interference: the keeping of the child with no legal right to do so.

       Mother committed custodial interference, a crime of domestic violence, when the mother, who claimed concerns about the child's safety, refused to return the parties' daughter to the father's care at the end of regular weekend visitation as required by a custody order, and refused to tell the father where the child was for two days thereafter. The necessity defense was not applicable to the mother's conduct.

       It was not clear error, in a custody case, to find a mother committed custodial interference in the first degree because, (1) at the time the mother kept the children from the children's father, the father was the children's lawful custodian pursuant to a visitation order granting the father visitation during that period, and (2) it was not clear error to find the mother intentionally kept the children from the father for a protracted period when the mother's alleged efforts to have the children board a plane were found to be for show.

       If the defendant’s restraint of a victim is significant enough, that restraint can constitute the independent crime of kidnapping even though the restraint might simply be part of the defendant’s plan for committing a separate target crime. Hurd v. State, 22 P.3d 12 (Alaska Ct. App. 2001).

        There was no fatal variance between the first-degree sexual assault counts for which defendant was indicted and the second-degree sexual assault counts for which defendant was convicted the grand jury heard evidence that could potentially have supported an incapacitation “without consent” theory; defendant's preparations for trial indicated that he expected to be tried under an incapacitation “without consent” theory for at least some of the counts.

        In order to prove a violation of AS
        <cite class="ocak">
         <a href="#t11c41a04s11.41.410ol1a1" target="_self">

        , the state must prove that the defendant knowingly engaged in sexual intercourse and recklessly disregarded his victim’s lack of consent. Construed in this way, the statute does not punish harmless conduct and is neither vague nor overbroad. Reynolds v. State, 664 P.2d 621 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Construing the Revised Code and the concurrent amendments governing sentences together indicates that the legislature has not irrationally failed to distinguish between degrees of culpability; and the penalty provisions of the sexual offenses provisions of the Revised Code did not subject defendant to cruel and unusual punishment or deny him substantive due process or the equal protection of the laws. Reynolds v. State, 664 P.2d 621 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Victim’s vulnerability is not a necessary element of the offense of first-degree sexual assault; therefore, there was no error in using that as an aggravating factor. Grandstaff v. State, 171 P.3d 1176 (Alaska Ct. App. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant had a pattern of sexually abusing his stepdaughters, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that the victim was afraid of protesting his assault and that his assault was coerced. Her failure to protest did not constitute consent, and the applicability of the language in (a)(1) was clear in light of the evidence presented.
        Adams v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Mar. 28, 2012) (memorandum decision).

         Probable cause for arrest. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Police did not need a warrant to arrest defendant for sexual assault in the first degree because they had probable cause, based on the victim’s statement that she had been raped by two men, and an identification of defendant by the other man. Shorty v. State, 214 P.3d 374 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).

         Convictions for two separate offenses did not constitute double jeopardy. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>

The trial court did not err by admitting her hearsay statements to her aunt, her mother, a case worker, and a trooper.

        A jury could reasonably infer that defendant’s entering of victim’s bed naked and uninvited and fondling her breasts were “substantial steps” toward the commission of sexual assault in the first degree so as to provide sufficient evidence of attempted assault.

        Substantial evidence supported defendant’s conviction for attempted first-degree sexual assault; the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, established that defendant attacked wife and removed some of her clothing while the wife vigorously resisted.

        The trial court did not commit plain error in failing to specifically instruct the jury that defendant had to recklessly disregard a substantial risk that the victim did not consent to intercourse before he could be convicted of first-degree sexual assault. Reynolds v. State, 664 P.2d 621 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the indictment charged defendant with one count of first-degree sexual assault for sexually penetrating the victim without her consent, but did not specify which act or acts of sexual penetration formed the basis of that charge, and because, at defendant’s trial, the jury heard evidence of three distinct sexual penetrations, depending on the individual jurors’ assessment of defendant’s credibility and the victim’s credibility, different members of the jury could have come to different conclusions regarding which penetration constituted the sexual assault, and the failure to instruct the jury on unanimity constituted plain error that was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's instruction tracking the language of the intoxication defense statute was flawed because the instruction referred only to the fact that voluntary intoxication could negate an element of an offense that required that defendant intentionally cause a result, but the two charges of attempted first-degree sexual assault did not involve actual causation of a result as those charges required the State to prove that defendant intended to cause a result; thus, the jury should have been instructed that voluntary intoxication could negate an element of an offense that required that defendant intentionally cause or attempt to cause a specified result; however, that flaw was remedied by the summations of the parties.

        Convictions for attempted sexual assault in the first degree and kidnapping were reversed because of an erroneous jury instruction on sexual assault in the first degree concerning consent.

        An instruction stating in part, that “It is a defense to a charge of sexual assault in the first degree that the defendant entertained a reasonable and good faith belief based upon the totality of the circumstances that the female person voluntarily consented to engage in sexual intercourse. If from all the evidence you have a reasonable doubt whether the defendant reasonably and in good faith believed she voluntarily consented to engage in sexual intercourse, you must give the defendant the benefit of that doubt and acquit him of said charges,” is erroneous because it suggests that the culpable mental state is negligence, but the state must show that the defendant acted recklessly in determining whether the alleged victim consented to the sexual activity, and defendant’s conviction was reversed although another instruction and the prosecutor’s argument gave the correct standard. Ervin v. State, 761 P.2d 124 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of assault in the fourth degree where there was no evidence of a disputed fact to distinguish sexual assault from assault in the fourth degree, and a finding of guilt on the sexual assault offense would have been inconsistent with an acquittal on a fourth-degree assault charge.

        Given the persistence of defendant’s criminality, the proximity in time of his mutiple offenses, the extreme and increasing seriousness of his sex crimes, and the lack of any clear prospects for his deterrence or rehabilitation, the remote possibility of some future change in defendant’s behavior did not justify the substantial risk of exposing future victims to the same crimes that defendant committed on three occasions, and the virtual lifetime sentence imposed was justifiably calculated to assure that defendant would have no future opportunity to commit similar crimes.

        Sentence of three years and 10 months based upon the sentencing goal of rehabilitation was not unreasonable.

       </p>
       <p>
        Given testimony that defendant was extremely intoxicated, the jury could have acquitted him of attempted sexual assault in the first degree but convicted him of fourth-degree assault, and therefore it was error not to grant defendant’s request for a simple assault instruction. Baden v. State, 667 P.2d 1275 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since some evidence existed that might have justified the jury in finding defendant guilty of fourth-degree assault, but not guilty of first-degree sexual assault, the trial court’s failure to give a lesser-included offense instruction on fourth-degree assault required that defendant’s convictions be reversed.

        A charge of statutory rape was defensible where an honest and reasonable mistake of fact as to the victim’s age was shown. State v. Guest, 583 P.2d 836 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The charge of statutory rape was legally unsupportable unless a defense of reasonable mistake of age was allowed. To refuse such a defense would have been to impose criminal liability without any criminal mental element. State v. Guest, 583 P.2d 836 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        While, where an offender was aware he was committing an act of fornication, a mistake of fact did not serve as a complete defense, it should have served to reduce the offense to that which the offender would have been guilty of had he not been mistaken. State v. Guest, 583 P.2d 836 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under former AS 11.15.120, if an accused had a reasonable belief that the person with whom he had sexual intercourse was 16 years of age or older, he could not have been convicted of statutory rape. If, however, he did not have a reasonable belief that the victim was 18 years of age or older, he could still have been criminally liable for contribution to the delinquency of a minor. State v.

        There was no fatal variance between the first-degree sexual assault counts for which defendant was indicted and the second-degree sexual assault counts for which defendant was convicted, as the grand jury heard evidence that could potentially have supported an incapacitation "without consent" theory; defendant’s preparations for trial indicated that he expected to be tried under an incapacitation “without consent” theory for at least some of the counts.

        , on a first offender with a lengthy history of sexually assaultive conduct committed against his stepdaughters was clearly mistaken. The sentencing record did not justify the assumption that the defendant was destined to fail at rehabilitation that appeared to have been central in the decision on sentencing. There was no indication that the defendant ever resorted to violence or threats of violence, no physical injury resulted from the assaults, and the emotional and psychological injuries suffered by the victims were probably somewhat less than usual in such cases; the fact that the assaultive conduct was repeated over an extended period of time, while a significant aggravating factor, did not justify treating the defendant as a worst offender and imposing a maximum sentence.

       Where man was convicted of second-degree sexual assault under paragraph (a)(3) for engaging in sexual penetration with a woman who was so intoxicated that she was either incapacitated or unaware of the sexual penetration, the court of appeals held that the definition of second-degree sexual assault did not violate the single subject clause of the Alaska Constitution and was not unconstitutionally vague.

       Where defendant was charged with attempted sexual assault in the first degree, he was thereby assumed to have notice that he might be convicted of second-degree sexual assault because of the similarities in the elements of the two offenses, and his conviction for the latter offense did not violate due process.

        Attempt to commit sexual assault

       is a crime under Alaska law and requires that defendant, intending to engage in sexual contact with another person without regard to that person’s lack of consent, take a substantial step toward accomplishing this goal. Guertin v. State, 854 P.2d 1130 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of attempted sexual assault in the second degree; an eyewitness’s testimony, which was corroborated, was that the victim was incapacitated. Other corroborating evidence led the trial judge to the conclusion that defendant had at least attempted sexual penetration, which might not have been completed due to defendant’s obvious level of intoxication.

      <p>
       There was no fatal variance between the first-degree sexual assault counts for which defendant was indicted and the second-degree sexual assault counts for which defendant was convicted, as the grand jury heard evidence that could potentially have supported an incapacitation “without consent” theory; defendant's preparations for trial indicated that he expected to be tried under an incapacitation “without consent” theory for at least some of the counts.

      <p>
       Evidence supported conviction where it showed that defendant had to be aware that his stepdaughters were in fear of him and were too intimidated to stop or resist unwanted sexual contact. When he assaulted a sleeping stepdaughter who awoke but was afraid to protest or resist, her lack of resistance did not constitute consent.
       Adams v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Mar. 28, 2012) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial judge erred in instructing the jury on the “incapacitation” clause of the definition of without consent, because while defendant gave the victim sleeping pills, there was no evidence that she was incapacitated at the time; however, the error was harmless as the jury was correctly instructed on the legal meaning of incapacitated and could see for themselves that the evidence failed to support the prosecutor's assertion that the victim was incapacitated.
       Malyk v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Dec. 19, 2018) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instruction on the elements of second-degree sexual assault was flawed, as the list of elements failed to explicitly reiterate the requirement that the sexual contact occurred without the victim's consent; however, the flaw was cured by the prosecutor's repeated statements that the State was required to prove that defendant's sexual contact with the victim was without consent.
       Malyk v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Dec. 19, 2018) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient evidence supported defendant's second-degree sexual assault conviction because the evidence showed the coercion element of “without consent,” as a reasonable juror could find defendant's grabbing of the victim's breasts and ensuing attack were connected parts of a continuous episode and occurred without consent.

       Superior court properly convicted defendant, following a jury trial, of second-degree sexual assault for vaginally penetrating his cousin (the victim) while she was unconscious because the evidence established that the victim was incapacitated and that defendant knew that she was incapacitated—she had four to six shots of whiskey, did not remember lying down in the bed in which she woke up, did not remember the sexual assault, and never would have consciously consented to have sex with defendant. Defendant failed to explain how an error in the timing of the admission of the text messages prejudiced him, and the court engaged in a thorough review of the statutory criteria and explained in detail the reasons it imposed the sentence it did.

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of sexual assault in the second degree (sexual penetration with an incapacitated person) as the 18-year-old victim testified that she consumed four or five shots of alcohol, that she blacked out after taking the last shot, that she regained consciousness in the middle of the 34-year-old defendant having sex with her, and she immediately told him to stop once she realized what was happening; defendant had been drinking with the victim and was in a position to know that she was intoxicated; and defendant admitted to the police that the victim never verbally consented to having sex.

       To appreciate the nature and consequences of engaging in an act of sexual penetration, the victim must have the capacity to understand the full range of ordinary and foreseeable social, medical, and practical consequences that the act entails. Jackson v. State, 890 P.2d 587 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       To prove that defendant knew of victim’s incapacity, the state was not required to demonstrate absolute certainty on defendant’s part; there was substantial circumstantial evidence in the trial record to support an inference that defendant acted with awareness of a substantial probability that victim was mentally incapable. Jackson v. State, 890 P.2d 587 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the state presented no expert testimony to prove that victim was “mentally incapable” but instead, relied on the testimony of victim’s mother and on the jury’s ability to observe the manner in which victim spoke and acted, both when she testified at trial and during a videotaped pretrial police interview which was introduced at trial, defendant’s argument that, absent expert testimony, there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that victim was “mentally incapable” was unpersuasive; victim’s personal appearance before the jury and her videotaped pretrial interview with the police provided compelling evidence of her incapacity. Jackson v. State, 890 P.2d 587 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).

       When the state’s case for second degree sexual assault is based on the allegation that a conscious patient was subjected to touching that exceeded the bounds of legitimate treatment, the state must also prove that the health care worker knew that there was at least a substantial probability that the patient was unaware that the touching exceeded the bounds of legitimate treatment.

       Jury verdict of second-degree sexual assault, under subsection (a)(3)(B) and (C), was proper where there was sufficient direct and circumstantial evidence that defendant removed the victim’s clothing and had sex with her after she went to sleep, and that the defendant knew that the victim was unaware or incapacitated by intoxication.

       While the trial court erred in convicting defendant of second-degree sexual assault by prohibiting defendant's attorney from introducing evidence of the victim's bias, the error was harmless because there was no evidence that anyone threatened to report the victim to the Office of Children's Services (OCS), or that the victim was otherwise afraid of OCS involvement for any reason other than her report of the sexual assault, and defendant repeatedly apologized for sexually assaulting the victim during a monitored telephone conversation between him and the victim.

       The victim’s statement to a prosecution witness, made two or three days after the incident, that the victim’s father came into her bed while she was undressed and “did something wrong” was admissible under the first-complaint hearsay exception. Nusunginya v. State, 730 P.2d 172 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).

      <p>
       A child’s statement about the defendant’s pants was not hearsay because it was not introduced to prove the matter asserted; rather, this statement was circumstantial evidence that sexual abuse had occurred, by tending to prove that the child had seen the defendant’s penis. Sharp v. State, 837 P.2d 718 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly convicted defendant of first-degree sexual abuse of a minor because the victim's uncle observed the victim on a couch next to defendant shortly before the alleged abuse and testified that the victim's behavior after the incident indicated to him that she was scared and confused about what had happened, a video-recorded interview was properly admitted as a recorded statement by a child victim of a crime, and defendant did not argue that he was prejudiced thereby.

       Prosecution could properly present to the grand jury a child abuse victim’s statements identifying the accused which the victim made during her medical treatment, where, even if the testimony did not fall within the medical diagnosis exception to the hearsay rule, the victim’s inability to testify before the grand jury constituted “compelling justification” for presenting hearsay evidence under Criminal Rule 6(r).

       Where the state presented a substantial amount of circumstantial evidence implying that the defendant was an adult, the jury could reasonably have inferred that the defendant was 16 years of age or older, properly warranting submission of the case to the jury. Flynn v. State, 847 P.2d 1073 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction for first-degree sexual abuse of a minor under subsection (a)(1) for sexually penetrating his daughter between January 1 and December 31, 2009 because the daughter was younger than thirteen years old during more than nine months of 2009, but the prosecutor expressly told the jurors the count referred to an incident that occurred when the daughter was thirteen years old.

       Defendants’ convictions of sexual abuse of a minor in the first degree and sexual abuse of a minor in the second degree were reversed, where the trial court denied defendants’ request for a mental examination of the victims after a psychologist’s testimony had placed the children’s psychological characteristics in controversy. Anderson v. State, 749 P.2d 369 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s motion for a psychiatric evaluation of the victim, where the corroborating evidence against him was relatively slight and he failed to establish some specific ground for concluding that the victim suffered from psychological or emotional problems that might affect her veracity or have a direct bearing on some other material issue.

      <p>
       Extrinsic evidence that an alleged victim of sexual abuse had previously made false charges of sexual assault is permitted where the defendant who wishes to use the evidence obtains a preliminary ruling from the trial court that it is admissible.

      </p>
      <p>
       Admission of testimony concerning a sexual abuse victim’s prior consistent statements was reversible error, where some of the witnesses testified before the victim had even taken the stand and been impeached, and another witness was allowed to express her personal belief in the truth of the accusations that the victim made against defendant.

       Where defendant was convicted on separate sexual abuse counts alleging fellatio and masturbation, his conviction on the masturbation count was vacated in view of evidence showing that defendant could have performed the acts of fellatio and masturbation together as part of one continuous assault. Clifton v. State, 758 P.2d 1279 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).

       Two acts of sexual contact performed as part of a single transaction with a single incident of sexual penetration permit but one conviction for the most serious contact, i.e., the sexual penetration. Johnson v. State, 762 P.2d 493 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).

       Insufficient evidence supported defendant’s conviction for digitally penetrating the victim (a third-grader) under a continuing course of conduct theory because the State did not sufficiently show the frequency and timing of digital penetration, as (1) the victim’s statement that defendant “touched her” between ages four and six was insufficiently specific, (2) if another child’s statements indicated abuse during the third-grade year, the statements did not state the type of abuse, and (3) defendant gave no more specificity about the frequency of defendant’s abuse by digital penetration.

       “Residing” clause does not require proof of a permanent abode, but the term “residing” should not cover any and all instances where a child might temporarily stay in the same dwelling as an adult; however, with regard to the meaning of “reside” in this statute, an obvious error occurred when the trial judge told the jurors that it was up to them to decide what “reside” meant. Given the way the prosecutor argued this issue to the jury, the error was harmless; the victim was not just staying overnight at defendant’s house, but was living there for weeks at a time in order to fulfill a work requirement for home schooling.

       Evidence supported defendant’s conviction of attempted sexual assault in the first degree, where he brought his eight-year old stepdaughter and some syrup into a bathroom and asked the child if she would lick the syrup from his penis, and the fact that a wet drop of syrup was found on the counter supported the conclusion that he actually opened the syrup and poured some amount of it.

       There was sufficient evidence of genital intercourse to support defendant's conviction for sexual penetration, specifically genital intercourse, with his daughter when she was under thirteen years of age because the daughter testified that defendant "put it in, and then he spermed," which was an explicit assertion that sexual penetration had occurred.

       Daughter's testimony was sufficient to support the State's course of conduct theory relating to acts of sexual penetration because she testified that defendant put his penis in her vagina three or four times a month from the time she was eight until the time she was twelve; she testified where the acts occurred, the time of day they occurred, who was in the house at the time, her body position when defendant penetrated her, where he ejaculated and how he would clean it up, and who she told.

       The defendant’s continued efforts to justify his conduct as “sex education” and his only limited acceptance and understanding of the grave risks of psychological damage to children that his conduct presented led the court of appeals to conclude the trial judge was not clearly erroneous in concluding that the mitigating factor of conduct among the least serious in the definition of the offense was not established by clear and convincing evidence. S.B. v. State, 706 P.2d 695 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985); Bynum v. State, 708 P.2d 1293 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985); Yearty v. State, 805 P.2d 987 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).

       Defendant's probation conditions limiting family contact were not an abuse of discretion because (1) defendant's 218-year sentence made it unlikely defendant would be released, (2) defendant did not show sex offender treatment was unavailable, and (3) the conditions were properly limited by construing the conditions to permit contact if the family members filed a written consent and served the consent on the district attorney and the provider of any offered sex offender treatment consented in writing.

       Evidence showed that while in the victim’s bedroom defendant put his fingers slightly inside her pants and he put one hand on her ribs below her breast. There was also evidence that earlier in the living room defendant tried to kiss the victim, touched her breast, and put his fingertips inside the waistband of her pants. Kvasnikoff v.

       Since the jury was presented with testimony that defendant touched the victim "down there," that he put his hand down the back of her pants, that he used his fingers, and that he was in a position to assess the dampness of her vagina, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that defendant engaged in sexual contact with the victim and was therefore guilty of second-degree sexual abuse of a minor.

       After defendant was convicted for sexual abuse of a minor, he raised first amendment concerns related to the imposition of probation conditions that prohibited him from possessing “sexually explicit material” or entering a business that sold “sexually explicit material”; there were no findings supporting the imposition of those restrictions, and no clarification of what they meant.

       Whether the live-in boyfriend of the minor’s mother was in a position of authority was a question of fact for the jury; and because defendant assumed authority over the victim as her stepfather and primary caretaker, the jury reasonably concluded that he was in a position of authority over her for purposes of this statute.

       District court erred in applying multiple-conviction enhancement in
       18 U.S.C.S. § 2251(e) and sentencing defendant to life imprisonment because “sexual exploitation of children” as contained in § 2251 was defined within that statute as production of child pornography, and because defendant’s prior Alaska convictions concerning sexual abuse and sexual assault of minors did not require visual depiction element, they did not relate to sexual exploitation of children and could not serve as predicate offenses for purposes of enhancement.

       Defendant inserted his hand under his 16-year-old niece's clothing, and he held his hand on top of her genitals, and when his niece pulled his hand out, he grabbed her hand and held it against his penis; in both instances, defendant's conduct was legally sufficient to establish that his niece was coerced to engage in this sexual contact.

        Constitutionality of mistake of age defense. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In promulgating subsection (b), the Alaska legislature balanced society’s interest in deterring sexual abuse of minors against the policy of allowing defendants to show that they did everything reasonably possible to ascertain the age of their sexual partners; such a balancing — and, in particular, the decision to allocate the burden of proof to the defendant — is within the constitutional bounds of legislative action and does not violate the Federal Constitution’s guarantee of due process. Steve v. State, 875 P.2d 110 (Alaska Ct. App. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the defendant’s belief concerning the victim’s age is a matter of defense, not an element of the crime, the legislature can constitutionally allocate the burden of proof where it sees fit, in light of the societal interests involved; therefore, subsection (b) is constitutional. Steve v. State, 875 P.2d 110 (Alaska Ct. App. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The government’s failure to disclose the sexual relationship between the prosecutor and state trooper did not violate appellant’s right to due process of law; the disputed issue at trial was whether appellant reasonably believed that the victim was old enough to validly consent to sexual activity, and the State’s evidence on that issue did not come from the trooper or rest on his credibility.
       Thompson v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Dec. 11, 2013) (memorandum decision).

        Burden of proof in mistake of age defense. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) creates a mistake-of-age defense to relieve defendants from strict liability for sexual relations with children older than 13 and younger than 16; however, the defendant must prove this exculpatory mistake by a preponderance of the evidence. Steve v. State, 875 P.2d 110 (Alaska Ct. App. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prosecutor's improper statements implying defendant had to offer direct evidence to prove an affirmative defense of mistake of age and wrongly stating defendant offered no supporting evidence were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because (1) the indirect comments were curable by instructions, and, (2) if the jury believed defendant's witnesses, the jury could still reject the defense.

       Defendant’s convictions for two counts of online enticement of a minor were proper because the statute could be read narrowly to avoid the danger of unconstitutionality; there was no question that he intended to solicit two police officers, who were posing as 14-year-old girls, to masturbate for his own sexual gratification. Moore v. State, 298 P.3d 209 (Alaska Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convince jurors that the State had proven its case against defendant for online enticement of a minor, as he engaged in conversations with a police officer posing as a teenage girl, and defendant said he wanted to have sex with her after being told she was only 15 years old; defendant’s arguments hinged on viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to himself, but that was not the standard.

       Language of the statute requiring an offender to “solicit, entice, or encourage” a minor to engage in listed sexual activities must be interpreted to require the State to prove that the offender intended to cause or persuade the minor to engage in the listed sexual activities; the statute does not penalize advice from a family member or a medical provider.

       Defendant’s interpretation of this section under the rule of lenity, alleging that it was absurd that he was permitted to have sex with someone between the ages of 16 and 18, yet he was prohibited from photographing someone between those ages, was not persuasive; the relevant provisions simply refer to a child under 18 years of age, and do not distinguish between child pornography produced or possessed for private purposes and that intended for distribution.

       Where defendant was charged with sexual abuse of a minor, unlawful exploitation of a minor, distribution of child pornography, and possession of child pornography stemming from his sexual involvement with his girlfriend’s minor daughter, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to sever the sexual abuse charges from the pornography charges because all charges stemmed from defendant’s inappropriate relationship with the young girl and were connected.

       Defendant’s convictions for soliciting the crime of unlawful exploitation of a minor which were based on his asking victims to take off their clothes and let him photograph them were erroneous since defendant did not ask anyone else to engage in the prohibited conduct, i.e., inducing a child to engage in one of the sexual activities prohibited by this section, and thus he did not commit the crime of solicitation.

       Based on evidence showing multiple acts of aggravated indecent exposure to a minor, and failure to appear for over 15 years, conviction on four misdemeanor counts was proper. While defendant’s composite sentence could not exceed one year under the Neal-Mutschler rule, the sentencing court was permitted to impose a composite sentence of one and a half years based upon a consideration of the factors set forth in AS

       , the state alleged that defendant engaged in sexual penetration with the victim when he knew that she was incapacitated, the jury necessarily found that defendant knew that his victim was incapacitated; therefore, when the trial judge used this as an aggravating factor, defendant’s right to a trial by jury at sentencing, under

       A sleeping person can be “incapacitated” within the meaning of paragraph (2) of this section. King v. State, 978 P.2d 1278 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where three counts of the indictment charged that defendant committed second- and third-degree sexual assault and attempted second-degree sexual assault based on the allegation that the victim was incapacitated, the State presented evidence the victim had consumed a large quantity of alcohol and there was a significant gap in her memory after leaving the bar; the evidence was sufficient to show to support the counts that required proof that the victim was incapacitated.
       Kittick v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 18, 2010) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for sexual assault in the second degree because the evidence showed that a victim was incapacitated when appellant had sexual intercourse with her; the victim consumed an entire bottle of whiskey, her blood-alcohol level was .377 percent nine hours after the sexual assault, a witness testified that the victim was too drunk to be having sex, and expert testimony established that her blood-alcohol content would have been higher when the sexual assault occurred.

      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support jury’s determination that defendant engaged in sexual contact with four female clients in his work as a massage therapist; it was reasonable for the jury to find that the women were coerced by an implicit threat of imminent physical injury or kidnapping. Ritter v. State, 97 P.3d 73 (Alaska Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence which the State presented to the grand jury was insufficient to show that defendant compelled the victim to submit to sexual touching by the use of force; the evidence showed that, when defendant assaulted him, the victim was not intimidated but reacted immediately to terminate the assault, and the evidence which the State presented to the grand jury was insufficient to indict defendant for sexual assault in the second degree.
       State v. Townsend, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Sept. 14, 2011) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant had a history of sexually abusing his stepdaughters, the failure of a stepdaughter to protest when she awoke to find him assaulting her did not constitute consent. The evidence showed that defendant should have known the victim was intimidated and that sexual contact with her would thus be nonconsensual.
       Adams v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Mar. 28, 2012) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s convictions for sexual assault based on his coercion of the victim, his wife, to engage in sexual penetration and sexual contact; he used force when he carried the victim to the bedroom, removed her underwear, and engaged in sexual penetration. Joseph v. State, 293 P.3d 488 (Alaska Ct. App. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Conviction for first-degree sexual assault was reversed because certain evidence was improperly excluded at trial. Failure to present that allegedly exculpatory evidence to the grand jury did not constitute grounds for dismissal of the charges, but did entitle the defendant to a new trial. Milligan v. State, 286 P.3d 1065 (Alaska Ct. App. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Grand jury was given an accurate definition of “without consent,” including the requirement of coercion, even if the initial definition was incomplete, because the statutory definition from this section was later provided.
       Nicoli v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Feb. 20, 2013) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       During defendant’s trial for sexual assault, the court did not err in allowing the State to argue both theories of “without consent” in paragraph (8). The assertions about defendant’s conduct remained the same under either the coercion theory or the incapacitation theory; under both theories, the State alleged that he beat the victim as part of the sexual assault.
       Bernhardt v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Feb. 6, 2013) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutory definition of “without consent” differs from the common understanding of this phrase, in that the State is required to prove not only the victim’s lack of subjective consent to the sexual conduct, but also coercion.
       Kuku v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2013) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial judge erred in instructing the jury on the “incapacitation” clause of the definition of without consent, because while defendant gave the victim sleeping pills, there was no evidence that she was incapacitated at the time; however, the error was harmless as the jury was correctly instructed on the legal meaning of incapacitated and could see for themselves that the evidence failed to support the prosecutor's assertion that the victim was incapacitated.
       Malyk v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Dec. 19, 2018) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s second-degree sexual assault conviction because the evidence showed the coercion element of “without consent,” as a reasonable juror could find defendant’s grabbing of the victim’s breasts and ensuing attack were connected parts of a continuous episode and occurred without consent.
       Inga v. State, 440 P.3d 345 (Alaska Ct. App. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to uphold defendant’s conviction for first-degree sexual assault because a fair-minded juror could find that fellatio was coerced by the use of force; defendant’s act of grabbing the victim’s jaw was force beyond the bodily impact required for the act of penetration itself, and the victim testified that his actions caught her off guard and made her feel fearful and intimidated.
       Holt v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Apr. 3, 2019) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Jury was properly instructed on the statutory definition of “without consent“ in one instruction so that the jury was aware that, in the context of attempted sexual assault, without consent incorporated both the concept of the victim’s lack of subjective consent and the defendant's use of coercion. The jury was also aware, from another instruction, that the completed crime of second-degree sexual assault required proof that defendant took a substantial step toward accomplishing a sexual contact with the victim that would occur without consent.

       Sexual assault instruction omitting Alaska's non-standard definition of "without consent" was harmless error because (1) instructions were uncontested, and (2) consent was uncontested issue, as defendant denied being present.

       Evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant’s second-degree sexual assault conviction because the fact that the victim moved away from defendant — thereby ending the contact — did not negate the other circumstances which demonstrated that the touching was coerced by the use of force.

       Defendant inserted his hand under his 16-year-old niece's clothing, and he held his hand on top of her genitals, and when his niece pulled his hand out, he grabbed her hand and held it against his penis; in both instances, defendant's conduct was legally sufficient to establish that his niece was coerced to engage in this sexual contact.

       With regard to the meaning of “position of authority”, the jury was correctly instructed and informed that they could consider if defendant’s role was similar to one of the roles listed in this section. This element was met by the State because defendant and his mother were in charge of taking care of the victim and had a role substantially similar to a babysitter.

        The legislature clearly intended that anyone who used a dangerous instrument — any kind of weapon — should be liable for the aggravated offense of robbery in the first degree; beyond that, it intended that offenders who used firearms — a particularly dangerous subcategory of dangerous instrument — should further be subject to an enhanced presumptive term.

        In a case in which defendant was convicted of one count of first-degree robbery, two counts of second-degree assault, and one count of interfering with a report of a crime of domestic violence, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for first-degree robbery. Reasonable jurors could find that defendant strangled his father to compel him to write defendant a check for $200. Nagaruk v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Mar. 14, 2018) (memorandum decision).
       </p>

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of first-degree robbery because the store's manager saw defendant conceal liquor in his pants and confronted him; and defendant reached into his jacket, pulled out a can of bear spray, and then held his finger on the trigger of the bear spray while directly warning the manager to get back and that he was going to spray her; thus, he represented by words or other conduct that he was armed with a defensive weapon, a can of bear spray, and threatened to use it.

        Consent to search defendant’s room in the apartment was valid because the information given to police indicated that the witness renting the apartment had the requisite degree of authority to consent to the search, but even if the witness did not actually possess the requisite authority, the officers’ search of the bedroom was still lawful under the doctrine of apparent authority.

       </p>
       <p>
        The issue of whether the trial court erred in granting the State’s motion to join two cases against the defendant was waived when defendant did not file a pretrial motion for severance; accordingly, acquittal on one case did not impact the validity of the verdict of guilty in the second case. There was no prejudicial error by the court.

The trial court merged the robbery verdict and the verdicts on the various counts of felony assault into a single conviction for first-degree assault, and the trial court sentenced defendant only for first- degree assault.

       <p>
        In prosecution for both robbery and assault, failure to give an instruction on a lesser included offense of joyriding was not harmless error and the court of appeals therefore reversed defendants’ convictions for first-degree robbery and remanded for a new trial. Minano v. State, 690 P.2d 28 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984), rev'd in part, 710 P.2d 1013 (Alaska 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        On retrial of robbery charge, the jury was to be instructed on the lesser included offense of theft since, while theft might not technically be a lesser included offense of robbery, it was obviously closely related to both robbery and the lesser offense of joyriding; and since the jury would be instructed on joyriding, it should also be given the option of considering theft as a lesser included offense. Minano v. State, 690 P.2d 28 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984), rev'd in part, 710 P.2d 1013 (Alaska 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the cognate approach, joyriding was a lesser-included offense of robbery, since an element of robbery is the unauthorized taking or attempted taking of property; and joyriding is the unauthorized taking of a vehicle. Minano v. State, 690 P.2d 28 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984), rev'd in part, 710 P.2d 1013 (Alaska 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err by allowing the jury at defendant's first trial to return verdicts on the assault and theft charges after it was unable to reach a verdict on the first-degree robbery charge because theft was not a lesser-included offense of robbery and,
        after the trial court declared the jury hung as to the robbery count, it was proper to allow the jury to continue deliberating on the assault count and return a verdict on that crime.

        In a case where defendant was convicted of first-degree robbery, any flaw in the jury instruction was harmless because two witnesses testified that defendant saw a friend take out a gun, and saw one of the employees with his hands up; and one of the witnesses said that defendant stated that he was not leaving the battery and picked up the battery; thus, defendant committed a robbery when he formed the intent to take advantage of the opportunity created by his friend’s use of force, by taking the car battery from the immediate presence of the now-subdued store employees.

        In at least two instances involving multiple crimes of violence committed by offenders with prior felony convictions, the court of appeals approved consecutive sentences totaling 40 years of imprisonment, while holding that imposition of additional consecutive terms for probation violations was not warranted; for offenders convicted of multiple class A felonies, an unsuspended sentence of 40 years’ imprisonment should serve as an appropriate upper limit in all but the rarest and most aggravated situations.

        under this section, and on remand from the supreme court for resentencing, the superior court sentenced defendant to a 10-year sentence on the separate robbery count and 20 years on each of the four other robbery counts, the 20-year concurrent sentences being made to run consecutively to a federal five-year sentence for robbery while the 10-year sentence was made concurrent with the federal sentence, the 20-year sentences imposed by the superior court as to each of the four robbery counts were illegal sentences since defendant was indicted on, and pled guilty to, four violations of this section for which the maximum sentence was 15 years.

      <p>
       From the face of the statute it is clear that the legislature, in passing this robbery statute, intended to emphasize the fact that robbery is a crime against the person and deemphasize the theft aspects of the offense. Nell v. State, 642 P.2d 1361 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).

      <p>
       The plain language of this section does not indicate that an intent to permanently deprive the victim of the property is an essential element of the offense. Nell v. State, 642 P.2d 1361 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient evidence of intent to steal supported defendant's robbery conviction because jurors could reasonably conclude defendant searched for a tangible object defendant would have taken if defendant had found the object, despite defendant's irrational behavior, as the grabbing and rummaging defendant engaged in was sufficient evidence of force.

      <p>
       The crime of robbery is committed not only when a defendant uses force upon the person who possesses the property, but whenever a defendant uses force upon any person with the intent to prevent or overcome anyone’s resistance to the taking, or to compel any person to engage in conduct that might facilitate the taking. Thus, if defendant used force or threatened to use force against wife with the intent of preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of property from husband, he committed robbery; if defendant used a knife against wife for these purposes, then he used a dangerous instrument during the commission of the offense under AS

       Where a security officer, after monitoring defendant’s actions on a store security camera, saw defendant conceal merchandise, intercepted defendant in the parking garage where defendant used force with an intent to prevent or overcome resistance to his retention of the merchandise, defendant’s conduct supported a charge and conviction for second degree robbery under this section.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a trial for robbery and kidnapping, placing the burden to prove duress on defendant was constitutional, since the statutes as to robbery and kidnapping prohibit particular action undertaken with a particular objective, and because Alaska does not consider duress to be the negation of specific intent, duress may, consistent with due process, be treated as an affirmative defense.

       The lesser offense of third-degree theft was not a lesser included offense within the charge of robbery made pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, where defendant could have been charged with both the robbery of a pizza delivery man, and the theft of money in possession of the delivery man: The robbery consisted of the assault upon the delivery man for the purpose of taking money from his immediate presence and control, but the money he was carrying belonged to the pizza parlor, and the two offenses could have supported separate convictions.

      <p>
       Defendant’s convictions for second-degree robbery and first-degree burglary were upheld because defendant failed to show that the victim’s identification of him was the result of a suggestive procedure. The record showed that the victim recognized defendant — both his physical features and his voice — based on her previous contacts with him; when the victim spoke to her boyfriend, she identified the intruder as the son of an individual who had stayed with the victim and her boyfriend, but she could not recall the son’s name until her boyfriend prompted her with a name; and, while the victim’s boyfriend did suggest defendant’s first name to her, that was not the same as suggesting his identity to her.

       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of robbery in the second degree and theft in the fourth degree where he was clearly identified as being at the scene when the victim was hit; the victim heard someone say to get his money, and the police found items from the victim’s backpack in defendant’s car and in his residence.
       Woods v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 31, 2011) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for robbery in the second degree because defendant struck one victim in the course of taking property from the immediate presence and control of another. Defendant aided in the conduct of taking the victim’s pants.
       Bichiok v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Mar. 12, 2014) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence supported defendant’s convictions for second-degree robbery and third-degree assault because, when defendant’s accomplice stole a charity donation jar from the counter of a coffee shop and got into the back seat of defendant’s waiting vehicle, the shop owner and the owner’s child sustained minor injuries when they pursued the accomplice and fell to the ground after holding onto the vehicle for a short distance as defendant drove away in the vehicle. Gibson v. State, 346 P.3d 977 (Alaska Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case in which a jury found defendant guilty of, inter alia, two counts of second-degree robbery for hitting the victim and taking two cell phones from him, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict on the second-degree robbery count. The evidence showed that defendant inflicted bodily injury to the victim immediately following the taking, as the victim tried in vain to retrieve his phone.

        Failure to instruct on whether cocaine constitutes ‘‘property.’’ —

      </p>
      <p>
       Declining to instruct a jury if cocaine were “property” in a robbery and theft prosecution was not plain error because jurors could not reach a decision prejudicing defendant, as (1) any conclusion that cocaine was property was correct, and (2) a conclusion that cocaine was not property would benefit defendant by resulting in an acquittal.

        Instruction on accomplice liability. —

      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for second-degree robbery, even though the state’s primary theory was that the defendant struck the victim, while others took the property, it was not error for the trial court to instruct on accomplice liability since, to evaluate the defendant’s guilt, the jury necessarily had to receive instruction of the rules governing the defendant’s liability for the acts of the others in taking the property. Baker v. State, 905 P.2d 479 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).

       <b>
        Failure to instruct held harmless error. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant was charged with robbery under subsection (a) of this section, any error in failing to instruct the jury on third-degree theft, so that there would be a verdict available to them in case they believed defendant’s assertion that there had been no robbery nor kidnapping, but rather an elaborately-concocted plan by defendant and apparent victim to steal money from the apparent victim’s employer was harmless where jury rejected defendant’s version of the facts by finding him guilty of kidnapping.

      </p>
      <p>
       Upon conviction of second-degree robbery, where the defendant was a third-felony offender, eligible for a presumptive term of six years imprisonment, and two aggravating factors were found, i.e., the victim sustained physical injury and the defendant was on felony probation when he committed the crime, the court did not err in sentencing the defendant to serve an additional three years beyond a composite term of six years and 10 months to which he had been sentenced in two unrelated cases. Baker v. State, 905 P.2d 479 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant pled guilty to second degree robbery, a sentence of eight years’ imprisonment with four years suspended fell within the permissible range of reasonable sentences for the offense. Montoya v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Feb. 13, 2013) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s four-year sentence for second-degree robbery was not excessive, even though his codefendant was sentenced to two-and-a-half years, because the trial court found two aggravating factors that applied based on defendant's criminal history and defendant’s more severe sentence was justified by his more blameworthy role in the robbery. The evidence showed that defendant knocked the victim to the ground and then stomped and kicked him, breaking his ribs and his codefendant simply stood by and watched the assault and then he helped carry away the victim’s groceries and beer. Sheakley v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Feb. 5, 2020) (memorandum decision).

        Evidence supported separate charge of kidnapping. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the state presented evidence that defendant restrained the victim for thirty to forty-five minutes, a restraint that far exceeded whatever minimal restraint might conceivably be inherent in the crime of coercion, the superior court correctly denied defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the kidnapping charge. Hurd v. State, 22 P.3d 12 (Alaska Ct. App. 2001).

        Silence by means of threat.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Prosecutor suggested to the jury that it could convict defendant of coercion if it found that the victim decided not to leave the cabin or answer the phone based on what defendant had done, but this was not a correct statement of the law; to convict defendant of coercion, the jury had to find that the victim refrained from reporting the assault specifically because of defendant’s threat to kill her and her family if she did; demanding that a person be silent and then stuffing a shirt in the person's mouth, as here, is not obtaining silence by means of a threat, but is instead obtaining silence by means of force, which is a criminal offense, but not the offense of coercion.

        Attempt. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Domestic violence protective order was properly granted against a man where sufficient evidence showed that he attempted to commit the crime of coercion to get his former girlfriend to return to him because he had threatened to provide evidence to the lawyers of the girlfriend’s ex-husband regarding a custody dispute, to report her parents’ alleged marijuana operation to the police, and to report her to the Alaska Office of Children’s Services (OCS) for sexually abusing her children. The man did not establish that he reasonably believed that girlfriend’s parents were growing marijuana or that the man acted inappropriately with her children, and his threats to talk to the lawyer of her ex-husband and OCS occurred only after she told him that she did not want to be in a relationship with him. McGraw v. Cox, 285 P.3d 276 (Alaska 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       To prove that defendant was guilty of coercion, it was not enough for the State to show that the victim was afraid of defendant because he had assaulted her that night or because he had a history of assaulting her; the State had to show that the victim abstained from reporting the assault because of defendant’s specific threat to kill her and her family if she did. Because the State offered no evidence from which a juror could have made that finding, the superior court erred in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal on the coercion charge.

        Sufficiency of the evidence. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was sufficient to convince fair-minded jurors that reason-able people would take defendant’s threats of violence as true threats and not merely as forceful expressions of anti-government sentiment or political hyperbole, where at least one member of a community group feared for her physical safety and quit the group after defendant interrupted a public meeting of the group and threatened to kill the group’s members.
       Tolotta v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. July 27, 2016) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was properly convicted of coercion because he made his former romantic partner fearful that she, her current boyfriend, or one of her family members, would be hurt if she did not meet defendant at a local convenience store, and while the jury instruction at issue could have been more precise with respect to the culpable mental states, it did not prevent defendant's attorney from raising or arguing any defenses that he wished to, nor did it prevent the jurors from considering those “defenses”; the concept of knowing or deliberate action was inherent in the word “demand,” defendant openly admitted that his various statements were a “scare tactic,” and an element of an offense could be established if a person acted intentionally.

      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient evidence supported conviction for sexual assault of a child despite a lack of the victim's specific testimony of penetration because the victim's testimony that defendant followed the same routine as with other assaults involving penetration was sufficient.

       Trial court's findings on the status of the father's girlfriend as a domestic living partner when ordering the father's supervised visitation due to domestic violence against the girlfriend, consisting of criminal trespass and coercion, were insufficient because (1) the parties had to reside together to be domestic living partners, and (2) the court's findings did not determine when this status began or ended or explain how the status applied when the father was not permitted in the girlfriend's residence.

       <p>
        A person who appropriates property with intent to withhold it for so extended a period as to result in a loss of “the major portion of” its beneficial use intends to “deprive” the owner of its “benefit” within the meaning of AS
        <cite class="ocak">

        (8)(A). However, the determination of what constitutes “the major portion of” the property’s beneficial use must be assessed in economic terms and must be evaluated in reference to its expected life span. Glidden v. State, 842 P.2d 604 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>

        The trial court’s erroneous instruction to the jury that in the statutory definition of “deprive” set forth in AS

        </cite>
        (8)(A), the word “economic” did not modify the word “benefit”, constituted reversible error where the court’s response to the jury’s inquiry regarding the appropriate definition of “deprive” did not emphasize that the issue of whether the defendant intended that the victim lose the beneficial use of her property must be decided in terms of the property’s expected useful life, and not just in terms of the period of its unavailability to the victim. Glidden v. State, 842 P.2d 604 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).

         “Obtain.” —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Definition of “obtain” includes a requirement that the defendant’s exertion of control over the property was unauthorized; therefore, defendant was properly convicted of second-degree theft because his conduct of carrying items toward the exit of a retail store after going through the check-out line was inconsistent with the scope of physical possession granted to customers by the store owner. This conduct constituted the actus reus of theft. Simon v. State, 349 P.3d 191 (Alaska Ct. App. 2015).

        Indictment charging defendant with theft adequately informed him of offense with which he was charged, although it did not allege a specific theory of theft. Williams v. State, 648 P.2d 603 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).

        In a prosecution for third degree theft and issuing a bad check, it was not plain error to admit evidence of checks defendant previously wrote on a closed account because the evidence showed (1) defendant wrote the check at issue, (2) defendant’s intent to deprive the victims, and (3) defendant’s knowledge that defendant’s account was closed.

        Sufficiency of indictment. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An indictment under the former larceny section was held sufficient if as a practical matter it stated the elements of the offense clearly enough to enable the defense to prepare for trial and to plead a judgment in bar of a future prosecution for the same offense. Prejudice to the defendant was a controlling consideration. Stapleton v. United States, 260 F.2d 415, 17 Alaska 713 (9th Cir. Alaska 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       An indictment charging violation of the former section was not required to set out all those elements of the offense which must be found by the jury before they may find the accused guilty.
       It was sufficient that the necessary facts appear in any form, or by fair construction could be found within the terms of the indictment. Stapleton v. United States, 260 F.2d 415, 17 Alaska 713 (9th Cir. Alaska 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where indictment alleged a willful taking with intent permanently to deprive the owner of the property, lack of consent was implicit in the language. Stapleton v. United States, 260 F.2d 415, 17 Alaska 713 (9th Cir. Alaska 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment charging defendant with theft adequately informed him of offense with which he was charged, although it did not allege a specific theory of theft. Williams v. State, 648 P.2d 603 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Burden of proof. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden was not on a defendant under the former larceny section to prove his innocence since the burden rested upon the prosecution to establish every element of the crime of larceny to a moral certainty and beyond reasonable doubt. Karn v. United States, 158 F.2d 568, 11 Alaska 225 (9th Cir. Alaska 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the former larceny section, it was essential that the prosecution prove beyond a reasonable doubt, as an essential element of its case, that defendant took the property with the intent permanently to deprive the owner of its possession, and, furthermore, once sufficient evidence had been adduced either by defendant(s) concerning the owner’s purported abandonment of the property, it then became incumbent upon the prosecution as part of its overall burden of proof to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the property was not abandoned at the time the alleged larceny was perpetrated.
       If the property was in fact abandoned, then it was neither owned by nor in the possession of another person or entity and thus could not be the subject of a larceny. Howard v. State, 583 P.2d 827 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>

       <b>
        Possession of stolen property merely a circumstance tending to show guilt. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the accused was unable to explain his possession of recently stolen property, such possession was merely a circumstance tending to show guilt, and to instruct a jury that such evidence was prima facie proof of guilt, and, unless satisfactorily explained, may be of controlling weight, was clearly erroneous under the law of Alaska, which prohibits a judge from instructing a jury with reference to the facts. Fosse v. United States, 44 F.2d 915, 5 Alaska Fed. 580 (9th Cir. Alaska 1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Identity of property had to be shown. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It was true that actual possession of stolen property could be shown under the former larceny section, but it was equally true that the prosecution must also prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the property found in possession of the accused was, in truth and in fact, the identical property which was stolen.
       A bare assertion that property in the hands of accused was similar property or property that looked like it, was not sufficient to establish such property as the stolen property. Karn v. United States, 158 F.2d 568, 11 Alaska 225 (9th Cir. Alaska 1946).

       <b>
        Requirements as to circumstantial evidence. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where prosecution relied entirely upon circumstantial evidence for a conviction under the former larceny section, under such circumstances the evidence must not only be consistent with guilt, but inconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.
       The evidence should be required to point so surely and unerringly to the guilt of the accused as to exclude every reasonable hypothesis but that of guilt. Karn v. United States, 158 F.2d 568, 11 Alaska 225 (9th Cir. Alaska 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution under the former larceny section the evidence, while circumstantial, was clearly adequate and measured up to the standards which the court of appeals has laid down in such cases. Yoho v. United States, 202 F.2d 241, 14 Alaska 174 (9th Cir. Alaska 1953).

        Prosecution could waive felony and prosecute for misdemeanor. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       If on trial a misdemeanor (e.g., larceny) turned out to be a felony (e.g., robbery), then the prosecution could in such cases waive the felony, and prosecute only for the constituent misdemeanor, supposing the misdemeanor be proved. Perkins v. United States, 237 F.2d 857, 16 Alaska 471 (9th Cir. Alaska 1956).

        Harmless error. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Although Alaska’s aggregation statute was enacted to require proof of a single course of conduct and the state should have instructed the grand jury on this requirement, it was harmless error where the grand jurors understood that they were dealing with a related series of thefts and that the state’s theory of the case was based on the aggregated value of stolen property.

       Trial court did not err in sentencing defendant to 10 years’ imprisonment with five years suspended and ordering her to pay $300,000 restitution upon her conviction of embezzlement by an employee for money taken prior to January 1, 1980, and of theft in the first degree for money taken after January 1, 1980, the effective date for the revised criminal code. Karr v. State, 660 P.2d 450 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 686 P.2d 1192 (Alaska 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       While no violence was involved, trial court properly found that appellant’s embezzlement of $140,000 from her employer over a one-year period was among the most serious conduct prescribed by the statute and served to distinguish it from prior cases in which substantial sentences for embezzlement were disapproved, and eight-year sentence with four years suspended was not excessive.
       Brezenoff v. State, 658 P.2d 1359 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983) superseded by statute as stated in Dayton v. State, 120 P.3d 1073 (Alaska Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>

      <p>
       Sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment with five years suspended imposed upon a defendant employee convicted of embezzlement for money taken before and after January 1, 1980, the effective date for the revised criminal code, was upheld because of the exceptional magnitude and manner of the theft where a trusted employee embezzled over $356,000 in more than 50 thefts over a two-year period; the sentence facilitated reaffirmation of societal norms and deterrence.

       Although the defendant had a history of increasingly serious criminal misconduct and had persisted in offending despite a prior misdemeanor conviction in Florida and his current felony conviction, given the absence of significant past deterrent or rehabilitative efforts, and in light of a finding that the defendant may have been amenable to treatment for the psychological problems underlying his criminal behavior, the record did not support the sentencing court’s finding that the defendant could neither be rehabilitated nor deterred. The court’s imposition of a maximum sentence of 10 years based on this finding was, therefore, clearly mistaken. Keyser v. State, 856 P.2d 1170 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).

       Where a first felony offender embezzled almost four times the jurisdictional amount for first degree theft, the imposition of a relatively modest term of incarceration would not have conflicted with or impeded the court’s goal of assuring the defendant’s rehabilitation, and might have contributed to fulfilling the sentencing goals of general deterrence and community condemnation, and a sentence including a fine and community service, with a term of imprisonment suspended, was disapproved. State v. Buza, 886 P.2d 1318 (Alaska Ct. App. 1994).

      <p>
       Convictions for second-degree theft were reduced to convictions for third-degree theft where the state failed to preserve the scrap copper which was the object of the theft. Hatfield v. State, 663 P.2d 987 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly convicted defendants, a husband and wife, of third-degree assault and second-degree theft, respectively, because while many of their actions were recorded by a store's security cameras, the files did not include the footage from the parking lot where the husband drove into a customer or the wife's actions in taking merchandise, the original footage was no longer available, the evidence fully supported the judge's finding that a state trooper never had possession of the footage, defendants knew that the footage existed, and the fact that the trooper asked the store's loss-prevention employee to make him a copy of the store's footage did not turn the employee into the trooper's agent. Stamper v. State, 402 P.3d 427 (Alaska Ct. App. 2017).

      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a)(6) is interpreted to mean that a theft which would normally be of the third degree will be enhanced to a theft of the second degree if, within the preceding five years, the defendant was convicted and sentenced for one theft, then committed another theft and was convicted and sentenced for it, and then committed the current theft. Wooley v. State, 221 P.3d 12 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).

       <b>
        No change of venue.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not renew the motion for a change of venue during jury selection, and in reviewing only for plain error, none was found; the primary issue in connection with defendant's trial for forgery, theft, and felony criminal simulation was whether defendant had an intent to defraud when he presented the counterfeit checks, and the fact that many of the jurors knew defendant and the witnesses was not particularly prejudicial, as familiarity was expected in a small town, plus nothing indicated that the panel would be prejudiced against defendant.
       Kelly v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Mar. 5, 2008) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Rulings on evidence.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in refusing to admit emails sent to and from defendant after the date the bank confronted him with the fact that the checks he presented were counterfeit; the essential question was whether defendant, at the time he presented the counterfeit checks, had an intent to defraud, and his state of mind after he was confronted with the fact that the checks were counterfeit was not relevant, plus he was able to establish his defense through earlier emails that were admitted.

        Complicity. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s second-degree theft convictions because under the complicity statute the State did not have to prove that defendant committed all the thefts personally so long as he was complicit with the other two thieves; thus defendant was criminally responsible for all the thefts.
       McCourt v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Mar. 5, 2014) (memorandum decision).

        “Access device.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant who intentionally stole a purse intended to deprive the owner of all the contents of the purse although she represented that her intent was only to obtain whatever cash the purse contained. It is to be expected that a purse will contain “access devices” under (a)(7), such as debit cards or social security cards, and theft of a container encompasses all of the contents. Lawrence v. State, 269 P.3d 672 (Alaska Ct. App. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s conviction for second-degree theft of a driver’s license was reversed because a driver’s license does not qualify as an “access device”. Although a driver’s license, like an access device, might be used “to obtain property or services,” if the legislature had intended “theft of an access device” to mean “theft of an access device or an identification document,” it would have said so. The legislative intent was, at best, ambiguous, and the rule of lenity requires the definition to be construed against the imposition of criminal liability. Kankanton v. State, 342 P.3d 840 (Alaska Ct. App. 2015), aff'd, 368 P.3d 613 (Alaska 2016).

       Defendant’s contention that the term “market value” had no ascertainable legal meaning, and was thus subject to the rule of lenity, was rejected where the term had a recognized meaning at common law, i.e., the price at which the property would have changed hands in an arm’s length transaction between a willing seller and a willing buyer who were aware of the pertinent facts. Morris v. State, 334 P.3d 1244 (Alaska Ct. App. 2014).

       was affirmed where the jury heard evidence that the stolen parka had a retail price of $659.95 and that other reputable retailers were asking even higher prices for the same parka, and thus, a fair-minded juror could have reasonably concluded that the market value of the stolen parka was more than $500. Morris v. State, 334 P.3d 1244 (Alaska Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant had an itemized receipt that recited the prices attributed to the necklaces by the store, as well as information from which defendant could have researched the items' value, and thus the court rejected defendant's claim that he could not meaningfully contest the State's evidence regarding the value of the necklaces.
       Smith v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Feb. 20, 2019) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       State presented sufficient proof that the value of the property stolen equaled or exceeded $500 as the jury heard direct testimony from defendant's grandfather that the total value of the property taken exceeded $500 in 2009 when they were stolen; defendant told his grandfather that he could buy the property back from him by sending $2000 to Texas; and the jury could reasonably have concluded that defendant, in making his statements, provided sufficient evidence that the property's market value was $500 or more.

      <p>
       Definition of “obtain” includes a requirement that the defendant’s exertion of control over the property was unauthorized; therefore, defendant was properly convicted of second-degree theft because his conduct of carrying items toward the exit of a retail store after going through the check-out line was inconsistent with the scope of physical possession granted to customers by the store owner. This conduct constituted the actus reus of theft. Simon v. State, 349 P.3d 191 (Alaska Ct. App. 2015).

       Amendment to the theft indictment brought the indictment into conformity with the evidence presented, correcting what was a clerical error, defendant did not argue that he lacked notice or that he was otherwise prejudiced, and while the prosecutor did not instruct the grand jury on the specific elements of third-degree theft based on value, defendant did not contend that the third-degree theft judgment was not a qualifying conviction; the amendment was upheld.

       In a case where defendant was convicted of second- degree theft, the trial court erred in admitting evidence of a prior conviction for third-degree theft because identity was not in issue in the case; it was not offered to prove intent as defendant's attorney argued a defense to the actus reus of the crime of theft (taking goods without paying) rather than to the mens rea element (intent to deprive); there was no overarching scheme; and defendant made no claim of mistake. However, the error was harmless because the State's case against defendant was overwhelming; thus, the erroneous admission of defendant's prior shoplifting conviction did not appreciably affect the jury's verdict.

In his closing argument and rebuttal the prosecutor focused primarily on defendant’s own prior convictions for crimes of dishonesty and on the ways that defendant’s testimony and version of events was not credible because defendant had tried to negotiate a higher fee for cashing the check when he realized that the check was for $900, and his behavior at the bank and his willingness to abandon his identification demonstrated consciousness of guilt.

       Defendant was properly convicted of attempted second- and third-degree theft because the facts did not establish a statutory mitigator where he lied to a teller that the issuing bank assured him that the account held sufficient funds to cover the check, he presented no evidence as to the circumstances under which he received the check, whether he was the one who filled it out, why the particular amount was chosen, and whether he had access to the other stolen checks.

       Given defendants’ exemplary backgrounds, and the fact that they were convicted of class C felonies, the court was not required to impose the equivalent of at least 90 days in jail; however, the court was required to sentence defendants to some period of incarceration in order to emphasize the criminal nature of their acts; a sentence which does not require some period of incarceration would send the message that white-collar criminals who commit major theft offenses are able to avoid incarceration.

      <p>
       Where defendant was prosecuted for theft on the theory that he was legally accountable for the conduct of his 20-year-old mentally retarded daughter, the trial court committed reversible error in taking judicial notice of the “fact” that defendant’s daughter was not mentally culpable for the crime of theft and then advising the jury that they must accept this fact as conclusively proven.

      </p>

       Although troopers gave a rifle and wine found with the defendant back to the property owner after photographing the items, this action did not constitute a failure to preserve evidence for which forensic testing would have produced exculpatory evidence.

       In a case in which defendant was convicted of third-degree theft for stealing money from a wallet during an Easter service at a rescue mission, the police were under no duty to collect or preserve a video that recorded the theft.

       The issue of whether the trial court erred in granting the State’s motion to join two cases against the defendant was waived when defendant did not file a pretrial motion for severance; accordingly, acquittal on one case did not impact the validity of the verdict of guilty in the second case.

       Trial court did not err by allowing the jury at defendant's first trial to return verdicts on the assault and theft charges after it was unable to reach a verdict on the first-degree robbery charge because theft was not a lesser-included offense of robbery and, after the trial court declared the jury hung as to the robbery count, it was proper to allow the jury to continue deliberating on the assault count and return a verdict on that crime.

       Evidence was sufficient for the jury to convict defendant of third-degree theft where the victim, a property owner, testified that he thought three or four bottles of wine were taken from his house, and his estimate of the total cost of the wine taken was more than $50.
       Dreves v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Dec. 21, 2011) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of third-degree theft because the store's loss prevention manager testified that he observed defendant deliberately conceal merchandise and then leave the store without paying for it; he testified that he watched defendant continuously from the time she retrieved a cart until she left the store without paying for the items in the cart; and he testified that $108.49 worth of merchandise was recovered from defendant's shopping cart.
       Goodwin v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Dec. 7, 2016) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section gives adequate notice of what conduct is prohibited, an ordinary person would, at a minimum, understand that defendant's conduct, placing multiple items into a shopping cart, paying for a single item, and then attempting to leave the store with the remaining unpurchased merchandise, falls within the “hard core” of theft.

       A composite sentence of five years with two years suspended, imposed upon a first felony offender upon conviction of two counts of burglary in the second degree, one count of theft in the second degree, and one count of theft in the third degree, was not excessive, where defendant’s conviction of two separate burglaries and related thefts, and his admission of two additional burglaries and related thefts, justified a greater sentence than would a conviction of an isolated burglary and theft. Comegys v. State, 747 P.2d 554 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).

      <p>
       Sentence of six months for stealing less than $150 was not excessive where defendant engaged in calculated theft from his employer — repeatedly taking small amounts of money and covering up the missing amounts by entering false amounts in the cash register.

        Restatement of Miranda warning not required. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where police initially questioned defendant for shoplifting, the Fifth Amendment did not require that they restate the Miranda warnings after defendant admitted that he owned drugs found in his pocket; therefore, a subsequent statement about selling the drugs should not have been suppressed in a trial for second-degree misconduct involving a controlled substance. State v. Amend, 250 P.3d 541 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011).

       <b>
        Sufficient evidence.
       </b>
       Sufficient evidence of defendant’s intent to deprive a cab driver of money for his services supported her conviction for fourth-degree theft. Although defendant claimed that her failure to pay was the result of an honest dispute about the amount she owed, a reasonable jury could find that defendant did not intend to pay and that she hoped the driver would leave instead of waiting for her.
       Hartnell v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Sept. 21, 2011) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding defendant’s convictions for fourth-degree escape and fourth-degree theft, fair-minded jurors could find that the State had proved the elements of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.

        Sufficiency of evidence. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of robbery in the second degree and theft in the fourth degree because he was clearly identified as being at the scene when the victim was hit; the victim heard someone say to get his money, and the police found items from the victim’s backpack in defendant’s car and in his residence.
       Woods v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 31, 2011) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding defendant's convictions for fourth-degree escape and fourth-degree theft, the appellate court concluded that fair-minded jurors could find that the State had proved the elements of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the appellate court rejected defendant's arguments that the evidence was legally insufficient to support these convictions.

        Accomplice liability. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case in which defendant was convicted of fourth degree theft, the district court erred in including additional language in the pattern jury instruction regarding accomplice liability because defendant's case was not a case that involved the more subtle forms of abetting as the State's theory of prosecution was that defendant directly participated in the theft; however, the error was harmless as the trial focused on whether defendant actively participated in the shoplifting, the jury was otherwise properly instructed on the elements of complicity, and the jury was specifically instructed that mere knowledge and failure to report a crime was not sufficient to establish vicarious liability. Larson v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Mar. 21, 2018).

       Declining to instruct a jury if cocaine were “property” in a robbery and theft prosecution was not plain error because jurors could not reach a decision prejudicing defendant, as (1) any conclusion that cocaine was property was correct, and (2) a conclusion that cocaine was not property would benefit defendant by resulting in an acquittal.

        Separate convictions were proper for defendant’s act of stealing or receiving a stolen check, and for his attempt to negotiate the stolen check.

        Trial court properly recognized that the jury's verdict was not inconsistent when it convicted defendant of second-degree theft and acquitted him of second-degree forgery, The jury might reasonably have concluded that defendant acted with reckless disregard as to whether a check was stolen, but that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant actually knew the check was forged; defendant's failure to object to the purported inconsistency of the verdicts meant that he waived his claim, and his claim of error would fail even were it not foreclosed by his failure to object to the verdicts in the trial court.

        Reasonable people could have found that it was not reasonably possible to ascertain a fair market value for the iMac, given the significant limitations on its functionality as it was programmed for use in schools, and it was therefore proper for the trial judge to instruct the jurors in defendant's theft trial that, if the market value of the iMac could not reasonably be ascertained, the jurors were to use replacement cost as the measure of the computer's value.

       Sufficient evidence of defendant’s intent to deprive a cab driver of money for his services supported her conviction for fourth-degree theft. Although defendant claimed that her failure to pay was the result of an honest dispute about the amount she owed, a reasonable jury could find that defendant did not intend to pay and that she hoped the driver would leave instead of waiting for her.

       Defendant’s convictions for third degree theft and issuing a bad check merged because the State had to prove defendant knew his account would lack sufficient funds when the check was presented for payment; the two statutes protect the same societal value, and the crimes were based on one act.

       Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s convictions for two counts of issuing a bad check because, from the evidence presented at trial, the jury could have found that defendant knew that there was not a sufficient amount of money in the account on which the checks were drawn to pay the checks when she deposited them. Defendant also withdrew substantial amounts of cash from her account before the bank determined that the checks were not good. Delay-Wilson v. State, 264 P.3d 375 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011).

      <p>
       Defendant's conviction for writing a bad check was upheld where the victim testified that defendant had previously given him a bad check, resulting in the victim paying bank fees, the victim took the checks to defendant's bank and was told that defendant had insufficient funds in his account to cover the checks, and

        Definition of “credit card.” —

      <p>
       The same statutory definition of “credit card” governs, whether a defendant is charged with fraudulent use of a credit card or with unlawfully obtaining a credit card. State v. Morgan, 985 P.2d 1022 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).

       or uttering a forged instrument, see McCoy v. State, 491 P.2d 127 (Alaska 1971) (decided under former AS 11.25.020).

        Evidence sufficient. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant presented a check payable to himself, drawn on an account where checks had been reported stolen, and where he left the bank, leaving the check, after the teller took the check to obtain advice from the manager, a reasonable jury could conclude that the defendant likely knew the check he presented at a bank was stolen and forged.
       Davis v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Oct. 19, 2011) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       State presented sufficient evidence to support defendant’s convictions of theft, forgery, and fraudulent use of an access device; the State called the current manager of the store where the checks in question were cashed to testify, the store had a photograph of defendant, and the back of each of the checks written on the victim’s account contained a person’s signature, which was similar to the signatures from two of defendant’s records from the Division of Motor Vehicles, and contrary to defendant’s argument, the court had to view the evidence in the light most favorable to upholding the jury’s verdicts. Smith v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Sept. 24, 2014) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case in which a jury convicted defendant of second-degree theft of an access device, second-degree forgery, attempted fraudulent use of an access device, and attempted third-degree theft, the appellate court concluded that the evidence was sufficient for fair-minded jurors to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had the requisite culpable mental states for each of the charged offenses.

This section clearly contemplates situations in which the burglar enters unarmed and thereafter becomes armed. Wesolic v. State, 837 P.2d 130 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).

        Where defendant went over to his neighbor’s property to retrieve his missing dog, broke a window near the door and punched through the screen, pushing his arm through the broken window, the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction for attempted burglary, especially given that defendant threatened to “shoot anything that moved” once he gained entry into the house.

        Where defendant announced that he was planning to have sexual intercourse that evening, entered the victim’s apartment after a party, remained without her consent, and attempted to rape her, jury could conclude that defendant had entered the victim’s premises with the intent to commit a crime, and the evidence of unlawful entry was sufficient to support his burglary conviction. Moore v. State, 123 P.3d 1081 (Alaska Ct. App. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that defendant committed the crime of first-degree burglary as the jury could conclude that defendant initially entered a house with intent to steal or that when he entered the house the second time that he did so with the intent to steal or to damage the alarm system.

        Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s burglary and theft convictions. Inter alia, a neighbor across from the house where the crime occurred observed defendant repeatedly enter and leave the garage, piling stolen articles at the end of the driveway. Although the neighbor’s identification of the defendant occurred under suggestive circumstances, shortly after he had been apprehended and handcuffed, the court below had accepted the identification and there was no basis to disturb that finding on appeal.

        Defendant’s convictions for second-degree robbery and first-degree burglary were upheld because defendant failed to show that the victim’s identification of him was the result of a suggestive procedure. The record showed that the victim recognized defendant — both his physical features and his voice — based on her previous contacts with him; when the victim spoke to her boyfriend, she identified the intruder as the son of an individual who had stayed with the victim and her boyfriend, but she could not recall the son’s name until her boyfriend prompted her with a name; and, while the victim’s boyfriend did suggest defendant’s first name to her, that was not the same as suggesting his identity to her.

        A burglar’s simple possession of a firearm which is accessible for use will convert the offense to first-degree burglary, but a burglar’s possession of a non-firearm dangerous instrument will not affect the degree of the crime unless the defendant uses or threatens to use the dangerous instrument.

        Because of the case-specific, non-character relevance, the evidence that defendant committed three other residential burglaries nearly ten years before the events in the case was admissible; the prosecutor asserted that if defendant had committed residential burglaries in the past, those burglaries had a case-specific relevance to the issue of defendant intent in the case, apart from what the prior burglaries showed about defendant's character.

       Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for second-degree burglary because the bicycle storage shed at issue qualified as a “building”; the shed was a permanent structure with four walls, a roof, a floor, and a fixed entry place through which a person could enter the structure to store or retrieve the bicycles placed there by the business, and the testimony at trial established that human beings did, at times, fully enter the shed to retrieve the bicycles stored inside.

       When defendant was convicted of burglary and violating a domestic violence protective order for entering his wife's home in violation of the order, separate convictions were proper because (1) when a defendant entered a building with intent to commit a crime, and then proceeded to commit the intended crime, it was proper for the defendant to receive separate convictions for the burglary and for the ulterior crime, and (2) the unlawfulness of the entry stemmed from the order's 500-foot limit, while defendant intended to commit the crime of violating the order's no-contact provision.

       Where defendant went over to his neighbor’s property to retrieve his missing dog, broke a window near the door and punched through the screen, pushing his arm through the broken window, the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction for attempted burglary, especially given that defendant threatened to “shoot anything that moved” once he gained entry into the house.

       Superior court properly convicted defendant of second-degree burglary of a liquor store and third-degree criminal mischief because he and his accomplice were together at a friend's home shortly after the burglary, the blood on the broken glass at the store suggested that at least one of the burglars had cut himself, defendant's finger was cut and actively bleeding when the police found him, and the jurors could reasonably infer, after viewing a surveillance video, that defendant and the accomplice were the two men who burglarized the store.

       In a case in which defendant was convicted of second-degree burglary, his motion to dismiss the indictment was properly denied because the properly admitted evidence showed that defendant, while running away from the police, abandoned two bags, which contained an ice pick, a pry bar, a hammer, assorted jewelry, and paperwork belonging to people other than defendant; defendant admitted that he had been inside the building; and it was unlikely that the discrepancy between an officer’s police report and his trial testimony influenced the grand jury’s decision to indict.

       was affirmed because (1) the trial court’s finding that appellant’s confession was voluntary was supported by the evidence in that appellant was provided heat in his cell, he slept with a blanket, and appellant initiated the offer to confess if he could see his family, (2) the trial court’s refusal to allow impeachment of the State’s witness based on an unspecified crime that was committed over ten years ago was proper because appellant failed to comply with the admissibility prerequisites of Alaska R.

       Evidence was sufficient for a reasonable juror to find that defendant was the person who committed the charged crimes of burglary, theft, and criminal mischief because police officers noticed the door to a bicycle shed had been forced open, there were two bicycles on the ground nearby, and a van in the vicinity, later identified as belonging to defendant.

       A composite sentence of five years with two years suspended, imposed upon a first felony offender upon conviction of two counts of burglary in the second degree, one count of theft in the second degree, and one count of theft in the third degree, was not excessive, where defendant’s conviction of two separate burglaries and related thefts, and his admission of two additional burglaries and related thefts, justified a greater sentence than would a conviction of an isolated burglary and theft.

       An extensive misdemeanor record, covering a period of two years and highlighted by four shoplifting convictions, and multiple probation revocations, does not constitute the kind of exceptional case that would warrant a sentence for a first felony offender convicted of a property crime that exceeds the presumptive term for a second felony offender.

       Trial court's findings on the status of the father's girlfriend as a domestic living partner when ordering the father's supervised visitation due to domestic violence against the girlfriend, consisting of criminal trespass and coercion, were insufficient because (1) the parties had to reside together to be domestic living partners, and (2) the court's findings did not determine when this status began or ended or explain how the status applied when the father was not permitted in the girlfriend's residence.

       Appellant, who had been convicted of second-degree criminal trespass for boarding a fishing vessel that was registered to the victim, met the threshold standard for postconviction relief. Although it was questionable whether the federal court's findings would be directly admissible at a future criminal trial, the judgment and the testimony could be used to impeach the victim's claim of ownership and lawful possession of the fishing vessel.

       Under subsection (a), first-degree vehicle theft, it is a felony to knowingly drive, tow away, or take a car belonging to another while having no right or reasonable belief in a right to do so.

Despite the limited period of time in which defendant committed the offenses, the defendant’s record, coupled with the especially serious nature of the particular joyriding offense, i.e., that it was committed in order to perpetrate a felony, justified the sentence imposed.

        Double jeopardy. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutes which proscribe attempted murder, possession of explosives, and arson differ markedly in the conduct which they prohibit and in the specific societal interests which they seek to preserve, and multiple sentences for the three offenses do not violate double jeopardy. Machado v. State, 797 P.2d 677 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant committed arson and in doing so placed other persons in danger of serious physical injury, double jeopardy did not preclude convictions for both arson in the first degree and assault in the third degree. Hathaway v. State, 925 P.2d 1343 (Alaska Ct. App. 1996).

      <p>
       <b>
        Offense against property. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because arson is an offense against property, a defendant who was charged with setting one fire and damaging one piece of property could not be convicted of nine counts of arson which were differentiated only by the fact that each count listed a separate victim who had been placed in danger of physical injury. Hathaway v. State, 925 P.2d 1343 (Alaska Ct. App. 1996).

        Evidence sufficient. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was legally sufficient to support defendant’s arson conviction where, although largely circumstantial, it established that he and his roommate went together to an apartment complex where defendant’s ex-wife lived, they set fire to her car, and then fled the scene.
       Williams v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Mar. 18, 2015) (memorandum decision).

        Statements against interest. —

      </p>
      <p>
       In defendant’s murder-arson trial, hearsay statements of his wife and a third party implicating both defendant and his wife in the crimes were admissible as statements against interest. Porterfield v. State, 68 P.3d 1286 (Alaska Ct. App. 2003).

       <b>
        Improperly induced statements. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the police essentially told defendant that he would not be prosecuted for accidentally starting the fire, the officers offered an improper inducement for defendant’s statements, making them involuntary; therefore, the court erred in failing to suppress the statements, and since the convictions against defendant were obtained through use of these statements, defendant’s convictions were reversed.

       The criminal mischief statute’s phrase “having no right to do so or any reasonable ground to believe the person has such a right” encompasses any reasonable ground to believe that a legal justification for causing the alleged property damage existed; since subsection (a) of this section unambiguously defines the essential elements of criminal mischief to include the absence of “any reasonable ground to believe the person has such a right,” the state bears the burden of proof on this element once an issue of justification is raised. McGee v. State, 162 P.3d 1251 (Alaska 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph (a)(1) of this section defines the offense of criminal mischief to allow conviction only when property damage is intentionally caused by a person “having no right to do so or any reasonable ground to believe the person has such a right;” the statute’s plain language makes the absence of any “right” or “reasonable ground” a necessary ingredient of criminal mischief, thus requiring the state to bear the burden of proof on the issue once it is raised; to the extent that this allocation of the burden conflicts with the code’s general provision adopting necessity as an affirmative defense for the defendant to prove, the criminal mischief statute’s specific requirement would prevail by the general provision’s own terms, since the criminal mischief law would be a “statute defining the offense” in a manner that “provides exemptions or defenses dealing with the justification.” McGee v. State, 162 P.3d 1251 (Alaska 2007).

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the victim’s landlord to testify that he had estimated that it would cost approximately $4,500 to repair the damage defendant caused to the apartment building because the underlying issue was not the precise cost of the repairs, but instead whether the cost would equal or exceed $500. The landlord testified that, in his capacity as a property manager, he had made repairs to structures himself and had hired, and assumedly paid, others to make repairs for him; defendant did not dispute the landlord’s assertions concerning his knowledge and experience in this area.

      Under § 54, ch. 30, SLA 1996, references to prior convictions in subsection (a), as amended by § 6, ch. 30, SLA 1996 refer to convictions occurring before, on, or after May 16, 1996.

      Although the 2014 amendments were to have taken effect July 1, 2014 under Sec. 42, ch. 83, SLA 2014, the Governor did not sign the bill until July 16, 2014, and so the actual effective date of the 2014 amendments was July 17, 2014 under AS

       Evidence was sufficient for a reasonable juror to find that defendant was the person who committed the charged crimes of burglary, theft, and criminal mischief because police officers noticed the door to a bicycle shed had been forced open, there were two bicycles on the ground nearby, and a van in the vicinity, later identified as belonging to defendant.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s composite sentence of six months in prison for criminal mischief was not improperly imposed for the primary purpose of rehabilitation due to defendant’s mental health issues; rather, the trial court based its decision on defendant’s prior criminal history and the serious and offensive nature of the instant crime, which included spray-painting swastikas and offensive messages on several businesses.

       List of debts showed defendant’s motive to steal property, and the list of properties provided an affirmative link between his debts and the charged crimes; the State was not required to prove certain inferences in order to introduce this evidence, the jury could have made either inference, and the evidence was relevant if the jury could make either of these reasonable inferences, and the evidence was admissible.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant presented two checks for payment and was guilty of obtaining money by false pretenses and forgery, even though the separate counts for each check represented two distinct acts (the forgery of the endorsement and the presentation of the check for payment), the conduct as to each check constitutes one transaction with a single intent to defraud; therefore, duplicate sentencing is illegal. Black v. State, 569 P.2d 804 (Alaska 1977).

        Evidence sufficient. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       State presented sufficient evidence for a jury to find defendant intended to defraud an individual whose name he used when, by signing the individual’s name to the traffic ticket, he attempted to transfer all the potential liabilities for that ticket to the individual. Howard v. State, 101 P.3d 1054 (Alaska Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant presented a check payable to himself, drawn on an account where checks had been reported stolen, and where he left the bank, leaving the check, after the teller took the check to obtain advice from the manager, a reasonable jury could conclude that the defendant either intended to deprive another person of property or that he had received stolen property with reckless disregard that the property was stolen.
       Davis v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Oct. 19, 2011) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       State presented sufficient evidence to support defendant’s convictions of theft, forgery, and fraudulent use of an access device; the State called the current manager of the store where the checks in question were cashed to testify, the store had a photograph of defendant, and the back of each of the checks written on the victim’s account contained a person’s signature, which was similar to the signatures from two of defendant’s records from the Division of Motor Vehicles, and contrary to defendant’s argument, the court had to view the evidence in the light most favorable to upholding the jury’s verdicts. Smith v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Sept. 24, 2014) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case in which a jury convicted defendant of second-degree theft of an access device, second-degree forgery, attempted fraudulent use of an access device, and attempted third-degree theft, the appellate court concluded that the evidence was sufficient for fair-minded jurors to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had the requisite culpable mental states for each of the charged offenses.

      <p>
       A motion requesting that the State confer immunity on a juvenile under the theory that he was a co-conspirator in a fraudulent check scheme, and that he would (if forced to testify) identify defendant’s niece as a ringleader of the scheme, was properly denied. Dismissal of charges was denied because nothing in that proposed testimony clearly would have led to acquittal of the defendant.

      <p>
       When defendant gave the state trooper false information regarding his identity, he violated the false information or report statute; however, by signing a traffic ticket under a false name, defendant committed the additional offense of forgery. Howard v. State, 101 P.3d 1054 (Alaska Ct. App. 2004).

       <b>
        False representation held not to constitute forgery. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though defendant’s medical license application contained false assertions of fact, those false assertions did not misrepresent the identity of the person who prepared the application, and did not constitute forgery. Gottlieb v. State, 175 P.3d 664 (Alaska Ct. App. 2008).

        Prosecutor’s argument. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a second-degree theft and forgery case, the prosecutor’s argument referencing the criminal history of defendant’s friend, which was not admitted, did not amount to plain error as it was fleeting and not a significant part of the prosecutor’s overall attack on defendant’s credibility; and, in his closing argument and rebuttal, the prosecutor focused primarily on defendant’s own prior convictions for crimes of dishonesty and on the ways that defendant’s testimony and version of events was not credible because defendant had tried to negotiate a higher fee for cashing the check when he realized that the check was for $900, and his behavior at the bank and his willingness to abandon his identification demonstrated consciousness of guilt. McKinnon v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Nov. 12, 2015) (memorandum decision).

       See Dayton v. State, 598 P.2d 67 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The jury was properly instructed that they should not consider whether the defendant intended to repay the money as relevant to the question of whether the defendant intended to injure or defraud his employer by his forgery when the defendant had no authority to sign his employer’s name and knew the forged check was not genuine. Anakak v. State, 620 P.2d 693 (Alaska 1980).

      <p>
       <b>
        Jury verdicts held not inconsistent. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly recognized that the jury's verdict was not inconsistent when it convicted defendant of second-degree theft and acquitted him of second-degree forgery, The jury might reasonably have concluded that defendant acted with reckless disregard as to whether a check was stolen, but that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant actually knew the check was forged; defendant's failure to object to the purported inconsistency of the verdicts meant that he waived his claim, and his claim of error would fail even were it not foreclosed by his failure to object to the verdicts in the trial court.

        Separate convictions. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Separate convictions were proper for defendant’s act of stealing or receiving a stolen check, and for his attempt to negotiate the stolen check. The theft injured the owner of the check, but his attempt to negotiate the stolen check would have injured the bank or any other entity that honored the check.

      <p>
       Imposition of two three-year concurrent sentences with one year suspended for forging fraudulent permanent fund applications and fraudulently obtaining fund checks was affirmed where the trial judge found that the crimes were easy to commit, difficult to detect and generated a substantial income; if the defendant had been subject to presumptive sentencing, the defendant’s multiple acts of theft, which extended over a substantial period of time and required numerous separate intents to steal, coupled with generally fraudulent behavior, might have warranted referral of the case to a three-judge sentencing panel for consideration of a more severe sentence; and the defendant’s consistent pattern of deceptive behavior in dealing with former employers and with the state probation officer strongly militated against her potential for rehabilitation. Hads v. State, 727 P.2d 11 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Sentence held excessive. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant was guilty of obtaining money by false pretenses and forgery based on the presentation of two checks, the sentence of 15 years was excessive.
       The judge was clearly mistaken in imposing such a lengthy sentence. Black v. State, 569 P.2d 804 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Three-year unsuspended sentence for first-felony offender for seven counts of second-degree forgery was justified considering the offense and the defendant’s past criminal record, but the imposition of 12 years of suspended time was clearly mistaken; the total sentence should not have exceeded five years with two years suspended. Mathison v. State, 687 P.2d 930 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the defendant, a first felony offender, was convicted of one count of theft in the second degree and three counts of forgery in the second degree, she should not have received a total sentence, including consecutive increments, more severe than the presumptive term established for a third felony offender, where there was nothing in the record to suggest that a composite sentence of imprisonment, including all consecutive increments, greater than this presumptive term was needed to deter the defendant. Young v. State, 762 P.2d 497 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).

       Morrison v. State, 469 P.2d 125 (Alaska 1970), cited below, was decided under former AS 11.25.020.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Sufficiency of evidence. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant’s conviction of the crime of forgery. Morrison v. State, 469 P.2d 125 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant presented a check payable to himself, drawn on an account where checks had been reported stolen, and where he left the bank, leaving the check, after the teller took the check to obtain advice from the manager, a reasonable jury could conclude that the defendant either intended to deprive another person of property or that he had received stolen property with reckless disregard that the property was stolen.
       Davis v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Oct. 19, 2011) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Common law. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Forgery, at the common law, is the false making or materially altering, with intent to defraud, of any writing which, if genuine, might apparently be of legal efficacy or the foundation of a legal liability. Morrison v. State, 469 P.2d 125 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        What constitutes forgery. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The signing of a fictitious name to an instrument with fraudulent intent constitutes forgery. Morrison v. State, 469 P.2d 125 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The crime of forgery can be committed by signing an instrument in a fictitious or assumed name with intent to defraud, even though the statute under which the prosecution is brought makes no specific reference to the use of a fictitious or assumed name. Morrison v. State, 469 P.2d 125 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The signing of a fictitious name, with fraudulent intent, is as much a forgery as if the name used was that of an existing person.
       The public mischief, i.e., the legal tendency to defraud, is equally great in either event. Morrison v. State, 469 P.2d 125 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The essential elements of forgery
       </b>
       are (1) false making of some instrument in writing; (2) a fraudulent intent; (3) an instrument apparently capable of effecting a fraud. Morrison v. State, 469 P.2d 125 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       An intent to defraud is an essential element of the crime of forgery. Morrison v. State, 469 P.2d 125 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Intent to defraud”. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An intent to defraud is an intent to deceive another person for the purpose of gaining some material advantage over him or to induce him to part with property or to alter his position to his injury or risk. Morrison v. State, 469 P.2d 125 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Falsely”. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In regard to the word “falsely,” its definition implies that “the writing is false, not genuine; fictitious, not a true writing; without regard to the truth or falsehood of the statement it contains.” Morrison v. State, 469 P.2d 125 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        False representation held not to constitute forgery. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though defendant’s medical license application contained false assertions of fact, those false assertions did not misrepresent the identity of the person who prepared the application, and did not constitute forgery. Gottlieb v. State, 175 P.3d 664 (Alaska Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Intent to defraud particular person need not be alleged. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       At the trial of a forgery prosecution, it is considered sufficient if an intent to defraud any person or corporation is established. Morrison v. State, 469 P.2d 125 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Or proved. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not necessary for the prosecution to prove, or for the trial court to instruct, that defendant intended to defraud a particular person, or persons, or a particular corporation. Morrison v. State, 469 P.2d 125 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Offenses violating same societal interest. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial judge erred in concluding that misdemeanor forgery and obtaining a controlled substance by forgery are separate offenses which in an appropriate case permit separate sentences; the two offenses violate the same societal interest, namely the regulation of the availability of harmful drugs. Alley v. State, 704 P.2d 233 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Separate convictions. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Separate convictions were proper for defendant’s act of stealing or receiving a stolen check, and for his attempt to negotiate the stolen check. The theft injured the owner of the check, but his attempt to negotiate the stolen check would have injured the bank or any other entity that honored the check.
       Davis v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Oct. 19, 2011) (memorandum decision).
      </p>

       While the information on a trophy export tag may have been false, under subsection (a)(3), the tag was not “falsely made” where the defendant was both the ostensible and the actual maker. Brown v. State, 693 P.2d 324 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984).

       Defendant did not renew the motion for a change of venue during jury selection, and in reviewing only for plain error, none was found; the primary issue in connection with defendant's trial for forgery, theft, and felony criminal simulation was whether defendant had an intent to defraud when he presented the counterfeit checks, and the fact that many of the jurors knew defendant and the witnesses was not particularly prejudicial, as familiarity was expected in a small town, plus nothing indicated that the panel would be prejudiced against defendant.

        Derivation of section. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is derived from the federal mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (1970), and the New York scheme to defraud statutes, N.Y. Penal Law §§ 190.60(1) and 190.65(1). Moore v. State, 740 P.2d 472 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Construction. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutory language about defrauding five or more people or about obtaining $10,000 or more does not define the results of the scheme; the State is not required to prove that the defendant actually succeeded in defrauding five or more people or actually obtained $10,000 or more by fraud, but rather, the State must show that the defendant’s scheme was designed to achieve these ends and that the defendant was able to obtain at least some property or services in accordance with the scheme. Byford v. State, 352 P.3d 898 (Alaska Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Prohibited conduct. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       As defined in this section, the crime of scheme to defraud is aimed at those who engage in plans to obtain money or property from others by false pretenses or representations.
       The prohibited conduct includes any act of “engaging” in a fraudulent scheme when that act is coupled with the obtaining of at least some property in furtherance of the scheme. Moore v. State, 740 P.2d 472 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though a defendant may characteristically and repeatedly engage in schemes to defraud, this section does not define the crime in terms of a person’s criminal tendencies or aspirations; rather, it punishes the specific at or acts of engaging in an identifiable scheme to defraud. Byford v. State, 352 P.3d 898 (Alaska Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Culpable mental state. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “scheme to defraud” means a scheme intended to defraud; thus, proof of specific intent is not required. Knix v. State, 922 P.2d 913 (Alaska Ct. App. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Element of offense cannot be used as aggravator. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant was convicted for engaging in conduct constituting a scheme to defraud five or more persons, because that offense required a finding that defendant intended to defraud five or more persons, it could not be used as the aggravator for sentencing that defendant knew more than one victim was involved. Buckwalter v. State, 23 P.3d 81 (Alaska Ct. App. 2001).

       An instruction which required the state to prove that defendant “knowingly engaged in conduct constituting a scheme” did not preclude the jury from basing its verdict on proof of specific intent to defraud, even though it failed to expressly incorporate a specific intent requirement.

       Instruction that defendant was guilty if he either “intended to defraud client’s former wife or acted recklessly with regard to the purpose of the scheme or the means used to advance the scheme” was incorrect since the crime required proof that defendant acted with intent to defraud and it was not sufficient for the state to prove that he recklessly disregarded the possibility that his client was trying to defraud his wife.

       Sentence was not excessive where the active term of imprisonment, three years, was one year less than the four-year presumptive term provided for second felony offenders, and it was well within the sentencing range for a first felony offender convicted of a class B felony.

       Superior court properly denied defendant's claim for credit against his sentence for the time he spent on electronic monitoring because, while defendant's acts of forging a court order reducing his child support pre-dated his release on bail on electronic monitoring, that offense allowed him to pursue an ongoing, uncharged scheme to defraud for several months while he was on electronic monitoring.

       There was sufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict finding defendant guilty of deceptive business practices because the jurors could reasonably infer that even if defendant did not actively participate in all aspects of the deception, he was following the discussion, he was aware of the photographs that his girlfriend provided to a web developer and designer for a website, and he was aware that he had not built the cabins depicted in those photographs.

       The deceptive business practices charge warranted a separate conviction because any fraud that defendant achieved through a deceptive website would have been substantially separated in time from the scheme to defraud that was charged in the indictment; the establishment of the deceptive website was factually distinct enough from the earlier crimes to support a separate conviction.

       The fact that allegedly shoplifted grocery items, which had been photographed by store managers, were marked for sale at a particular price was strong evidence of value. Page v. State, 725 P.2d 1082 (Alaska 1986).

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s contention that the term “market value” had no ascertainable legal meaning, and was thus subject to the rule of lenity, was rejected where the term had a recognized meaning at common law, i.e., the price at which the property would have changed hands in an arm’s length transaction between a willing seller and a willing buyer who were aware of the pertinent facts. Morris v. State, 334 P.3d 1244 (Alaska Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court rejects the argument that it is always a question of law to be decided by the trial judge, not the jury whether the fair market value of particular property is reasonably ascertainable; there may be cases where, based on the evidence, reasonable people would have to agree that the property at issue had a reasonably ascertainable fair market value.

      </p>
      <p>
       There was sufficient evidence that the value of the stolen iMac computer was $500 or more and defendant's conviction of second-degree theft; there was testimony that the school district paid a discounted price of approximately $890 for the computer, it was only two years old, and the retail value was between $1,300 and $1,700.
       Bell v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Jan. 11, 2017) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       State presented sufficient proof that the value of the property stolen equaled or exceeded $500 as the jury heard direct testimony from defendant's grandfather that the total value of the property taken exceeded $500 in 2009 when they were stolen; defendant told his grandfather that he could buy the property back from him by sending $2000 to Texas; and the jury could reasonably have concluded that defendant, in making his statements, provided sufficient evidence that the property's market value was $500 or more.

      </p>
      <p>
       Because damage can be determined by cost of repair and, in turn, cost of repair can be established without determining the value of the damaged property, subsection (a), which uses market value, does not apply when the prosecution relies on evidence of cost of repair to prove the amount of damage in a criminal mischief case.

        Proof of single course of conduct. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Although Alaska’s aggregation statute was enacted to require proof of a single course of conduct and the state should have instructed the grand jury on this requirement, it was harmless error where the grand jurors understood that they were dealing with a related series of thefts and that the state’s theory of the case was based on the aggregated value of stolen property. Buckwalter v. State, 23 P.3d 81 (Alaska Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lack of a jury instruction regarding whether defendant engaged in one course of conduct for purposes of aggregating the damage to reach the $500 threshold for third-degree criminal mischief when he slashed 23 tires was error, but the error was harmless where there was no possibility that the jury would have found in defendant’s favor.

       Reasonable people could have found that it was not reasonably possible to ascertain a fair market value for the iMac, given the significant limitations on its functionality as it was programmed for use in schools, and it was therefore proper for the trial judge to instruct the jurors in defendant's theft trial that, if the market value of the iMac could not reasonably be ascertained, the jurors were to use replacement cost as the measure of the computer's value.

        “Deprive”. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “deprive,” when used in a statute or ordinance to define larceny or a larceny-type offense, means to permanently deprive.
       If “deprive” is to mean something aside from permanent deprivation, it will be modified with an appropriate adverb. Hugo v. City of Fairbanks, 658 P.2d 155 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subparagraph (8)(A), “value” and “benefit” must both be measured in economic terms.
       Just as a temporary taking of property that resulted only in the loss of sentimental value would not qualify under the definition of “deprive”, so the definition would not be met by a taking that resulted only in the loss of an abstract beneficial use whose value was purely sentimental or incapable of being quantified in economic terms. Glidden v. State, 842 P.2d 604 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court’s erroneous instruction to the jury that, in the statutory definition of “deprive” set forth in subparagraph (8)(A), the word “economic” did not modify the word “benefit”, constituted reversible error where the court’s response to the jury’s inquiry regarding the appropriate definition of “deprive” did not emphasize that the issue of whether the defendant intended that the victim lose the beneficial use of her property must be decided in terms of the property’s expected useful life, and not just in terms of the period of its unavailability to the victim.
       Glidden v. State, 842 P.2d 604 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subparagraph (8)(D) does not require proof of an intent to permanently deprive the owner, but only requires proof of one of the listed intents (to sell the property, or to give it away, or to pledge it, or to otherwise transfer an interest in the property); thus, where defendant took the victim’s firearms with the intent of pawning them, even though he intended to redeem the weapons shortly and return them to the victim, there was sufficient culpable mental state to support defendant’s convictions for theft and burglary. Champion v. State, 908 P.2d 454 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant admitted to stealing a purse and to disposing of it in a place where the owner was unlikely to recover it, the victim was deprived of all the contents of the purse, not just the cash which the defendant said she intended to take, and defendant could be charged with theft of all the contents. Lawrence v. State, 269 P.3d 672 (Alaska Ct. App. 2012).

       Definition of “obtain” includes a requirement that the defendant’s exertion of control over the property was unauthorized; therefore, defendant was properly convicted of second-degree theft because his conduct of carrying items toward the exit of a retail store after going through the check-out line was inconsistent with the scope of physical possession granted to customers by the store owner. This conduct constituted the actus reus of theft. Simon v. State, 349 P.3d 191 (Alaska Ct. App. 2015).

       Father did not have a duty under this section to keep his children away from their mother’s live-in boyfriend. There was no evidence that the children had been physically or sexually abused while in the company of the boyfriend, and the trial court found that the children benefitted from the boyfriend’s presence in the household.

        The importance to the community of the enforcement of a parent’s obligation to support children within his custody supports the imposition of criminal sanctions on parents who neglect their obligations.

        In a child support case, even though a jury instruction was incomplete and potentially misleading as it related to the phrase “without lawful excuse”, no plain error was shown because the evidence did not clearly include any instances where the mother’s decision to quit working was objectively reasonable; also, other jury instructions clarified the State’s burden to show that the failure to pay was unreasonable, and the closing arguments reinforced the idea that the State had to prove that the mother acted unreasonably.

        leads to the conclusion that the offense of criminal nonsupport requires proof of a knowing failure to provide support, accompanied by a reckless disregard for ability to pay. Taylor v. State, 710 P.2d 1019 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).

        This section requires proof of knowing conduct — that is, a knowing failure to provide support — coupled with recklessness as to the need for support. S.R.D. v. State, 820 P.2d 1088 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of criminal non-support where he received a notice and finding of financial responsibility which clearly stated that he had an ongoing obligation. His receipt of these documents satisfied the requirement that his conduct be “knowing”. The prosecution was not required to show that defendant agreed that the finding of paternity against him was correct.

       <p>
        In a child support case, mother’s objection to the jury charge was insufficient to preserve an argument asserted on appeal that the charge was misleading on the element of “without lawful excuse” because she merely stated that the disputed language was not an accurate statement of Alaska law; this general objection was insufficient to put the trial judge and opposing counsel on notice of the precise nature of the issue, which was that the disputed language improperly excluded instances where a defendant might have reasonably terminated employment. Lengele v. State, 295 P.3d 931 (Alaska Ct. App. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inadvertent omission in the jury instructions on the elements of criminal nonsupport was not plain error where the element of failure to pay child support was implicit in other clauses in the instructions, the element of failure to pay was not contested at trial, and defendant's case did not present the kind of structural error found in case law. Brown v. State, 435 P.3d 989 (Alaska Ct. App. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Error identified in the instruction dealing with whether defendant had a lawful excuse for failing to pay child support was rejected as invited error where defendant's attorney had proposed the instruction, and defendant's case did not present the kind of exceptional situation necessary to overlook the invited error.

        Jury instructions, which specified only that defendant was required to have acted knowingly in failing to provide medical attention but did not specify the need to find recklessness with regard to the fact that the children actually required medical attention, amounted to plain error and required defendant’s convictions for criminal nonsupport to be vacated.

        In almost all child support contempt cases, the crucial issue will concern the defendant’s ability to comply. The burden of proof in this respect should remain with the defendant.

        He needs only to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he is unable to pay.
        Once he has met this burden, incarceration, as a coercive method, serves no useful purpose.

       After a mother left the country with her daughter to live in a cabin in the woods which had no electricity, and did not honor the week on/week off summer custody order, she was guilty of custodial interference in the first degree. Her actions did not justify a jury instruction on misdemeanor failure to permit visitation. There are critical differences between the two offenses, the most significant of which is that the father had custody during his on weeks in the summer, and not just visitation.

      A public shelter which houses runaway minors under 16 years of age without parental knowledge and consent may subject itself to prosecution for contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
      If the runaway minor requests secrecy because he or she has been physically or sexually abused and fears retribution if returned to a parent, the minor should be accorded the full protection and services of the state rather than being harbored by a runaway shelter.

      </p>
      <p>
       This section contemplates the protection of the individual child. United States v. Meyers, 139 F. Supp. 724, 16 Alaska 214 (D. Alaska 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The object of this section is to protect all children under the age of eighteen. Anderson v. State, 384 P.2d 669 (Alaska 1963), overruled, State v. Guest, 583 P.2d 836 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section was written to protect juveniles — to prevent as well as punish delinquency. Hanby v. State, 479 P.2d 486 (Alaska 1970).

        Obscenity. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutes punishing contributing to the delinquency of a minor may be drafted for the purpose of forbidding obscene materials to minors. Hanby v. State, 479 P.2d 486 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The state has the power to enact statutes to limit the access of juveniles within the state to obscenity. Such statutes may make it a crime to give, sell or display obscene materials to minors. Hanby v. State, 479 P.2d 486 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The material need not be so obscene as to be proscribed for the general population in order to be forbidden to minors. Hanby v. State, 479 P.2d 486 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        What constitutes delinquency
       </b>
       is determined largely from the language of the statute and such definitions as it may contain. United States v. Meyers, 143 F. Supp. 1, 16 Alaska 368 (D. Alaska 1956).
      </p>

       <b>
        When accused could be liable under former section. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Under former AS 11.40.130, if an accused had a reasonable belief that the person with whom he had sexual intercourse was 16 years of age or older, he could not be convicted of statutory rape. If, however, he did not have a reasonable belief that the victim was 18 years of age or older, he could still be criminally liable for contribution to the delinquency of a minor.
       State v. Guest, 583 P.2d 836 (Alaska 1978), overruling,
       Anderson v. State, 384 P.2d 669 (Alaska 1963) to the extent that its holding is inconsistent with the holding that an honest and reasonable mistake of fact as to the victim’s age may serve as a defense to a charge of statutory rape.

       <b>
        Pre-existing status as to delinquency need not be established. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no open season as to any child who has once become a delinquent.
       The state therefore is not required to establish the child’s pre-existing status as to delinquency. Anderson v. State, 384 P.2d 669 (Alaska 1963), overruled, State v. Guest, 583 P.2d 836 (Alaska 1978).

       <b>
        As child is not recognized as irreconcilably delinquent. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The court does not recognize that a child can become so irreconcilably delinquent that no act or omission can further impair its status. Anderson v. State, 384 P.2d 669 (Alaska 1963), overruled, State v. Guest, 583 P.2d 836 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Hence, act is a crime as to one already a delinquent. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the act proved would cause, tend to cause, encourage, or contribute to the delinquency of one not delinquent, then the same act is a crime when committed as to one already a delinquent. Anderson v. State, 384 P.2d 669 (Alaska 1963), overruled, State v. Guest, 583 P.2d 836 (Alaska 1978).

        Adult’s mere presence at party where minors used marijuana

       Trial court properly treated the crime of contributing to the delinquency of a minor as a lesser included offense of attempted sexual abuse of a minor in the second degree, where defendant, by encouraging an eight-year-old girl to have sexual contact with him, encouraged her to engage in conduct prohibited by law.

       The
       <i>

        Required proof. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       To be guilty of perjury, it was necessary under former law to prove that a person under oath willfully and falsely swore. Nelson v. State, 546 P.2d 592 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        One could not be convicted of perjury on the uncorroborated testimony
       </b>
       of one witness under former law. Nelson v. State, 546 P.2d 592 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>

       <b>
        Corroboration not required. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not commit plain error in its instructions to the jury on the offense of perjury which was based on grand jury testimony about alcohol because the prosecution could have been based on the uncorroborated testimony of a single witness; even if corroboration was required, this was shown through the testimony of the witnesses and the evidence that established a victim’s extreme intoxication.
       Russell-Durant v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Apr. 11, 2012) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Testimony of perjury had to be corroborated by other evidence,
       </b>
       either direct or circumstantial. Nelson v. State, 546 P.2d 592 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The purpose of such a rule
       </b>
       was to prevent ill-founded retaliatory attacks by perjury prosecution upon a witness based on no more than the contrary oath of another. Nelson v. State, 546 P.2d 592 (Alaska 1976).

        What was corroborative evidence. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to be corroborative, evidence had to induce a rational belief that what the witness said was true. Nelson v. State, 546 P.2d 592 (Alaska 1976).

       The 1980 amendment, which replaced the words “on a charge of” with the word “for” in (a)(1)(B), clarifies rather than changes the meaning of this section. Maynard v. State, 652 P.2d 489 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the officers arresting defendant had probable cause to believe he had committed a felony, at the time he escaped, defendant was officially detained “on a charge of a felony.” Maynard v. State, 652 P.2d 489 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982) (decided under the language of (a)(1)(B) prior to the 1980 amendment).

       when he ran away while being transferred to a private institution where he was to complete residential alcohol treatment as a condition of probation. The defendant was on probation, so the appropriate remedy for his departure was revocation of his probation and imposition of the suspended portion of his sentence, not a separate charge of escape. Beckman v. State, 689 P.2d 500 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Official detention,” as used in this section, does not apply to investigative stops. Jacobson v. State, 786 P.2d 388 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a district court judge set bail for a defendant in a theft prosecution and then asked him, “Do you want to come forward and take a seat in the jury box?”, the defendant, who did not take a seat in the jury box but instead left the courtroom, was never under “official detention for a felony” within the meaning of this section.

       Trial counsel properly acquiesced to a jury instruction on the common law elements of “arrest” where the State’s theory of the case was that the defendant was arrested, i.e., placed in “official detention” under subparagraph (a)(1)(B) of this section and

       There was no error in the trial court’s instruction to the jury defining “remove” as, “to change in location, to move,” when read with the other instructions which required the jury to find that defendant removed himself from official detention which in context meant the immediate presence of the arresting officers.

       Defendant was properly convicted of second-degree escape from a privately owned halfway house that was operated under contract with the Department of Corrections because, while the facility's handbook erroneously cited the wrong statute when it stated that a felony defendant who absconded from the facility could be charged with "unlawful evasion," it did not say that "unlawful evasion" was a misdemeanor or that "unlawful evasion" was a less serious crime than "escape," defendant's counsel never asserted that defendant relied to his detriment on the handbook when he decided to abscond, the trial judge had no duty to raise a due process argument on defendant's behalf sua sponte.

       Superior court properly convicted defendant of second-degree escape because defendant's "mistake of law" claim was not based on the direct statement of a police official, but rather based on a combination of a misstatement in a halfway house residents' handbook written by a contractor working for the Department of Corrections and defendant's own personal understanding of the law and, even assuming that the doctrine of equitable estoppel applied, the public interest would be significantly prejudiced.

       Regarding defendant's convictions for fourth-degree escape and fourth-degree theft, the appellate court concluded that fair-minded jurors could find that the State had proved the elements of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the appellate court rejected defendant's arguments that the evidence was legally insufficient to support these convictions.

       Defendant was properly convicted of second-degree escape from a privately owned halfway house that was operated under contract with the Department of Corrections because, while the facility's handbook erroneously cited the wrong statute when it stated that a felony defendant who absconded from the facility could be charged with "unlawful evasion," it did not say that "unlawful evasion" was a misdemeanor or that "unlawful evasion" was a less serious crime than "escape," defendant's counsel never asserted that defendant relied to his detriment on the handbook when he decided to abscond, the trial judge had no duty to raise a due process argument on defendant's behalf sua sponte.

       Indictment charging parents with interference with official proceedings was properly dismissed, where the parents’ use of force in arranging for children to fly to Arizona in order to prevent them from testifying in a child abuse case was limited to that typical of any parental or custodial relationship. State v. Jones, 750 P.2d 828 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).

       Where defendant pointed his finger angrily at his child and yelled “Remember the rule” in a menacing tone as police were removing the child from the household after a report of abuse, a reasonable juror could readily have concluded that defendant’s words were spoken as a threat intended to deter the child from cooperating with the authorities.

       Where the state proved defendant committed a deliberate and apparently unprovoked assault on the victim not long after the victim testified against the defendant in a criminal trial in which the defendant had been convicted and ordered to pay the victim restitution, the state presented circumstantial evidence from which the jury could properly infer that the defendant acted with retaliatory purposes.

       Where defendant was charged with interference with official proceedings, the state did not need to prove that defendant acted with the intent to retaliate against victim for having “snitched” on codefendant because of victim’s participation in an official proceeding.
       Rather, in order for defendant to be found liable as an accomplice, the state needed only to prove that defendant intentionally aided codefendant, knowing of codefendant’s criminal purpose. It was not necessary that he have known of the criminality of the conduct. Mudge v. State, 760 P.2d 1046 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).

       In enacting the tampering with a witness statute, the legislature elected to extend its provisions only to witnesses who are formally summoned to appear. State v. Jones, 750 P.2d 828 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).

       Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for tampering with a witness by attempting to dissuade his wife from giving damaging testimony to the grand jury, where a witness testified that he was at defendant’s house before the grand jury proceeding and heard defendant tell his wife to “plead the fifth” or “break down and cry” instead of answering questions detrimental to defendant’s case. Boggess v. State, 783 P.2d 1173 (Alaska Ct. App. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was sufficient to support dedfendant’s conviction for first-degree witness tampering where he attempted to induce the witness to offer false or misleading testimony at an official proceeding by trying to persuade the potential witness to say that someone other than defendant had been driving the car.

       Defendant did not violate the witness tampering statute when he advised his partner that she did not have to testify before the grand jury if she had not been subpoenaed, or when he urged her not to testify voluntarily; defendant asked the victim to tell the authorities that she wanted to drop the burglary charge, and this was not a request or suggestion that she lie about what happened or that she unlawfully withhold testimony; further, a person did not commit witness tampering if they advised the witness to give “yes” or “no” answers whenever reasonably possible, and not to volunteer information if the extra information was not solicited by the examiner’s questions. Rantala v. State, 216 P.3d 550 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence did not support defendant's witness tampering conviction because asking a witness not to tell the police defendant fired at assailants did not violate the statute.

      <p>
       Evidence was insufficient to convict defendant of witness tampering because it was unreasonable to interpret defendant's words in a letter he wrote to his girlfriend as a threat to the victim that he would “suffer the consequences” if he testified against defendant in an official proceeding; the reasonable interpretation was that defendant was telling his girlfriend that he would receive a serious sentence if the victim decided to testify against him.

       Where defendant violated a court order by telephoning his wife from jail to persuade her not to testify against him, defendant could be charged with tampering with a witness in violation of this section. The superior court erred by granting defendant’s motion to suppress the telephone records; the Supreme Court of Alaska held that defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his phone calls from jail.

       Audio recordings of defendant’s conversations with his wife were admissible in his trial for witness tampering because the recordings were relevant, as it was established that defendant asked his wife not to testify against him after she had been subpoenaed.

The trial court did not err by allowing the State to introduce photographs of the trash bags into evidence because the photographs were based on an officer’s observations, and defendant established no reason for their exclusion.

       Evidence was sufficient to establish mother’s guilt of tampering with a witness in the first degree where she attempted to induce her daughter to be absent from father’s trial for sexually abusing daughter by fleeing the jurisdiction with her after both had been subpoenaed to appear as witnesses, and concealing their whereabouts thereafter. Russell v. State, 793 P.2d 1085 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s conviction for tampering with physical evidence was appropriate because she admitted that she used illegal drugs and that she attempted to use an old drug-free urine sample in her drug test. If her urine sample had disclosed that she had consumed methadone defendant would have been in violation of her probation, facing revocation of that probation.

       In a case in which defendant's son shot and killed two state troopers, and defendant was prosecuted for altering evidence in an effort to make it look as if his son had acted in defense of defendant, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of evidence tampering for tampering with each of the two troopers' service handguns because defendant removed a cartridge from each of the troopers' service pistols, and he removed the pistols from their holsters and then re-positioned the two weapons; and those actions altered the evidentiary significance of the handguns as the guns were re-positioned in ways that falsely appeared to corroborate defendant's story that the troopers drew their weapons. Kangas v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. June 13, 2018) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was properly convicted of evidence tampering because despite a police officer's instruction to not touch a small plastic bag that was between his feet, when he got out of the van, the bag was missing and not found until he turned his pockets inside-out at the officer's request, at which point, defendant put the bag in his mouth and swallowed it.

      <p>
       In a case in which defendant's third conviction for evidence tampering was based on evidence that he solicited or directed his son to remove all the marijuana plants and seeds from the house, and to throw those materials over the riverbank, the evidence was sufficient to sustain that conviction because, although there was no evidence that defendant personally removed the marijuana from the residence, the evidence showed that defendant solicited or directed his son to remove the marijuana and dispose of it; thus, defendant could be found criminally responsible for his son's action.
       Kangas v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. June 13, 2018) (memorandum decision).

       Evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction for attempted evidence tampering where defendant’s actions of going behind a dumpster out of the officer’s direct view and allegedly discarding something did not make it impossible or substantially more difficult for the officer to recover a slip of cocaine from behind the dumpster. Stepovich v. State, 299 P.3d 734 (Alaska Ct. App. 2013), cert. denied, 571 U.S. 1203, 134 S. Ct. 1335, 188 L. Ed. 2d 309 (U.S. 2014).

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial judge sentenced defendant to a composite term of 85 years to serve, including 85 years for the murder conviction, and a concurrent two years for evidence tampering; no clear mistake was shown, as the trial court found that the murder was an execution, but defendant was young and had no felony record.

      <p>
       In a case in which defendant's son shot and killed two state troopers, and defendant was prosecuted for altering evidence in an effort to make it look as if his son had acted in defense of defendant, defendant's sentence of 8 years to serve was not clearly mistaken for his two evidence tampering convictions involving manipulating and re-positioning the state troopers' service pistols because the trial judge concluded that defendant had an ingrained pattern of assaultive and disorderly behavior, as well as belligerence toward the police; that defendant's potential for rehabilitation was nearly nil; and that a long period of incarceration was needed to keep the public, and public safety officers, safe from harm.

        Applicability. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not apply to situations where a defendant merely tries to hide or to evade an officer. Howard v. State, 101 P.3d 1054 (Alaska Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Resistance prohibited. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section precludes resistance to a law enforcement officer’s attempts to take an arrestee into custody where private person who initiates arrest has delegated this task to the peace officer. Moxie v. State, 662 P.2d 990 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's briefing of his argument that his act of trying to seize a police officer's firearm did not constitute the crime of resisting arrest was insufficient to preserve the issue for appeal because defendant cited a single case from another state; there was a substantial split in authority as to when an arrest could be considered "over" or "completed" for purposes of a resisting arrest statute, and it was a complicated issue with no ready answer.
       Lopez v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 8, 2018) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Joinder of charges. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Charges of sexual assault in the first degree, resisting arrest, fourth-degree assault, and providing false information to a peace officer were sufficiently connected to justify joinder under Alaska R. Crim. P. 8(a)(3) because the evidence of the sexual assault was relevant to show that defendant had a motive for giving false information, resisting arrest, and assaulting an officer when the officers approached defendant 18 days later. And the evidence that defendant gave a false name and attempted to avoid arrest was correspondingly relevant to show guilty knowledge of the sexual assault. Shorty v. State, 214 P.3d 374 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        What the state must prove. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to convict defendant of resisting arrest, the state had to prove that the police were arresting defendant, that defendant knew the officers were arresting him, and that defendant used force with the intent to prevent the officers from making the arrest. Jones v. State, 11 P.3d 998 (Alaska Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no basis for a jury to find that defendant’s act of hiding in the woods constituted a threat of imminent bodily impact; therefore, the state did not present sufficient evidence to convict defendant of resisting arrest. Howard v. State, 101 P.3d 1054 (Alaska Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Verdict of resisting arrest under subsection (a)(3) was error where evidence showed that defendant simply jerked away from a police officer, oriented his body so that his arms and wrists were underneath his torso, and announced “No, I ain’t going”; such conduct did not rise above mere nonsubmission and did not actively create a danger of physical injury. Eide v. State, 168 P.3d 499 (Alaska Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s conviction for resisting arrest was not supported by the evidence. Although defendant tucked his arms under his body to avoid being cuffed, there was no evidence that he bucked or otherwise tried to dislodge the arresting officer from his back or tried to grab the officer in any way.
       Nelson v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Feb. 1, 2012) (memorandum decision).

      <p>
       <b>
        Substantial evidence
       </b>
       supported defendant’s conviction for resisting arrest, where the evidence supported the jury’s conclusion that defendant knew police officers were arresting him and intended to resist arrest when he struggled with the officers. Sergie v. State, 105 P.3d 1150 (Alaska Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was sufficient evidence that defendant knew he was under arrest for purposes of a charge under AS
       <cite class="ocak">
        <a href="#t11c56a05s11.56.700ol1a1" target="_self">

       because defendant gave an officer a false name and false birthdays, appeared to make preparations to flee or fight, and began to resist the officers quite violently when they tried to handcuff his second hand. Shorty v. State, 214 P.3d 374 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the officer took defendant to the back of the patrol car to arrest him, defendant pushed himself away from the car so that the officer had to take him to the ground; defendant tried to get up and continued to tense his arms against his back, and took the help of a passing motorist to get defendant handcuffed and in the patrol car, defendant’s conduct went beyond “mere non-submission to an arrest,” and the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction for resisting arrest by force. Fallon v. State, 221 P.3d 1016 (Alaska Ct. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence showed that defendant was belligerent, repeatedly threatened to kill the officer, and maneuvered his handcuffed hands to the front of his body, possibly to facilitate an attack on the officer; these facts were sufficient to establish the offense of resisting arrest, and the jury could have concluded that defendant did not just try to obstruct his arrest by non-submission, but instead went beyond this when he used force directly against the officer by threatening him.
       Alexie v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Apr. 3, 2013) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s conviction for resisting arrest because a fair-minded juror could reasonably find that defendant used force directed at the state troopers with the intention of preventing his arrest. Among other things, defendant moved his shoulders to keep the troopers from handcuffing him, continued to struggle, and kept trying to get up after he was put on the floor with a leg sweep. Velarde v. State, 353 P.3d 355 (Alaska Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was legally sufficient to support defendant's resisting arrest conviction where a jury could have concluded that he knew that troopers were trying to take him into custody when they wrestled him to the ground, and that he continued to fight to prevent them from doing so.
       Grim v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Feb. 3, 2016) (memorandum decision).
      </p>

        Evidence insufficient. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was insufficient to support defendant’s conviction for resisting arrest because, although defendant had been warned that he would be handcuffed if he did not remain calm, there was little reason to believe knew it was an actual “arrest” until told; defendant’s actions were a type of “passive positioning.”
       Hoover v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. July 17, 2013) (memorandum decision).

      </p>
      <p>
       State trooper testified that, while he did not actually get a grip on defendant’s arm when he reached to place him in handcuffs, he did get a hold of a little piece of defendant’s jacket or cuff while defendant was running away; such minimal contact was not sufficient to constitute “force” under this section. Howard v. State, 101 P.3d 1054 (Alaska Ct. App. 2004).

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant sought to present evidence from an emergency room doctor regarding injuries he sustained during an arrest. The complete nature and extent of the injuries were before the jury, and there was no persuasive evidence that the arresting officer filed resisting arrest charges as a way of justifying the injuries to defendant. A doctor’s testimony would not have added any further evidence.

      <p>
       When defendant was convicted of burglary and violating a domestic violence protective order for entering his wife's home in violation of the order, the statute's legislative history did not show the legislature did not intend the burglary statute to apply because that history did not make the burglary statute ambiguous or make the burglary statute's application patently absurd or unreasonable.

        Culpable mental state. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A violation of this section is not a strict liability offense since, although a person may be convicted of violating a protective order without being aware of the existence of the criminal sanction, this does not mean that a person could be convicted when they had no reason to believe that they might be subject to a protective order, because it is the court’s issuance of such an order that is the circumstance or event that triggers the regulation or restriction of the defendant’s conduct. Strane v. State, 981 P.2d 122 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since no portion of this section expressly designates the crime as one of strict liability, and the wording of the statute gives no other indication that the legislature wished to dispense with proof of a culpable mental state, the rule of statutory construction obliged the appellate court to construe the statute as requiring proof of culpable mental state. Strane v. State, 981 P.2d 122 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the violation of a domestic protective order appears to be merely a specific variety of indirect contempt, the mens rea element that traditionally is required for all contempts is also required for this offense. Strane v. State, 981 P.2d 122 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       A person can be punished for violating a domestic violence protective order when the government proves that the person recklessly disregarded the possibility that their conduct was restricted or prohibited by the provisions of that order, or when the government proves that the person knowingly chose to remain ignorant of the provisions of the order. Strane v. State, 981 P.2d 122 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the wording of the statute and its legislative history are irresolvably ambiguous on the culpable mental state the legislature intended, the law requires a decision in favor of individual liberty and against the government; therefore, if a person is subject to a protective order containing a provision listed in

       Evidence of nineteen prior violations had a case-specific relevance and was not barred because the fact that defendant had repeatedly violated court orders protecting a family was relevant to show the depth of her antipathy toward a specific group of people; defendant's antipathy was relevant because her defense was that the family had misinterpreted innocent actions on her part.

      <p>
       The district court erred in ruling that even if the defendant had a good-faith belief that his conduct did not violate the terms of the protective order, this belief was irrelevant to his guilt or innocence under subsection (a), because subsection (a) requires proof that a defendant acted “knowingly” with regard to the circumstance that their conduct violated the protective order. Therefore, defendant could potentially defend on the basis of a good-faith mistake concerning the terms of the protective order, even if that mistake was objectively unreasonable. Strane v.

      <p>
       Ex-husband’s appeal of a long-term protective order was not moot, despite the expiration of certain terms of the order, because the order’s provision prohibiting him from threatening to commit or committing domestic violence remained in effect indefinitely; the order was permanently filed in a central registry of protective orders and, if the ex-husband violated the order, he would be in violation of this section, and subject to mandatory arrest.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court based its verdict that defendant violated a domestic violence protective order not only on defendant’s no contest plea to assault, in which he agreed the trial court could find that he engaged in knowing conduct toward the victim, but also on the testimony at trial, which was sufficient to support the conclusion that defendant knowingly committed an assault on the victim. Thompson v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Sept. 24, 2014) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court properly denied defendant's motion for a new trial for violating a protective order because the evidence at trial was sufficient for a fair-minded juror to conclude that defendant understood that the “Marie Peter Residence” in the order referred to the couple's shared residence, and not defendant's partner's mother's house, by continuing to occupy that residence (particularly after the partner moved back into the residence), defendant acted in reckless disregard of the fact that his conduct violated the protective order, and the court properly remedied the insufficient evidence to support two separate convictions by merging them into a single conviction.

       Challenged jury instruction, that defendant could be found guilty of violating protective orders if the State proved either of two things beyond a reasonable doubt and that the jurors did not have to unanimously agree on which of the two things had been proved, did not present an instance of plain error because Alaska law did not provide a ready answer to the question of whether defendant's conduct would support two separate convictions.

       District court properly refused to instruct the jury on the defense of necessity because, while the protective order at issue prohibited defendant from contacting the victim directly, his mother was listed as a third-party intermediary in the order, defendant reasonably should have known that asking his mother to contact the victim to obtain his medication was an adequate alternative to going to the residence himself.

      <p>
       When defendant was convicted of burglary and violating a domestic violence protective order for entering his wife's home in violation of the order, separate convictions were proper because (1) when a defendant entered a building with intent to commit a crime, and then proceeded to commit the intended crime, it was proper for the defendant to receive separate convictions for the burglary and for the ulterior crime, and (2) the unlawfulness of the entry stemmed from the order's 500-foot limit, while defendant intended to commit the crime of violating the order's no-contact provision.

       The defendant was properly charged under this section for violating a domestic violence restraining order since, even though the order was not supported by the evidence presented and was ultimately vacated, the defendant was not free to violate the restraining order while it remained in effect. Jacko v. State, 981 P.2d 1075 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was proper not to permit the defendant to present evidence that the victim had on prior occasions falsely accused him of violating a protective order because defendant did not explain how the evidence was relevant to the determination of whether he was reckless when he made the telephone call at issue.

        Jailhouse phone call evidence held admissible to prove violation. —

       Where defendant violated a court order by telephoning his wife from jail to persuade her not to testify against him, defendant was properly charged with unlawful contact in the first degree in violation of this section. The superior court erred by granting defendant’s motion to suppress the telephone records; the Supreme Court of Alaska held that defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his phone calls from jail.
       State v. Avery, 211 P.3d 1154 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       When defendant was convicted of first-degree unlawful contact for telephoning a victim from jail, defendant's claim that Alaska courts had no power to bar a defendant in pretrial detention from contacting an alleged victim failed because (1) no statute granted or denied Alaska courts such authority, so Alaska courts had the inherent authority to issue such orders to protect victims and witnesses, and (2) the order did not infringe on the discretion of the Department of Corrections to decide where to house an inmate.

       Reversal of defendant's conviction for second-degree unlawful contact was appropriate because, before the State of Alaska could lawfully impose a criminal penalty on defendant for telephoning defendant's spouse following defendant's arrest for domestic assault, the State was required (at a minimum) to prove that defendant was told that it was unlawful for defendant to contact the victim.

       Defendant was erroneously convicted of violating the conditions of his bail release because, while the attorneys and the judge discussed the elements of the crime in his presence, as well as his right to a jury trial on that charge, the record did not demonstrate whether he understood everything that they were talking about and whether he was willing to waive his right to jury trial and agree to have the judge decide his guilt or innocence.

       As pending legislation was relevant to defendant's sentence for violating the conditions of his bail release, and the issue was directly raised, the trial court was required to address this in its sentencing analysis; the trial court was directed to reconsider defendant's sentence in light of the current classification of his offense as a class B misdemeanor, with a maximum penalty of five days' imprisonment.

       Defendant violated the conditions of his bail release; the district court took appropriate steps to address defendant's concerns by conducting an on-the-record inquiry regarding the nature and extent of the prior association between the prosecutor and the defense attorney's daughter where both attorneys confirmed the limited nature of the prior association and its irrelevance to defendant's case. Any error in appointing the Office of Public Advocacy in an investigative capacity was harmless, and the jury would not have been misled by any latent ambiguity in the jury instruction regarding the culpable mental state.

       Special probation requirement. —

     </p>
     <p>
      Superior court properly imposed defendants' remaining jail time and refused to honor their rejection of further probation because, even though the original statute was repealed, its special probation requirement remained in force for the purpose of sustaining any prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty or liability, defendants could not reject the special term of probation, and had to serve out their statutorily mandated periods of probation, even though they had no further term of imprisonment remaining from their original sentences where another statute made it a separate crime for sex offenders to violate the conditions of their probation in such a situation. 2018 Alas.

       In enacting the hindering prosecution statutes, the legislature unequivocally expressed the intent to dispense with any requirement of awareness as to the legal classification of the crime committed by the assisted person. Noblit v. State, 808 P.2d 280 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).

       Alaska's definition of renders assistance was intended to codify the Model Penal Code's approach of narrowing the scope of prosecution from what it had been at common law.

       refers to different types of physical or material aid, the principle of ejusdem generis counsels the Court of Appeals of Alaska to interpret the concluding phrase “other means of avoiding discovery or apprehension” as likewise referring to physical or material aid, and not the act of lying to the authorities.

      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska's hindering prosecution statute appears to be drawn from the Model Penal Code (by way of the Hawai'i statutes). The Model Penal Code version of this offense was expressly drafted to ensure that the act of lying to the police during a police-initiated interview would not constitute the offense of hindering prosecution.

       Where it is found that the defendant rendered assistance to another with knowledge of the other person’s wrongdoing and with the specific intent to hinder his prosecution, this culpable mental state affords adequate protection against the possibility of a conviction based on innocent conduct; no additional culpable mental state is necessary for due process purposes.

       When a person renders assistance to a felony probationer by harboring or concealing the probationer, knowing that the police are trying to arrest the probationer for violating the terms of probation, the person acts with the intent to “hinder the punishment” of “a person who has committed a felony” within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

      </p>
      <p>
       Prosecutor's mention of defendant's refusal to consent to a search was harmless because, as to evidence destruction, (1) the jury learned this was incorrect, (2) evidence defendant purposely erased a cell phone call log was strong, (3) such testimony supported harboring by lodging, of which defendant was acquitted, and (4) prejudice was attenuated, so another verdict without the comment or testimony was not reasonably possible.

       While statutes which address the concealing of evidence are generally construed to require an affirmative act of concealment in addition to the failure to disclose information to the authorities, a defense attorney’s taking possession of evidence from a nonclient third party and holding the evidence in a place not accessible to investigating authorities would seem to fall within predecessor section’s ambit.

      <p>
       Plain language of subsection (a) suggests that there is a distinction between giving “false information” and making “a false report”; it is crime to make a false report of a crime because of the likelihood that the police will take some action in response to the sort of information that would be included in such a “report.” Coleman v. State, 407 P.3d 502 (Alaska Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because two subsections of the statute make it a crime to give “false information,” while the other three subsections of the statute declare that it is crime to make a “false report” or to give a “false alarm,” the courts are to presume that the legislature meant something different by these phrases; that is, the courts should presume that giving “false information” does not mean exactly the same thing as making a “false report.” Coleman v. State, 407 P.3d 502 (Alaska Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Crime of making a false report of a crime requires the State to prove that the person knowingly made a false statement to the police that a crime had occurred or was about to occur under circumstances that objectively created a reasonable likelihood that the police would act on the false claim and expend law enforcement resources doing so.
       Coleman v. State, 407 P.3d 502 (Alaska Ct. App. 2017).

       When defendant gave the state trooper false information regarding his identity, he violated the false information or report statute; however, by signing a traffic ticket under a false name, defendant committed the additional offense of forgery. Howard v. State, 101 P.3d 1054 (Alaska Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Search of defendant’s vehicle, and the ensuing discovery and seizure of cocaine and a handgun, were lawful where state troopers had sufficient reason to believe that defendant’s vehicle contained evidence of the crime of false identification; it was reasonable to suppose that defendant’s driver’s license might be found in her coat in the back seat. Deemer v. State, 244 P.3d 69 (Alaska Ct. App. 2010).

      <p>
       Circumstances when the person has formally filed the false report, or when the person is responsible for initiating the contact with the police and summoning them to the scene, are relevant considerations when determining whether a false statement about a crime constitutes a “false report” under the statute; but those circumstances do not represent the only ways that a person can commit the crime of making a false report under Alaska law. Coleman v. State, 407 P.3d 502 (Alaska Ct. App. 2017).

       Defendant’s statements concerning his oral accusation that a police officer had taken $250 from the glove compartment of his truck, which the police officer authorized to be towed for operating without lights or current registration, were prohibited by former AS 11.30.215, which made it a misdemeanor to give a false report of a crime to a peace officer.

       Evidence at trial was insufficient to establish that defendant’s false statement to the police about his van being stolen qualified as a “false report” because defendant did not include any details or provide the type of information that the police would need to investigate such a claim, and he made clear that he was not seeking any police assistance with regard to the stolen van or expecting the police to investigate the alleged crime.

       State trooper did not have probable cause to arrest defendant for false information when officer stopped the car in which defendant was a passenger, and the officer could not locate the name defendant gave, along with the given birth date, under the Alaska Public Safety Information Network, and the officer then conducted a pat-down search, and found an identification card with a different first name than that which defendant had given.

       Charges of sexual assault in the first degree, resisting arrest, fourth-degree assault, and providing false information to a peace officer were sufficiently connected to justify joinder under Alaska R. Crim. P. 8(a)(3) because the evidence of the sexual assault was relevant to show that defendant had a motive for giving false information, resisting arrest, and assaulting an officer when the officers approached defendant 18 days later. The evidence that defendant gave a false name and attempted to avoid arrest was correspondingly relevant to show guilty knowledge of the sexual assault. Shorty v. State, 214 P.3d 374 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).

       Defendant was prejudiced when the State was permitted, after the close of evidence, to amend the information on a false information charge, which criminalized providing false information with the intent of implicating another in an offense, which criminalized the act of providing false information while under arrest, detention, or investigation for a crime. Because the amendment was improper under Alaska Criminal Rule 7(e), the conviction was reversed. Shorty v. State, 214 P.3d 374 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).

       The obvious purpose in requiring that a threat be “repeated” before becoming a terroristic threat is to assure that the harsh sanction of felony prosecution will not be visited upon a person for making a rash statement out of transitory anger or in the heat of passion.

       There was ample evidence to permit a finding that defendant made “repeated threats” to take his wife’s life, where the threats were not made in a continuous manner but were repeated over a period of more than fifteen minutes. Konrad v. State, 763 P.2d 1369 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).

       Defendant's argument regarding the ambiguous meaning of “previously purchased” was moot as to his convictions for knowingly guiding a client on a hunt without a valid nonresident tag and/or harvest ticket, failing to report the illegal hunt, and tampering with a public record for falsifying the client's hunt and tag records because the jury was faced with a choice between the client's testimony that he did not fill out the paperwork or pay for the tag, and defendant's testimony that he did.

       District court erred in allowing both sides to offer their own definitions of the term “previously purchased” because it had a duty to resolve the question of statutory interpretation and instruct the jury on the definition; defendant was entitled to reversal of his convictions for knowingly aiding a client in taking a brown bear without a valid nonresident big game tag and tampering with a public record for falsifying the client's big game hunt and tag records to indicate he had a valid tag.

       Not redacting “sex offender” from a failure to register charge was not plain error because the crime's definition was relevant information for a jury and needed for jurors to understand defendant's duty to register so jurors could evaluate if the State proved intent.

       For discussion of whether the sanction of the Registration Act,
       ch. 41, SLA 1994, entails an affirmative disability or restraint, whether the sanction has historically been regarded as punitive, whether the sanction depends upon a finding of scienter, whether the sanction will operate to promote traditional punishment objectives, whether the sanction applies to behavior which is already a crime, whether there is an alternative non-punitive purpose for the sanction, and whether the sanction is excessive in relation to the alternative purpose, see
       Rowe v. Burton, 884 F. Supp. 1372 (D. Alaska 1994), rev'd, 248 F.3d 832 (9th Cir. Alaska 2001), reversed on other grounds, sub nom.

      <p>
       The Registration Act,
       ch. 41, SLA 1994, is likely to violate the prohibition on ex post facto legislation, because the law includes a provision providing for public dissemination of information concerning sex offenders whose convictions antedate the Registration Act.

      <p>
       Because the Registration Act,
       ch. 41, SLA 1994, is likely penal in nature because of the provision for public dissemination of information, plaintiffs, who pled no contest to sex offenses pursuant to plea bargains that did not include any duty to register, are likely to prevail on claims for violation of the plea agreements and due process.

       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of second-degree failure to register as a sex offender because the trial judge found that defendant knew that he was no longer living at the drug- and alcohol-free rooming house, knew that he would have to verify his address information at the time of his quarterly deadline, and knew that he had to give notice the next day if he changed residences; and, while defendant might have legitimately been confused or unsure about what new address or location to submit, as he was homeless, the record supported the district court's conclusion that defendant was aware that he had to do something to be in compliance with the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act.

       Defendant, who was required to register as a sex offender under the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act, was properly convicted of not complying with the statute where defendant prepared the required quarterly verification reports but did not swear or attest to the accuracy of the reports citing concerns about perjury. Dailey v. State, 65 P.3d 891 (Alaska Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defense stipulation that defendant was a convicted sex offender in a case relating to failure to register as a sex offender was properly accepted by the court. Defendant then argued on appeal that he had not formally waived a jury determination of that element of the offense of failure to register when he made the stipulation, and that failure to waive his right to a jury determination was error. On appeal the court determined that there was no merit to the defendant’s argument.

        Protection of societal interests.
       </b>
       — District court erred in ruling that the sexual assault and official misconduct statutes protected distinct societal interests that would support separate convictions because, given defendant's no-contest plea and the way the case was charged, the two charges against defendant protected the same societal interest — the legislature's policy of not allowing police officers to engage in any sexual activity with a person who was in their custody, even if that sexual activity was not coerced by force or threat of force, and even if the person in custody was otherwise capable of consenting to the sexual activity — and defendant's two offenses would support only one criminal conviction.

        Noise prohibition not unconstitutionally vague. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph (a)(1) and subsection (b) give reasonable notice of the conduct which they prohibit, and the phrase “unreasonably loud noise” is not unconstitutionally vague.
       The statute provides that “noise” does not include speech that is constitutionally protected and is therefore not overbroad. Earley v. State, 789 P.2d 374 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).

      <p>
       <b>
        Declaration that “noise” does not “include speech that is constitutionally protected”
       </b>
       was not intended to create a wholesale exemption for political and commercial speech irrespective of time, place and decibel level; rather, it embodies the legislative intention that the statute not be used to prosecute activity that is protected from prosecution by the first amendment. Turney v. State, 922 P.2d 283 (Alaska Ct. App. 1996), superseded, 936 P.2d 533 (Alaska 1997).

        “Fight” defined. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The word “fight”, in paragraph (a)(5), means to struggle against a person in physical combat. Walsh v. State, 758 P.2d 124 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       For purposes of paragraph (a)(5), “fighting” requires a mutuality of intention; accordingly, (a)(5) does not cover all situations where one person strikes another. Dawson v. State, 264 P.3d 851 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011).
      </p>

       <b>
        “Engages in fighting other than in self-defense” defined. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       No instruction on the lesser-included offense of disorderly conduct was required during defendant’s assault trial because the phrase “engages in fighting other than in self-defense” as used in paragraph (a)(5) does not include one-sided attacks, but rather is limited to altercations where the parties share a mutual intent or willingness to fight. The victim’s becoming angry with defendant, criticizing defendant, and pulling the ignition fuse from defendant’s vehicle did not constitute “fighting.” Dawson v. State, 264 P.3d 851 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011).

        Mutual combat not shown. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred by determining that the April 2015 incident was not an act of domestic violence because the ex-wife's unsuccessful effort to keep the ex-husband from taking her phone did not qualify as the type of mutual combat that could transform the ex-husband's actions from an attempted theft and subsequent assault into disorderly conduct.

      </p>
      <p>
       Insofar as the theory of disorderly conduct rests on the tendency of the actor’s behavior to provoke violence in others, one must suppose that policemen, employed and trained to maintain order, would be least likely to be provoked to disorderly responses.

      </p>
      <p>
       That an officer was personally offended by defendant’s telephone call did not render the defendant’s conduct a crime. Anniskette v. State, 489 P.2d 1012 (Alaska 1971).

       Summary judgment for a state trooper was reversed in an arrestee’s 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 action where the arrestee’s version of events and the affidavit of his friend raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the facts and circumstances known to the trooper would support a reasonable belief that the arrestee’s words were unreasonably loud or created a hazardous condition in violation of this section: The arrestee alleged that the trooper arrested him because the arrestee continued to speak after the trooper repeatedly warned him not to, and his friend stated in an affidavit that both the arrestee and the trooper spoke to each other at about the same level of voice volume, a very formal and normal tone of voice; he also stated that during the incident no one in the office asked anyone to lower their voices.

        Evidence insufficient to show creation of hazardous condition for others. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where (1) defendant’s response to arresting trooper’s questioning could be viewed as constitutionally protected verbal opposition to what he perceived as overreaching by an officer, (2) the trooper’s affidavit indicated that he made the arrest in part because he was annoyed by the arrestee’s behavior, (3) the arrestee’s friend stated that neither the arrestee nor the trooper were speaking loudly, and (4) given the trooper’s physically dominant position over the arrestee, who was seated while the trooper was standing over him, it was not clear as a matter of law that a reasonable officer could find that the arrestee was creating a hazardous condition for others. Crawford v. Kemp, 139 P.3d 1249 (Alaska 2006).

        Evidence insufficient to convict. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial judge erred in refusing to grant defendant’s motion to suppress where defendant was not making unreasonably loud noise; the defendant had the right, under this section, to be informed that he was making unreasonably loud noise, and to be given an opportunity to desist. The noise made by defendant was not unreasonably loud, and, in any event, he was not warned. Tuttle v. State, 175 P.3d 60 (Alaska Ct. App. 2008).

       <b>
        Factual unanimity instruction.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in convicting defendant of disorderly conduct because the trial judge's error in failing to give a factual unanimity instruction was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt inasmuch as the evidence adduced at trial identified three discrete instances of potentially unreasonable noise — a firecracker, loud music, and defendant's yell from the porch, and the prosecutor never informed either defendant's attorney or the trial judge that he was proceeding only on the yell, even though defendant's attorney specifically drew the court's attention to the factual unanimity problem and requested a factual unanimity instruction.

       Although the State charged defendant with two separate counts of harassment based upon the fact that the incident occurred in two separate rooms of a gift shop, the State properly conceded that defendant engaged in one continuous course of conduct and that the convictions should have been merged because the rooms were close to one another, the transit between them took but seconds, and the fact that they were not physically joined was a fortuity.

       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of two counts of first-degree harassment for touching the clothed buttocks of a woman working in a gift shop because the State introduced a substantial amount of evidence to prove that defendant was the one who harassed the store clerk and, from the outset of the case, defendant's lawyer conceded the issue of identity by stating that defendant was the person in the gift shop; and the State established that defendant engaged in offensive touching with the intent to harass or annoy the clerk as she testified that, at one point, she could feel a pressure in the back by her buttocks and then she could feel defendant pumping up and down on his penis.

       This section does not punish speech simply because it is anonymous. While the anonymity of the caller is itself a circumstance raising discomfort and fear in the receiver of the call, nevertheless the statute requires proof of an additional element: that the caller’s purpose was to annoy or harass the other person.

       In dismissing a second- degree harassment charge, the trial court erred in ruling that defendant’s social media post stating that a politician would be assassinated was protected speech under the First Amendment. The government did not have to prove that defendant truly intended to carry through with an act of physical violence against the politician. State v. Borowski, 378 P.3d 409 (Alaska Ct. App. 2016).

       (intentionality), the statute is theoretically broad enough to punish political speech or other legitimate communication upon proof that one of the speaker’s subsidiary motives was to annoy the listener. Because the scope of the statute is potentially so broad, paragraph (a)(4) of this section must be interpreted to prohibit telephone calls only when the call has no legitimate communicative purpose, when the caller’s speech is devoid of any substantive information, and the caller’s sole intention is to annoy or harass the recipient.

       Defendant was properly denied postconviction relief on his claim that his appellate counsel was incompetent for failing to raise the argument that there was no act a person might perform that would be likely to provoke an immediate violent response from a police officer and therefore he could not be convicted under this section because the claim was no more than debatable.

       It was no error to deny defendant’s request for a lesser-included-offense instruction on second- degree harassment because a jury could convict defendant of third-degree assault without convicting defendant of second-degree harassment, as a jury could find defendant’s reckless disregard of the risk that defendant’s acts put another in fear of imminent serious physical injury without finding an intent to harass or annoy.

       Trial court erred in failing to merge defendant’s convictions for possession of child pornography and distribution of child pornography because the distribution charge was premised upon defendant’s possession of hundreds of images of child pornography. Because the charges were based on the entirety of the images seized and the state did not argue separate theories of guilt at trial, the offenses should have been merged.

      </p>
      <p>
       Lower courts properly denied defendant's suppression motion and convicted him of possessing child pornography because the various alleged misstatements and omissions in the search warrants were not material to the question of probable cause to issue the warrants, the alleged exculpatory evidence defendant claimed should have been presented to the grand jury was not the kind that tended to negate his guilt, the State could prosecute defendant for possessing the images even if he placed them on his computers and hard drives in another state, and the prosecutor presented defendant's case to the grand jury on the theory that he possessed the images that were stored on the computers and hard drives, not that he created them.
       Patterson v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. May 31, 2017) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction for distributing or possessing child pornography because based on the evidence, including a detective's testimony and the images themselves, a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the images on his digital devices depicted actual children; a detective testified, based on his own training and experience, that the images depicted actual children.
       O'Connor v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Apr. 10, 2019) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly sentenced defendant to four years to serve for violating his probation because defendant admitted to viewing child pornography on eight to 10 separate occasions and to deleting the web browser and all its contents after viewing the child pornography images, and while the sentence was at the high end of reasonable sentences that could be imposed for the violation, it was nevertheless supported by the record and was not clearly mistaken given defendant's “guarded” rehabilitation potential.
       Harris v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Oct. 21, 2020) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient for possession of child pornography convictions even though the images were found in the unallocated space of defendant’s computer that contained deleted data that had not yet been overwritten, but that could not be retrieved without specialized software. Defendant’s tax forms, school transcripts, and car manuals were found in the computer’s unallocated space.

       , pornography that was generated by the use of a child under the age of 18; the government had to prove that defendant knew that this child pornography was in his possession and that defendant acted knowingly with respect to the circumstance that the pornography was generated illegally.
       Ferrick v. State, 217 P.3d 418 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Jury instruction on "knowingly" did not plainly err because defendant admitted downloading child pornography, so the government had to show defendant knew the materials defendant possessed were produced using a child, and there was little chance the jury was misled to think defendant could be found guilty if defendant were aware of a substantial probability that defendant had distributed and presently possessed child pornography, given the way the case was litigated and argued. Ramos v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. July 18, 2018) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fair-minded juror could reasonably find that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew the victim was under eighteen years old, or, at the very least, he was aware of a "substantial probability" of that fact to which he was willfully blind, because the victim and defendant had been neighbors for six or seven years, and defendant had seen the victim grow up; there was also significant evidence that defendant knew that the victim was still in high school.

      <p>
       Where defendant pleaded no contest to three felonies as part of a plea bargain, his decision to plead no contest was not materially influenced by his mistaken understanding concerning the consequences of winning a suppression motion; trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea. Parker v. State, 90 P.3d 194 (Alaska Ct. App. 2004), rev'd, 147 P.3d 690 (Alaska 2006).

       Defendant’s separate convictions for exploitation of a minor and possession of child pornography had to merge when they were based on evidence that defendant took a sexually explicit photograph of his victim and then kept this photograph.
       Thompson v. State, 378 P.3d 707 (Alaska Ct. App. 2016), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 435 P.3d 947 (Alaska 2019).

        Merger with distribution charge. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in failing to merge defendant’s convictions for possession of child pornography and distribution of child pornography because the distribution charge was premised upon defendant’s possession of hundreds of images of child pornography. Because the charges were based on the entirety of the images seized and the state did not argue separate theories of guilt at trial, the offenses should have been merged.
       Ogletree v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 19, 2009) (memorandum decision).

       <b>
        Sentence. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case in which defendant was convicted of eight counts of possessing child pornography, when defendant was resentenced on remand as only a first felony offender, the resentencing judge did not increase defendant’s sentence by increasing his suspended time from 2 years to 7 years because that judge substantially reduced defendant’s active time to serve from 15 years to 7 years.
       Williams v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Mar. 2, 2022).
      </p>
      <p>
       Given defendant’s criminal history, including five or more class A misdemeanor convictions, and his risk of reoffending, the composite sentence imposed - 14 years with 7 years suspended (7 years to serve) for each count of possessing child pornography, with all sentences to run concurrently - was not excessive or clearly mistaken. Williams v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Mar. 2, 2022).

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s alleged lack of intent to distribute pornographic photographs and videos of children, purportedly evidenced by his concealment of them in a locked briefcase in a closet in his house, even if proven by clear and convincing evidence, did not mandate a “least serious” mitigator. State v. Parker, 147 P.3d 690 (Alaska 2006).

      <p>
       Where defendant was charged with sexual abuse of a minor, unlawful exploitation of a minor, distribution of child pornography, and possession of child pornography stemming from his sexual involvement with his girlfriend’s minor daughter, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to sever the sexual abuse charges from the pornography charges because all charges stemmed from defendant’s inappropriate relationship with the young girl and were connected.

       Defendant who was convicted of cruelty to animals and ordered to pay restitution to a rescue organization who found foster homes for the animals was not entitled to a credit, an offset, or a refund for monetary donations received by the organization from community members; moreover, because defendant’s probation forbade defendant from owning more than one animal, it followed that the trial court could order defendant to divest herself of the animals.

       District court properly ruled that the State's expert veterinarian could testify concerning the cause of a horse's death in defendant's trial for cruelty to animals because, while the expert did not conduct a necropsy, he was qualified to provide expert testimony as to the cause of the horse's death based on his background, training, and experience, scoring the horse's body condition based on the known pattern of fat accumulation in animals was scientifically valid, the conditions in which the expert found the body, and the conditions of the living animals (decided under former version of section).

       Trial court was not clearly mistaken by imposing a probationary term of 10 years for animal cruelty where it found that defendant had a hoarding problem so severe that it considered it an addiction that hurt others, defendant’s conduct resulted in the death of 40 to 70 dogs, he maintained his kennel as a business, he had a history of keeping too many dogs and had been told to reduce the size of his kennel, and the borough had previously euthanized 24 of defendant’s dogs for inadequate care.

       The State was required to prove two different culpable mental states; offense required proof of a particular type of conduct: knowing discharge of a firearm from an operated vehicle; proof was also required that defendant’s conduct created a specified result: the risk of physical injury to a person or damage to property.

       Defendant’s six convictions under this section had to be merged, and therefore the case was remanded for resentencing, because there was only one shooting, and the State erred by charging defendant with a separate count for each person who was endangered by the shooting.

       It was no error not to merge assault and weapons misconduct convictions because the first-degree assault statute concerned armed violence against individual victims resulting in serious harm, while the weapons misconduct statute concerned injury to one or more persons or property damage.

Lewis v. State, 9 P.3d 1028 (Alaska Ct. App. 2000).

       Paragraph (a)(1) requires proof of a nexus between a defendant’s possession of the firearm and the defendant’s commission of the felony drug offense, and the court’s findings must demonstrate that the state proved the nexus. Murray v. State, 12 P.3d 784 (Alaska Ct. App. 2000).

      <p>
       Where the trial court’s instruction did not allow the jury to consider the nexus element of the felony drug offense and possession or exercise of control over a firearm, the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; a jury reasonably could have found no connection between defendant’s possession of marijuana and his possession of the firearms.

       There was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict defendant of second-degree weapons misconduct.

         Constitutionality. —

       <p>
        This section which makes the possession of a gravity knife in one’s home a crime does not violate the right to privacy under the Alaska Constitution, art. I, § 22. State v. Weaver, 736 P.2d 781 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is a reasonable and rational attempt to achieve its apparent statutory goal of protecting the public from former felons possessing concealable firearms and is thus constitutional, though there will certainly be individual cases where it can be argued that the affirmative defenses set forth in subsection (b) are not perfect for accomplishing the section’s goal of protecting the public from former felons possessing concealable firearms. McCracken v. State, 743 P.2d 382 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (a), prohibiting a felon from possessing a concealable firearm, does not violate Alaska Const. art. I, § 19, by failing to differentiate between violent and non-violent felons. The legislature has the authority to regulate the possession of guns by felons, and that authority is not limited by art. I, § 19. Wilson v. State, 207 P.3d 565 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).

         Constitutional error held harmless. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial judge erred in having defendant take the stand and testify, as defendant was having obvious difficulty in understanding the law and deciding whether to testify; while this was constitutional error, it was harmless, as the defense conceded that defendant, a convicted felon, shot his mother, which supported his weapons misconduct conviction, plus he acted at least recklessly when he shot his mother, and there was no reasonable possibility that the jury would have reached a different verdict on the first-degree assault charge. Alvarez-Perdomo v. State, 425 P.3d 221 (Alaska Ct. App. 2018), rev'd, 454 P.3d 998 (Alaska 2019).

         Due process considerations. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The due process clause of the Alaska Constitution does not prohibit the state from convicting a defendant of a felon in possession of a concealable weapon charge when his former conviction was reversed on constitutional grounds. The Alaska court of appeals saw no reason why the legislature may not require that a person who has been convicted of a felony wait until that conviction has been reversed on appeal before being allowed to possess a concealable firearm. Clark v. State, 739 P.2d 777 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).

        Defendant was properly convicted of operating a vehicle under the influence of a controlled substance, driving with a revoked license, and third- and fourth-degree weapons misconduct because any error in placement of the burden of proof was irrelevant where the court's offer of a continuance for defense to prepare for trial was refused, the charges for third-degree weapons misconduct and operating under the influence and driving with a revoked license were properly joined, defendant was not unfairly prejudiced, and the double jeopardy clause was not violated where the weapons offenses implicated significantly different societal interests.

       Application of this section to persons who possess firearms while intoxicated in their homes or on their residential property is not violative of the constitutional right to privacy and to bear arms. Gibson v. State, 930 P.2d 1300 (Alaska Ct. App. 1997).

        Metal knuckles. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case in which defendant was convicted of fourth-degree weapons misconduct for possessing metal knuckles, defendant's weapon of metal knuckles with a short blade attached met the statutory definition of metal knuckles because the jury heard testimony from a trooper that the purpose of metal knuckles was to tenderize the body and break bones; and the trooper explained that a weapon like defendant's was used by wearing the knuckles with the knife pointed down so that the wearer could punch a person with the knuckles and then rake the knife across the person.
       Thrift v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. June 21, 2017) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if at least some knives are protected arms under the state constitution, metal knuckles do not become a protected arm when a short knife blade is attached to them; thus, defendant's weapon was not a constitutionally protected arm under the state constitution. Thrift v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. June 21, 2017) (memorandum decision).

        "Possession." —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly convicted defendant of third- and fourth-degree misconduct involving weapons for residing in a dwelling that contained a concealable firearm and possessing a firearm while impaired by a controlled substance because, inter alia, his attorney essentially invited the error of which defendant complained since defendant's mother's out-of-court statements and trial testimony would have been admissible as prior inconsistent statements and were corroborated by defendant's own statements in his 911 call about having "protection" and being "armed," defendant's sentence was not excessive, and the court properly rejected his proposed mitigator.
       Vars v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. June 30, 2021) (memorandum decision).

       <b>
        Separate punishment where defendant fired at cabin and truck. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Separate punishment upon conviction of two counts of misconduct involving weapons in the second degree, and two counts of criminal mischief in the third degree, where the evidence established that defendant had fired a rifle at a cabin and a pickup truck, did not violate the double jeopardy provisions of this section since there were sufficient and significant differences between the intent in the two firings.
       Leonard v. State, 655 P.2d 766 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982), overruled in part, Young v. State, 331 P.3d 1276 (Alaska Ct. App. 2014).

        “Knowingly.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant fired his gun through his car window into a car, which was parked in a lot full of other cars coming and going, the evidence was sufficient to show that the gun was fired recklessly, but the jury could find that he did not do so knowingly.
       Contreras v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Jan. 25, 2012) (memorandum decision).

      <p>
       <b>
        Merger properly denied. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in refusing to merge defendant's convictions of third-degree, fourth-degree, and fifth-degree weapons misconduct; a conviction for fifth-degree weapons misconduct did not merge with either of the other weapons offenses because it involved different conduct and was directed at a different societal interest, the protection of police officers by creating an affirmative duty to report any concealable deadly weapons.

       Because it was possible that the jury believed defendant possessed a firearm while impaired but had a reasonable doubt as to whether he hurt his wife or caused her to be afraid of him, and had a reasonable doubt as to whether he recklessly engaged in conduct that created a substantial risk of injury to the children, his conviction for misconduct involving weapons was not obviously inconsistent with verdicts acquitting him of assault and reckless endangerment.

       This section was not unconstitutionally vague, as applied to a defendant charged with carrying a long-bladed knife in a briefcase in violation of paragraph (a)(1), since it is clear that the phrase “on the person” encompasses purses, briefcases, and other hand-carried containers. De Nardo v. State, 819 P.2d 903 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).

       The phrase “on the person” is broad enough, without the additional word “about”, to encompass weapons concealed either in clothing or in purses, briefcases, or other hand-carried containers. De Nardo v. State, 819 P.2d 903 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).

       When defendant was arrested, he was carrying a steak knife, and failed to disclose the presence of the knife to the arresting officer as required under (a)(1)(A). A steak knife is a “deadly weapon” for purposes of this section. Liddicoat v. State, 268 P.3d 355 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011).

      <p>
       Defendant was properly convicted of fourth- and sixth-degree controlled substance misconduct because the evidence against him was obtained lawfully inasmuch as defendant voluntarily disclosed his possession of a pocket knife as soon as he was asked and readily consented to having a police officer take control of the knife for the duration of their encounter, and the discovery of a pipe and marijuana gave the officer an articulable reason to believe that defendant might be carrying additional evidence of a drug offense, which authorized the officer to conduct a pat-down search of the rest of defendant's pockets even though the officer had already decided that he was going to issue a summons to defendant and then allow him to leave.

       This section does not imply a legislative intent to create a privilege to conceal a weapon in an automobile, nor does it implicitly require state-wide uniformity of weapons regulations; thus, municipal ordinance interpreted as forbidding concealing of weapons in automobiles was not prohibited by this section.

       Trial court did not err in refusing to merge defendant's convictions of third-degree, fourth-degree, and fifth-degree weapons misconduct; a conviction for fifth-degree weapons misconduct did not merge with either of the other weapons offenses because it involved different conduct and was directed at a different societal interest, the protection of police officers by creating an affirmative duty to report any concealable deadly weapons.

      <p>
       Defendant was properly convicted of multiple drug and weapon felony offenses and sentenced to a composite term of 12 years and three months to serve because, inter alia, the totality of the circumstances known to the arresting officer gave rise to reasonable suspicion justifying an investigative stop, a ceremonial knife remained "concealed" since the officer could not readily identify the shiny metal object protruding out of defendant's bag as a knife, defendant's rights were not violated where defendant was timely taken before a judicial officer and a new bail was set at that first appearance, and, given the facts of the case and defendant's prior criminal history, the composite sentence was not clearly mistaken.

       Trial court was not required to merge defendant's convictions for soliciting second-degree sexual abuse of a minor and misdemeanor prostitution because the prostitution statute, consisting of offering a fee in return for sexual conduct, did not require proof of an unwilling or underage recipient of an offer incapable of informed consent.

       Customer’s testimony that he agreed to purchase sexual favors for sum of $200, his testimony that he charged the purchase price using his VISA card, and the VISA charge slip itself, were all highly probative of whether an agreement or offer to engage in sexual conduct in return for a fee was in fact made.

       Subsection (b) of this section, which expressly dispenses with mistake of age as a defense to promoting prostitution in the first degree, does not violate due process of law. Bell v. State, 668 P.2d 829 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the Revised Alaska Criminal Code, it is defendant’s intentional procurement of a person under the age of 16 years for prostitution that renders him liable for first-degree promoting, regardless of his actual awareness of that person’s age. Bell v. State, 668 P.2d 829 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The act of procuring another for purposes of prostitution is malum in se, without regard to the age of the person procured, and thus, in a prosecution for procuring a person under the age of 16 years, the intent to procure satisfies the minimal constitutional requirement of criminal intent. Bell v. State, 668 P.2d 829 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).

       Promoting prostitution in the second-degree count in defendant's indictment was not duplicitous on the ground that the count was allegedly based on two discrete criminal offenses — conduct before July 1, 2007 and conduct after July 1, 2007 — because, although the Alaska Legislature increased the seriousness of the offense from a class C to a class B felony part-way through defendant's continuing course of conduct, the Legislature did not change the underlying elements of the offense.

       Although the offense of second-degree promoting prostitution was raised from a class C to a class B felony in July 2007, defendant's jury expressly found that defendant committed the crime of second-degree promoting prostitution before and after July 1, 2007, the effective date of the amendment. Subjecting defendant to a class B felony sentence was therefore not improper because defendant was charged with committing a continuous course of conduct, and the jury found that it continued past July 1, 2007.

       A gambling device, or “gambling implement” has been defined as any tangible means, instrument or contrivance by which money may be lost or won as distinguished from the game itself, and the device need not be intended solely for gambling purposes. Pin-Ball Mach. v. State, 371 P.2d 805 (Alaska 1962).

       The three elements of gambling — price, chance and prize — are inherent in the make-up and operation of a pinball machine. State v. Pinball Mach., 404 P.2d 923 (Alaska 1965).
      </p>

       The element of chance is present in playing a pinball machine because the outcome — the number of free games that one may win — is not certain. State v. Pinball Mach., 404 P.2d 923 (Alaska 1965).

       It is not of the essence of gambling that the element of prize have a monetary market value.
       If that which one seeks to attain, regardless of whether it has value in money, may be attained by change after payment of a price, then one is gambling. State v. Pinball Mach., 404 P.2d 923 (Alaska 1965).

      Constitutionality of former law. —

     For case holding that former AS 17.10.010, 17.10.230(9), AS 17.12.010 and 17.12.150(7) were not void for vagueness. McKay v. State, 489 P.2d 145 (Alaska 1971).
    </p>
    <p>
     For cases construing constitutionality of former AS 17.12.010, which prohibited manufacturing, counterfeiting, possessing, selling, distributing, etc., a depressant, hallucinogenic, or stimulant drug, see Brown v. State, 565 P.2d 179 (Alaska 1977); Shine v. State, 596 P.2d 16 (Alaska 1979).

      Delay between offense and formal charge. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Some delay between offense and formal charge is clearly justified in cases involving drug undercover agents. McKay v. State, 489 P.2d 145 (Alaska 1971).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where the circumstances surrounding the drug transaction render the identification of the defendant unreliable, the disabilities inherent in a long delay between the date of the offense and the formal charge become manifestly prejudicial to the defendant. McKay v. State, 489 P.2d 145 (Alaska 1971).
    </p>
    <p>
     The time between the acts charged (July 8 and 16, 1969) and the indictment (Sept. 25, 1969) was not unreasonable and did not constitute a denial of due process in that the delay was purposeful, justifiable, and did not prejudice his ability to prepare a defense.
     McKay v. State, 489 P.2d 145 (Alaska 1971).
    </p>
    <p>
     A seven-month interval from the alleged drug sale until arrest was an unreasonable delay denying accused due process. McKay v. State, 489 P.2d 145 (Alaska 1971).
    </p>
    <p>
     Dismissal of the criminal proceedings was constitutionally mandated where eight months had elapsed between the occurrence of the alleged sale and the filing of the indictment. Marks v. State, 496 P.2d 66 (Alaska 1972).

        Consideration of quantity of drugs involved. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Judge was authorized to consider amount of drugs involved in sentencing for first-degree misconduct involving a controlled substance, although the small quantities mitigating factor had not been proven by clear and convincing evidence. Krack v. State, 973 P.2d 100 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Evidence sufficient. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for first-degree controlled substance misconduct under the theory that he engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise. He and his girlfriend made frequent trips to Seattle and New York to bring cocaine back to Alaska; he arranged and paid for at least four other women to travel to the lower 48 states and carry cocaine back to Alaska for him; used a clothing store he opened as a cover for his drug operation; and at the peak of the operation, he (through his drug couriers) was importing approximately one kilogram of cocaine per week into Alaska.
       Washington v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. May 25, 2011) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where seven witnesses testified that defendant would ask or tell them to take a trip to another city, provide money to buy the cocaine if necessary, and they would deliver cocaine to him on their return, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise.
       Williams v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Jan. 11, 2012) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that defendant ran a drug ring in Juneau was sufficient to warrant conviction under this section. Defendant could challenge the credibility of prosecution witnesses, former drug couriers for defendant, who had received favorable treatment in return for their testimony, but their credibility ultimately was a jury question. Further, while the witnesses were defendant’s accomplices, making it necessary to corroborate their testimony, the testimony of multiple accomplices may be used to corroborate each other.
       Williams v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Jan. 11, 2012) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Contingent warrants. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Judge violated the Fourth Amendment by issuing a contingent warrant that authorized the police to search defendant’s residence. The contingent event, requiring the police to first search another location and then find evidence of either first-degree or second-degree controlled substance misconduct, was not defined precisely enough to assure judicial control over the search process. Magee v. State, 77 P.3d 732 (Alaska Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Withdrawal of guilty plea denied. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant pleaded no contest to three felonies as part of a plea bargain, his decision to plead no contest was not materially influenced by his mistaken understanding concerning the consequences of winning a suppression motion; the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea. Parker v. State, 90 P.3d 194 (Alaska Ct. App. 2004), rev'd, 147 P.3d 690 (Alaska 2006).

      </p>
      <p>
       A composite sentence comprised of a 13-year component attributable to second-degree sexual abuse convictions and a 15-year term for drug offenses, while admittedly severe, was held to be not clearly mistaken. Krack v. State, 973 P.2d 100 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).

       Where, on appeal from a conviction of selling cocaine, the defendants argue that this section under which they were charged prohibits the sale only of natural or L-cocaine, derived from coca leaves, and where the state’s chemist testified on cross-examination that his tests did not exclude the possibility that the substance sold by the defendants was D-cocaine, an artificial compound not produced from coca leaves, but where the chemist also testified that to the best of his knowledge D-cocaine had never been synthesized in any quantity, the supreme court construing his testimony most favorably to the state, concluded that reasonable persons could find beyond a reasonable doubt that D-cocaine was not involved in the case and thus rejected the “D-cocaine” defense. LeDuff v. State, 618 P.2d 557 (Alaska 1980).

       Defendant’s claim that he should not have been treated as a repetitive cocaine seller, despite no contest pleas to three separate sales of cocaine, because police failed to arrest him after his first cocaine sale, thus making the subsequent sales possible, was without merit.

      <p>
       Where evidence of cocaine possession and sale would have been admissible on murder, kidnapping, and robbery charges, but the murder, robbery, and kidnapping evidence would not have been admissible on the cocaine charges, the appropriate action upon appeal from conviction on all counts was to vacate the cocaine convictions but affirm the other convictions.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s conviction for possessing cocaine with the intent to deliver was affirmed because the trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to suppress evidence obtained when narcotics enforcement officers subjected a package that he shipped through a private delivery service to inspection by a drug detection dog. The officers had received extensive specialized training in drug interdiction and in recognizing drug packages, and applied that training when they decided to have the package checked by the dog.

      <p>
       Although the police knew that defendant was involved in a dispute with his landlord, they had no indication that defendant had assaulted the landlord or had committed any illegal act; therefore, there was no basis for the officer to require defendant to stay at the scene and talk to him, and the cocaine that the police later found was seized as the result of an illegal investigative stop.

      <p>
       Where the informer who purchased bags of drugs from defendant testified and, thus, there was no break in the chain of custody of the bags, and where there was no evidence that the informer tampered with the bags, the fact that the informer was out of sight of the police for short periods of time before turning the bags over to the police went to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.

      <p>
       The superior court erred in failing to suppress evidence resulting from a warrantless patdown of the companion of a suspected drug courier because it did not determine whether the totality of the circumstances gave rise to articulable grounds supporting a reasonable suspicion that the companion was armed and dangerous and that an immediate patdown was required as a matter of practical necessity.

      </p>
      <p>
       The search of defendant’s watch pocket that revealed the crack cocaine was valid as a search incident to arrest, and the authority to search defendant was established by the arrest itself, because the crime of auto theft falls into the category of crimes, evidence of which can be concealed on the person. State v. Joubert, 20 P.3d 1115 (Alaska 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant, who was convicted of third-degree misconduct involving a controlled substance, challenged the search of a bag found in the car he was driving. The court incorrectly analyzed the circumstances, and failed to make necessary findings to properly uphold the search of a bag found under the driver’s seat as a search incident to arrest.

       The court of appeals reversed a defendant’s conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute where the jury could have understood the trial court’s instructions to require the defendant to terminate his possession of the cocaine by “throwing it away, destroying it, or by giving it to the police,” even though it could have believed that the defendant came into possession of the cocaine involuntarily and that he got rid of the cocaine as soon as possible by giving it to a third person to return it to the owner.

       Instruction on constructive possession did not have an impact on the jury's verdict because by finding that defendant possessed the drugs with the intent to manufacture or deliver them, the jury found that he had dominion and control over the drugs.

       Evidence before a grand jury was sufficient to support an indictment charging defendant with attempted misconduct involving a controlled substance in the third degree although the pills in question looked like illegal Ecstasy, but were fakes. The grand jury could reasonably have inferred that defendant believed the drugs were the illegal form of Ecstasy.

       Sentence of eight years with three years suspended on each of four counts of misconduct involving a controlled substance in the third degree, to be served concurrently, with a fine of $5,000 and 150 hours of community service per year of probation was affirmed where the defendant, who had no previous convictions, was integrally involved in what was described as the largest cocaine operation in the history of the state of Alaska.

       Based on defendant’s exceptionally aggravated offense, his recidivism, his lack of remorse, and his failure to take responsibility for his crimes, including extensive perjury at the sentencing hearing, sentencing judge could properly conclude that defendant’s prospects for rehabilitation were poor, and, given his status as a second felony offender, a sentence of seven years for third-degree controlled substance misconduct was not clearly mistaken.

       A sentence of eight years with three years suspended for misconduct involving cocaine was upheld where the amount of cocaine sold and the period of time spent selling drugs were considered as well as the defendant’s employment of a 17-year-old as an active and integral part of his illicit drug dealings.

       Consecutive sentences of six years with two years suspended on each of two counts of misconduct involving a controlled substance in the third degree were excessive where defendant, a first offender, was more properly classified as a courier of drugs and low level employee rather than a titan of the narcotics business.

       The court of appeals also believed that the presumptive sentences established by the revised criminal code for the defendant’s most serious offense should constitute a ceiling on his sentence.

       Sentence to a composite term in excess of ten years of unsuspended incarceration for convictions of multiple counts of misconduct involving controlled substances in both the second and third degrees and for theft in the second degree was excessive, as defendants were first felony offenders apparently amenable to rehabilitation, and the evidence did not establish a public safety need to isolate them for more than ten years.

      <p>
       A composite sentence of eight years, with four years suspended, upon conviction of four counts of misconduct involving a controlled substance in the third degree, was excessive where, although defendant had dealt in large quantities of cocaine, he was still entitled to be sentenced as a first felony offender.

      <p>
       Sentence of four years to serve (composite term of six years with two years suspended) was held excessive for conviction of three counts of selling cocaine, where defendant’s case was determined to lie in the middle of the benchmark sentencing range, based on the small retail quantity of the sales, remoteness of his criminal history from the present offense, and absence of prior drug offenses.

        Origin of statute. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       As with the balance of Alaska’s revised drug laws, the crack-house provision derives from the Uniform Controlled Substances Act Title 21 U.S.C. Dawson v. State, 894 P.2d 672 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).

       Right of privacy does not permit reasonable access to cocaine for personal and social use. State v. Erickson, 574 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a sufficiently close and substantial relationship between the means chosen to regulate cocaine and the legislative purpose of preventing harm to health and welfare so as to justify the prohibition of use of cocaine, even in the home. State v. Erickson, 574 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s attack on the constitutionality of subparagraphs (a)(3)(F) and (a)(3)(G) of this section was rejected where defendant’s argument was contrary to appellate rulings in other decisions; the notion that people had the fundamental right to ingest marijuana had previously been rejected; the legislature had the right to set reasonable limits on the amount of marijuana people could possess and use in their homes. Garhart v. State, 147 P.3d 746 (Alaska Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Keep and maintain. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The plain meaning of “keep” and “maintain” should govern the application of Alaska’s crack-house statute. The statute must be construed to require a finding of continuity and to preclude conviction for an isolated incident of possession or distribution. Dawson v. State, 894 P.2d 672 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       For a person to “keep” or “maintain” a structure in violation of the crack-house statute, the person must control or have authority to control the use or occupancy of the structure. Dawson v. State, 894 P.2d 672 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for violation of paragraph (a)(5), an instruction was proper that the jurors that the element of “keep or maintain” was satisfied if the state proved that defendant: (a) “knowingly allowed” (i.e., defendant was aware of and permitted); (b) other people to conduct “business operations” (i.e., continuing sales of cocaine); (c) in an apartment that defendant either “controlled or had the right to control either through ownership lease.” Wahrer v. State, 901 P.2d 442 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       The crack house statute requires proof that defendant kept or maintained the premises, and allegation that defendant exercised physical or psychological dominance over the other residents of the premises does not establish the element of proof required by this section. Collins v. State, 977 P.2d 741 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The words “keep” and “maintain” in (a)(5) require the state to demonstrate continuity or duration, and the purpose with which a person uses property and whether such use is continuous are issues of fact to be decided on the totality of the evidence in each case; however, the state is not required to prove more than a single specific incident involving the keeping or distribution of drugs if other evidence of continuity exists. Murray v. State, 12 P.3d 784 (Alaska Ct. App. 2000).

       prohibited knowingly keeping or maintaining a dwelling “that was used for keeping or distributing controlled substances in violation of a felony offense;” the plain language of the statute appeared to criminalize behavior beyond maintaining the structure for distributing controlled substances and it was not plain error for the trial court to instruct the jury accordingly.

      <p>
       The existence of continuity presents a factual issue to be decided in light of the totality of the facts in each case. Incidental use of the property for keeping or distributing drugs or a single, isolated occurence of drug-related activity will not suffice. Dawson v. State, 894 P.2d 672 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).

      <p>
       The property must be used for the purpose of keeping or distributing drugs in a manner that amounts to a felony under Alaska’s drug laws. Use for purposes of committing misdemeanor grade controlled substance offenses is excluded from the language of the crack-house statute. Dawson v. State, 894 P.2d 672 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).

       After the police served a search warrant at their cabin and discovered an illegal marijuana grow operation, the magistrate could properly rely on information about electricity usage at the cabin when deciding whether to issue the warrant. The magistrate was provided with information that affirmatively linked the amount of electricity usage to the amount of marijuana that might be growing inside.

       Defendant’s conviction for maintaining a building for keeping or distributing controlled substances under this section had to be merged with his convictions for possessing and manufacturing marijuana. Under a complicity theory, defendant’s composite conviction on three counts of possessing or manufacturing marijuana essentially encompassed his conduct of maintaining a building. Rofkar v.

       McDonald v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Apr. 22, 2015) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant was convicted of both growing, distributing, or possessing an ounce or more of marijuana for purposes of distribution and of maintaining a building where the activity took place, and with respect to the second count the State’s theory was that defendant was guilty of maintaining a building because he stored and processed the marijuana in his residence and an associated outbuilding, the two convictions had to merge.
       McGraw v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 19, 2015) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s convictions for knowingly manufacturing one ounce or more of marijuana, knowingly possessing one pound or more of marijuana, knowingly possessing 25 or more marijuana plants, and maintaining a structure for the purpose of keeping or distributing controlled substances in violation of a felony provision of the drug laws merged, for double jeopardy purposes, because (1) the possession counts were based on possession of the same marijuana, and (2) the manufacturing and possession counts were not distinct criminal acts, as there was no reason to distinguish between the act of growing marijuana and the act of possessing the same marijuana once it was grown.

       In order to be convicted of misconduct involving a controlled substance, defendant need only to have delivered a combination of ingredients that included marijuana; it is the total weight of the entire substance delivered that determines the degree of the offense. Gibson v. State, 719 P.2d 687 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The weight of marijuana should be determined absent stalks, fiber and sterilized seeds. Gibson v. State, 719 P.2d 687 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the state presented evidence that although the bud of the plant was the most marketable and desirable form of marijuana, the leaves of the plant had value and were used by marijuana users; prior case law was also consistent with including marijuana leaves in determining the weight of live marijuana plants, and therefore, the trial court did not err in giving an instruction that allowed the jury to consider the marijuana leaves as commonly used marijuana in determining the aggregate weight of the marijuana.

       Where defendants were charged with selling marijuana to a minor in violation of former AS 17.12, the purchaser’s age had no bearing on the question of whether the defendants were guilty of a violation.

       , that defendant was on probation from that prior federal felony when he committed the present offense. With respect to aggravator (c)(7), under Alaska law, robbery in any form was a more serious class of felony than possession of cocaine without intent to distribute, and as to aggravator (c)(20), while it was unclear whether the trial court actually relied on that factor, because it was undisputed that defendant was a felony probationer when he committed his current offense, any error in the trial court’s having failed to give him a jury trial on that issue was harmless.

       Superior court erred in finding that defendant, convicted of fourth-degree controlled substance misconduct, was not eligible for mitigation where his offense involved only small quantities of drugs; defendant possessed only a few grams more than the 28.35 grams he had to possess to make his conduct a felony.

      </p>
      <p>
       Sentence of five years imprisonment with two years suspended imposed on defendant convicted of fourth-degree controlled substance misconduct was remanded in part because superior court failed to consider whether defendant’s prior felony convictions for first-degree robbery and first-degree assault had to be treated as one felony; record showed that both the state and defendant’s counsel believed that defendant should have been sentenced as a second felony offender, however superior court decided that defendant should be sentenced as a third felony offender without seeking the input of the parties and without addressing the issue of whether there was a substantial change in the nature of the criminal objective during the events that led to defendant’s prior felony convictions.

       Most of the cases cited in the notes below were decided under former AS 17.12.

        Neither the federal or Alaska constitution affords protection for the buying or selling of marijuana.

       <b>
        Constitutionality of punishment for possession of marijuana. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Imposition of criminal punishment for possession of marijuana did not violate the constitutional prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Belgarde v. State, 543 P.2d 206 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where possession of marijuana occurred in a public place and was in connection with the sale of a substantial amount of that drug, even though his conviction was for possessing the drug rather than for being an accomplice to its sale, the state could constitutionally prohibit defendant’s possession. Belgarde v. State, 543 P.2d 206 (Alaska 1975).

       <b>
        Search and seizure. —

       did not authorize arrest for a misdemeanor that was not committed in officers’ presence because officers did not see the transactions reported to police, this argument was rejected because defendant did not raise this issue in superior court and information police had when they contacted defendant established a substantial chance that defendant had committed a felony by selling a drug other than a small quantity of marijuana. Duncan v. State, 178 P.3d 467 (Alaska Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Right of privacy. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since eight ounces or more of marijuana is an amount large enough to justify legislative regulation even when it is possessed in a residence for purely personal use, this section does not offend the right of privacy guaranteed by the state Constitution. Walker v. State, 991 P.2d 799 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Possession at home with intent to sell. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Possession at home of amounts of marijuana indicative of intent to sell rather than possession for personal use is unprotected by the Alaska Constitution. Ravin v. State, 537 P.2d 494 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Possession at home for personal use. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Possession of marijuana by adults at home for personal use is constitutionally protected. Ravin v. State, 537 P.2d 494 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Citizens of the State of Alaska have a basic right to privacy in their homes under Alaska’s constitution. This right to privacy would encompass the possession and ingestion of substances such as marijuana in a purely personal, noncommercial context in the home unless the state can meet its substantial burden and show that proscription of possession of marijuana in the home is supportable by achievement of a legitimate state interest. Ravin v. State, 537 P.2d 494 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       No adequate justification for the state’s intrusion into the citizen’s right to privacy by its prohibition of possession of marijuana by an adult for personal consumption in the home has been shown. Ravin v. State, 537 P.2d 494 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Age of purchaser. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendants were charged with selling marijuana to a minor in violation of former AS 17.12, the purchaser’s age had no bearing on the question of whether the defendants were guilty of a violation.
       The purchaser’s age was important only in determining the punishment that could be imposed for that offense. Morris v. State, 630 P.2d 13 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Convictions for possession and contraband promotion did not violate double jeopardy. —

       , the conviction of the drug possession offenses and the conviction of the contraband possession offense did not violate double jeopardy prohibitions because these were separate crimes involving separate societal interests; moreover, one offense was not a lesser-included offense of another. Lampkin v. State, 141 P.3d 362 (Alaska Ct. App. 2006).

      <p>
       In order to be charged with misconduct involving a controlled substance involving marijuana, a person must be in possession of a substance that contains its seeds, leaves, buds or flowers; merely possessing stalks, fibers or sterilized seeds would not be enough. Gibson v. State, 719 P.2d 687 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).

        Aggregate weight. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to be convicted of misconduct involving a controlled substance, defendant need only to have delivered a combination of ingredients that included marijuana; it is the total weight of the entire substance delivered that determines the degree of the offense. Gibson v. State, 719 P.2d 687 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The weight of marijuana should be determined absent stalks, fiber and sterilized seeds. Gibson v. State, 719 P.2d 687 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was adequate to support a conclusion that defendant was guilty of attempted possession of a controlled substance. The jury knew that defendant actively tracked the whereabouts of a package containing pain killers, knew when the package should have arrived, and called the post office to determine the package’s whereabouts when it was not delivered.

       Former paragraph (a)(3), which established 19 years as the age of majority for the purpose of regulating the possession of marijuana, did not violate the Alaska Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. Allam v. State, 830 P.2d 435 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).

       Appellees did not have a strong claim of need for a pre-enforcement decision on the constitutionality of this section because their current practices were and would remain illegal and expose them to a risk of criminal prosecution under federal law regardless of any ruling the supreme court might make.

        Significance of legislative amendments. —

      </p>
      <p>
       In 1982 the Alaska legislature amended this section to legalize possession of up to four ounces of marijuana in a private place, but in 1990 the voters passed an initiative re-criminalizing all use and possession of marijuana, and the legislature consequently amended this section in 1990 to re-criminalize the possession of four ounces or less of marijuana in a private place. Brown v. Ely, 14 P.3d 257 (Alaska 2000).

       <b>
        Possession of marijuana in public place in connection with sale. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where possession of marijuana occurred in a public place and was in connection with the sale of a substantial amount of that drug, even though his conviction was for possessing the drug rather than for being an accomplice to its sale, the state could constitutionally prohibit defendant’s possession.

       Given the evidence of the effect of marijuana on driving, an individual’s right to possess or ingest marijuana while driving would be subject to the prohibition provided for in this section. Ravin v. State, 537 P.2d 494 (Alaska 1975).

       The need for control of drivers under the influence of marijuana and the existing doubts as to the safety of marijuana demonstrate a sufficient justification for the prohibition found in this section as an exercise of the state’s police power for the public welfare.

       Initiative legislation that reinstated certain penalties for possession of marijuana in any place and in any amount was unconstitutional to the extent that it violated the constitutional right to privacy as articulated in the Ravin decision; the appellate court upheld the statute to the extent possible by reinstating a dividing line between private personal possession and illegal possession of four ounces, and ordered a new trial to determine which category of possession defendant fell into.

       Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s conviction for sixth-degree controlled substance misconduct (possession of marijuana) because defendant’s arguments to the contrary required construing the evidence in the light most favorable to defendant, which was not the standard for reviewing sufficiency of the evidence.

       Some of the cases cited in the notes below were decided under former AS 17.10.

      <p>
       <b>
        Regulation of cocaine. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Word “narcotic” in common usage includes cocaine although cocaine is not a narcotic pharmacologically. State v. Erickson, 574 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature specifically intended to regulate the use and possession of cocaine, regardless of its particular pharmacological status. State v. Erickson, 574 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Constitutionality of classification of cocaine as narcotic. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The classification of cocaine with narcotics under former AS 17.10 was not violative of equal protection or due process. State v. Erickson, 574 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       When viewed from the overall legislative purpose of preventing the use of a drug harmful to the health and welfare of society, the classification of cocaine as a narcotic drug was not so irrational or arbitrary as to violate due process. State v. Erickson, 574 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Cocaine was not unconstitutionally classified as a narcotic drug by former AS 17.10. Johnson v. State, 577 P.2d 230 (Alaska 1978).

      <p>
       Where, on appeal from a conviction of selling cocaine, the defendants argue that this section under which they were charged prohibits the sale only of natural or L-cocaine, derived from coca leaves, and where the state’s chemist testified on cross-examination that his tests did not exclude the possibility that the substance sold by the defendants was D-cocaine, an artificial compound not produced from coca leaves, but where the chemist also testified that to the best of his knowledge D-cocaine had never been synthesized in any quantity, the supreme court construing his testimony most favorably to the state, concluded that reasonable persons could find beyond a reasonable doubt that D-cocaine was not involved in the case and thus rejected the “D-cocaine” defense. LeDuff v. State, 618 P.2d 557 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s claim that he should not have been treated as a repetitive cocaine seller, despite no contest pleas to three separate sales of cocaine, because police failed to arrest him after his first cocaine sale, thus making the subsequent sales possible, was without merit.

       Where the facts of a case show knowing possession of illegal drugs, it was unnecessary that a usable quantity be found so long as a sufficient quantity of the drug was found to permit proper identification.
       If all of the evidence in the case, taken together, supported the jury’s findings of knowing possession beyond a reasonable doubt, the conviction was proper. Lee v. State, 511 P.2d 1076 (Alaska 1973) (decided under former AS 17.10).

       Under the definition of “delivery” found in this section, a person who acts as a go-between or facilitator for an illegal drug transaction can be prosecuted and convicted as an accomplice to the delivery even though he or she is acting on behalf of the purchaser.

      <p>
       The definition of marijuana in this section is for the purpose of determining whether or not a person could be charged with marijuana possession or delivery, but has nothing to do with determining aggregate weight. Gibson v. State, 719 P.2d 687 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is clear that this statutory definition of marijuana is not controlling when the aggregate weight of marijuana is at issue in a given case; rather, that issue is governed by AS

      <p>
       A person of common intelligence reading the definition of “sale” in the former narcotics law might well understand such definition as including an agent of a purchaser as well as an agent of a seller, particularly in light of the obvious expansion in the definitions of the concept of “sale” as it is commonly used in a commercial context.
       The fact that some courts might judicially construe the definition of “sale” in such a way as to narrow its scope to exclude purchasers’ agents hardly renders the entire definition unconstitutionally vague. McKay v. State, 489 P.2d 145 (Alaska 1971).

       Trial court properly allowed the State to present evidence of the scale and residue found in defendant's wallet because it tended to make it more likely that he was aware of the heroin in his wallet and that the morphine in his blood was the result of heroin ingestion rather than medication, and, while the trial court should have granted defendant's request for a factual unanimity instruction, both defendant and the State agreed that he was indicted and prosecuted for possession of the heroin in his wallet, not the brown residue on the scale, and the jury could not have concluded that the substance was an "immediate precursor" or convicted defendant based on the residue on the scale.

       Statutory definition of marijuana included “the seeds, and leaves, buds, and flowers” of the marijuana plant and prior case law was also consistent with including marijuana leaves in determining the weight of live marijuana plants; therefore, the trial court did not err in giving an instruction that allowed the jury to consider the marijuana leaves as commonly used marijuana in determining the aggregate weight of the marijuana.

       In party activists’ suit challenging the constitutionality of Alaska’s statutory limitations on soft money contributions to political parties from individuals and corporations, the action was not moot, despite the repeal of two challenged provisions, because the activists would likely experience prosecution and civil penalties for their past violations of the repealed provisions. Jacobus v. Alaska, 338 F.3d 1095 (9th Cir. Alaska 2003), overruled in part, Bd. of Trs. of the Glazing Health &amp; Welfare Trust v. Chambers, 941 F.3d 1195 (9th Cir. Nev. 2019).

       In determining whether a regulation is authorized by statute the Court of Appeals of Alaska looks to four things:
       First, the scope of authority conferred by the authorizing statute; second, the extent to which the regulation is in accordance with “standards prescribed by other provisions of law”; third, the extent to which the regulation is consistent with the authorizing statute; and fourth, the extent to which the regulation is reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose of the authorizing statute.

       Denial of appellant’s motion to correct what he claimed were illegal sentences was proper because he was sentenced under the post-2005 sentencing law, and thus his facial challenge to Alaska’s sentencing scheme failed. Moreover, both of appellant’s sentences were proper since they did not exceed the presumptive range for his offenses, and the judge was thus authorized to impose the sentences in each case without the need to find aggravating factors.

       In a trial for robbery and kidnapping placing the burden to prove duress on defendant was constitutional, since the statutes as to robbery and kidnapping prohibit particular action undertaken with a particular objective, and because Alaska does not consider duress to be the negation of specific intent, duress may, consistent with due process, be treated as an affirmative defense.

        When defense is available. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The necessity defense is available if a person acted in the reasonable belief that an emergency existed and there were no alternatives available even if that belief was mistaken. Moreover, the person’s actions should be weighed against the harm reasonably foreseeable at the time, rather than the harm that actually occurs.
       Nelson v. State, 597 P.2d 977 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defense of necessity may be raised if the defendant’s actions, although violative of the law, were necessary to prevent an even greater harm from occurring. Nelson v. State, 597 P.2d 977 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        There are three essential elements to the defense of necessity:
       </b>
       1) the act charged must have been done to prevent a significant evil; 2) there must have been no adequate alternative; and 3) the harm caused must not have been disproportionate to the harm avoided. Nelson v. State, 597 P.2d 977 (Alaska 1979); Cleveland v. Municipality of Anchorage, 631 P.2d 1073 (Alaska 1981).

        The defense of necessity is available if the accused reasonably believed

      </p>
      <p>
       Although defendant argued that she had presented some evidence to satisfy a jury instruction on a necessity defense, trial court erred in denying State’s motion to preclude defendant from arguing the necessity defense because defendant presented no evidence that would allow a reasonable person to find that driving intoxicated was safer than any alternative.

      <p>
       Trial court erred in convicting defendant, upon a jury verdict, of second-degree vehicle theft for taking another person's dirt bike because the trial court misallocated the burden of proof with respect to defendant's necessity defense; the State did not contest that defendant was entitled to a necessity instruction, and, given that the language in the vehicle theft statutes was drawn directly from the criminal mischief statutes, the State had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had no right or reasonable ground to believe that his act of taking the dirt bike was justified.

       , encompasses any reasonable ground to believe that a legal justification for causing the alleged property damage existed; since subsection (a) of that section unambiguously defines the essential elements of criminal mischief to include the absence of “any reasonable ground to believe the person has such a right,” the state bears the burden of proof on this element once an issue of justification is raised. McGee v. State, 162 P.3d 1251 (Alaska 2007).

       </cite>
       defines the offense of criminal mischief to allow conviction only when property damage is intentionally caused by a person “having no right to do so or any reasonable ground to believe the person has such a right;” the statute’s plain language makes the absence of any “right” or “reasonable ground” a necessary ingredient of criminal mischief, thus requiring the state to bear the burden of proof on the issue once it is raised; to the extent that this allocation of the burden conflicts with the code’s general provision adopting necessity as an affirmative defense for the defendant to prove, the criminal mischief statute’s specific requirement would prevail by the general provision’s own terms, since the criminal mischief law would be a “statute defining the offense” in a manner that “provides exemptions or defenses dealing with the justification.” McGee v.

       Necessity instruction should have been given in a trial for driving under the influence because defendant testified that she believed she was about to be attacked by her former boyfriend and that after reaching his parents’ house to warn them of a potential danger to them, she did not stay because she had reason to believe the boyfriend would return there. Her other actions, such as stopping of her own accord in a well-lighted area, where she waited for police until she flagged them down, were consistent with her understanding of the necessity—her need to escape from her former boyfriend and to warn his parents by waking them.

The trial court erred in concluding that the potential damage to defendant’s vessel and equipment and the destruction of the salmon catch onboard defendants’ vessel resulting from the hydraulic spill did not constitute a significant evil for purposes of the necessity defense.

       A defendant claiming self-defense as justification for the use of force must prove that they acted to avoid what was reasonably perceived to be a threat of imminent harm. A defendant’s reasonable belief that harm will come at some future time is not sufficient to support a claim of self-defense or defense of others. Xi Van Ha v. State, 892 P.2d 184 (Alaska Ct.

       When a homicide defendant asserts that he or she acted in self-defense, the law does not require the defendant to prove that he or she actually faced imminent deadly attack. Even if the defendant’s fear turns out to have been mistaken, the defense still may be established if the defendant proves that, under the circumstances, he or she reasonably feared imminent deadly attack at the hand of the victim.

       In assault case, evidence of specific instances of the victim’s violent conduct was necessary to enable the jury to determine how much force a reasonable person with defendant’s knowledge of the victim’s propensity for violence would have felt compelled to use in self-defense. Amarok v. State, 671 P.2d 882 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).

       Jury properly rejected defendant’s theory of self-defense where there was ample evidence from which reasonable jurors could have concluded that the victim was not threatening defendant with deadly force at the time defendant stabbed the victim. Morrell v. State, 216 P.3d 574 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of assault in the first degree for stabbing the victim in the hand with a knife and causing him serious physical injury. Defendant did not act in self-defense and was not justified in using deadly force because the victim was attempting to leave when defendant confronted him.

       An insured pled no contest to a violation of Anchorage, Alaska, Municipal Code 08.30.120(A)(6), to the prong of the ordinance prohibiting a person from challenging another to fight. Accordingly, the insured was precluded from claiming coverage under an insurance policy because the insured could not “knowingly challenge another to fight” and subsequently claim self-defense in a criminal prosecution. Alaska’s self-defense statute prohibits a person from relying on self-defense where “the person claiming self-defense was the initial aggressor.” Bearden v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas.

      <p>
       Where the jury was misinstructed regarding the scope of force that a corrections officer could lawfully use against an inmate, defendant’s assault conviction was reversed; there was a substantial possibility that the verdict would have been different if an instruction under 22 AAC 05.060 had been given. Bachmeier v. State, 276 P.3d 494 (Alaska Ct. App. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court's denial of defendant's request for a self-defense instruction was error where defendant testified that he suffered impact to his head and did not remember portions of the events that occurred, his denials of using force generally included a qualification, and his testimony that he was severely injured by a safety officer's unprovoked assault, along with the officer's testimony that he shocked defendant with a taser, pepper sprayed him, tackled him, and hit him with a baton, provided circumstantial evidence that defendant actually believed that it was necessary to use force in self-defense.
       Priser v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. July 17, 2019) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the trial court gave an incorrect instruction on the law of self-defense, the error did not appreciably affect the jury's verdict because, when a supplemental instruction was read in conjunction with the other jury instructions on self-defense, and in the context of the parties' closing arguments, there was little chance that the jurors were misled. Jones-Nelson v. State, 446 P.3d 797 (Alaska Ct. App. 2019), rev'd, — P.3d — (Alaska 2022).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a well-established nexus between defendant's use of force and his willing participation in a drug transaction, as defendant testified that he went to the victim's residence intending to buy an ounce of marijuana, his friend testified he had about an ounce of marijuana when he returned to the campsite, and the jury instruction made it clear that the transaction had to be a felony transaction. The instructions were sufficient to ensure that if the jury rejected defendant's self-defense claim it did so because it found that defendant possessed a deadly weapon while participating in a felony drug transaction. Green v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 11, 2021) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though the jury instruction failed to tell the jurors that they were required to evaluate defendant's use of force from the perspective of a reasonable person in defendant's circumstances, the trial court did not err by denying defendant a new trial because the remaining jury instructions and closing arguments as a whole correctly articulated the reasonableness principle and defendant was not prejudiced. Green v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 11, 2021) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a trial for first-degree murder, a self-defense instruction was contrary to the statutory requirements because the disputed instruction erroneously suggested that the jury should evaluate the use of deadly force retrospectively to determine whether deadly force was in fact objectively necessary, rather than whether the defendant’s use of deadly force was reasonable under the circumstances known to the defendant at the time.

       In prosecution for first-degree assault while it was only defendant’s own testimony which supported his theory that he entered the party house in a non-aggressive manner with the sole intention of conversing with the victim, there was some evidence that defendant did not provoke a dispute with victim under circumstances that he knew or should have known would result in mortal combat, and therefore defendant was entitled to have his self-defense claim, weak as it may have been, properly determined by the jury.

       <b>
        Self-defense not shown. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence established that the victim was killed by repeated blows to his face while he was lying on his back, and there was no evidence that he had a weapon or ever threatened to kill defendant; accordingly, the evidence was legally sufficient to support the verdict of manslaughter and the conclusion that the State had proven that defendant did not act in self-defense. O'Neil v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 26, 2015) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was legally sufficient to support defendant's first-degree murder conviction; although defendant claimed self-defense, even if the jury believed that the victim brought the knife to the encounter and that defendant had disarmed him, defendant went looking for the victim and attacked the victim even after he retreated, and thus defendant acted with the intent to kill.
       Kone v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Oct. 31, 2018) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Standards by which party attacked may act. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where one is attacked by another with a deadly weapon, the party attacked may, if he does so honestly and in good faith, safely act in the light of his surroundings, and on the appearances to him at the time. Owens v. United States, 130 F. 279, 2 Alaska Fed. 278 (9th Cir. Alaska 1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       To employ self-defense a defendant must satisfy both an objective and subjective standard; he must have actually believed deadly force was necessary to protect himself, and his belief must be one that a reasonable person would have held under the circumstances. Weston v. State, 682 P.2d 1119 (Alaska 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Focus on circumstances as they appear to reasonable person. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The defense of self-defense in a prosecution for manslaughter requires that the circumstances be such that a reasonable person would believe that she was in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury; thus the focus is on the circumstances as they would appear to a reasonable person, and the intoxication of the appellant is not germane to that question since an actual belief may be entertained regardless of whether one is intoxicated.
       Nygren v. State, 616 P.2d 20 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Unreasonable subjective belief as defense. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An unreasonable subjective belief as to justification for use of deadly force may be used as a defense to reduce murder to manslaughter. Weston v. State, 656 P.2d 1186 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982), rev'd, 682 P.2d 1119 (Alaska 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on self-defense in an assault case because any theory of self-defense was purely speculative.
       Clarke v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Nov. 4, 2009) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Testimony of witnesses varied significantly in relation to the circumstances surrounding a knife fight where the defendant stabbed the victim several times and caused significant injury to the victim’s hand. Conviction under this section was proper because the jury weighed the evidence and rejected defendant’s self-defense claim.
       Delgreco v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Oct. 26, 2011) (memorandum decision).
      </p>

       <b>
        A person who provokes a difficulty forfeits his right to self-defense.
       </b>
       This doctrine has been extended to preclude a person who commits a felony from claiming self-defense not only to the intended victim of the felony, but also as to any person intervening in an attempt either to prevent the crime or to apprehend the criminal. Gray v. State, 463 P.2d 897 (Alaska), limited, Wilson v. State, 473 P.2d 633 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the defendant commits a felony which includes an immediate threat of violence, he has created a situation so fraught with peril as to preclude his claim of self-defense to any act of violence arising therefrom.
       This holding is limited to the situation where the armed robbery is still in progress and where there is grave danger of violence, injury, or loss of life because a weapon is being used to consummate the felony. Gray v. State, 463 P.2d 897 (Alaska), limited, Wilson v. State, 473 P.2d 633 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       A person who commits an armed robbery forfeits his right to claim as a defense the necessity to protect himself against the use of excessive force by either the intended victim of the robbery or by any person intervening to prevent the crime or to apprehend the criminal, absent a factual showing that at the time the violence occurred, the dangerous situation created by the armed robbery no longer existed. Gray v. State, 463 P.2d 897 (Alaska), limited, Wilson v. State, 473 P.2d 633 (Alaska 1970).

        Exceptions to forfeiture by aggressor. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An aggressor forfeits the right to claim self-defense except in two situations: (1) where an aggressor using nondeadly force (i.e., one who begins an encounter, using only his fists or some nondeadly weapon) is met with deadly force, the initial aggressor may justifiably defend himself against the deadly attack; (2) when an aggressor withdraws from the altercation that he has started, he may then defend himself from further attack. Castillo v. State, 614 P.2d 756 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Use of unnecessary force by officer. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       If an officer uses unnecessary force in making a lawful arrest and the person sought to be arrested believes, and has reason to believe, that he is in danger of being killed or of receiving great bodily harm, he may defend himself, even to the point of taking the life of the officer.
       The rule of self-defense applies to the case of an officer attempting to make an arrest, who abuses his authority and transcends the bounds thereof by the use of unnecessary force and violence as well as to the case of a private individual who unlawfully uses such force and violence. Gray v. State, 463 P.2d 897 (Alaska), limited, Wilson v. State, 473 P.2d 633 (Alaska 1970).

       The possibility of retirement by a defendant fearful of his life is not in issue unless at the time of the affray he was an intruder upon the ground where the killing occurred. De Groot v. United States, 78 F.2d 244, 5 Alaska Fed. 785 (9th Cir. Alaska 1935).

      </p>
      <p>
       Threats unaccompanied at the time of the killing with any attempt to carry them into execution are insufficient to justify homicide. Ball v. United States, 147 F. 32, 2 Alaska Fed. 536 (9th Cir. Alaska 1906).

       <b>
        Threat of deadly force not supported by evidence. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although evidence did show that victim, having learned about common-law wife’s affair with another man, was at times angry and threatening in the days before his death, these pre-event occurrences suggested nothing more than motive and a possible willingness on victim’s part to use deadly force at some future time; none of the evidence concerning the circumstances surrounding the shooting itself supported the conclusion that victim’s prior expressions of anger culminated in an actual use or threat of deadly force by victim, or that his killer acted in the reasonable belief that the use of deadly force in self-defense was necessary to protect against victim. Hilbish v. State, 891 P.2d 841 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).

       Although the State offered no motive for defendant’s attack on the victim and defendant was bleeding from a wound to his thigh when the police stopped his car, under all of the evidence, any argument that defendant acted in self-defense or as a result of serious provocation by the victim would have been based on pure speculation and defendant’s request for jury instructions on self-defense and heat of passion was properly denied. Hamilton v. State, 59 P.3d 760 (Alaska Ct. App. 2002), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 915, 124 S. Ct. 302, 157 L. Ed. 2d 209 (U.S. 2003).

       Whether or not under all the circumstances the accused pleading self-defense had the right to stand his ground depends upon a conclusion of fact, which conclusion is one for the jury. Frank v. United States, 42 F.2d 623, 5 Alaska Fed. 523 (9th Cir. Alaska 1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even a weak or implausible self-defense claim is a question for the jury. Folger v. State, 648 P.2d 111 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).

       Burden is on defendant to produce some evidence in support of claim of self-defense before he is entitled to jury instruction. Folger v. State, 648 P.2d 111 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).

        When burden sustained. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of establishing self-defense is sustained when, as a result of the whole evidence, a reasonable doubt has been created in the minds of the jury as to whether or not the homicide was in self-defense.
       If, from a consideration of the whole evidence, the jury entertains a reasonable doubt upon that question, that doubt is to be determined, like all other doubts in the case, in favor of the defendant. Frank v. United States, 42 F.2d 623, 5 Alaska Fed. 523 (9th Cir. Alaska 1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       On the issue of self-defense, where the prosecution rests with bare proof of the homicide, the burden of going forward with the evidence is on the defendant, and he must offer proof of facts upon that issue.
       It is not enough for him to say, “I did it in self-defense,” whereupon the prosecution must establish the negative.
       The proofs of the accused are not required to establish self-defense by preponderance of the evidence.
       The evidence adduced, however, must be sufficient to require the consideration of a reasonable doubt as to the justification for the homicide.
       To that extent there is a burden of proof on the defendant. De Groot v. United States, 78 F.2d 244, 5 Alaska Fed. 785 (9th Cir. Alaska 1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Distinction between burden on prosecution and burden upon defendant. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Logically there is a possible distinction between the burden on the prosecution to prove the absence of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt and the burden upon the defendant to prove affirmatively enough to create a reasonable doubt that he so acted.
       The burdens seem different if any value to the accused is to be given to the word “beyond” in the historic phrase “beyond a reasonable doubt.”
       Proof beyond a reasonable doubt suggests something less than such a doubt; that the jury’s minds must travel a less distance from the presumed innocence of the accused. It suggests that something more may be required of the defendant to bring the minds of the jury to the full possession of a reasonable doubt than into the lesser area of belief beyond a reasonable doubt; an area between that beyond reasonable doubt and affirmative belief in the defendant’s innocence. De Groot v. United States, 78 F.2d 244, 5 Alaska Fed. 785 (9th Cir. Alaska 1935).

        Improper argument. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a second-degree murder case, the prosecutor repeatedly told the jurors that defendant's claim of self-defense would be valid only if the jurors concluded that the deceased deserved to die; this error was so obvious, and so egregious, that the trial judge was required to intervene - even if defendant's attorney had never objected. Rossiter v. State, 404 P.3d 223 (Alaska Ct. App. 2017).

        Tests for self-defense instruction. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Before a self-defense instruction will be required, two evidentiary tests must be met.
       First there must be some evidence that excessive force was used to effect an arrest or stop the commission of a felony.
       Second, there must be some evidence from which a jury could conclude that the dangerous situation created by the felony no longer existed. Gray v. State, 463 P.2d 897 (Alaska), limited, Wilson v. State, 473 P.2d 633 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       A self-defense instruction must be given if there is evidence from which a reasonable juror could entertain a reasonable doubt as to the defendant’s guilt. Weston v. State, 682 P.2d 1119 (Alaska 1984).

       In prosecution for first-degree assault while it was only defendant’s own testimony which supported his theory that he entered the party house in a non-aggressive manner with the sole intention of conversing with the victim, there was some evidence that defendant did not provoke a dispute with victim under circumstances that he knew or should have known would result in mortal combat, and therefore defendant was entitled to have his self-defense claim, weak as it may have been, properly determined by the jury. Brown v. State, 698 P.2d 671 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for third-degree assault, defendant was not required to show that a robbery was actually imminent, but merely that he reasonably believed one to be imminent, and, having presented some evidence supporting all necessary elements of his claim of self-defense, it was error to refuse to instruct the jury on such claim and to preclude him from presenting evidence to support the claim.

       A specific instruction, based upon the choice of a few of the facts in evidence, but omitting the paramount facts as to the state of the defendant’s mind, emotions, and inferable impulses is final in its declaration as to the absence of self-defense in the case, and the error in such a specific instruction is not cured by later general statements concerning the right of the jury to take into consideration the deceased victim’s threats.

      <p>
       Where a defendant who was a long-time hotel resident used deadly force against the hotel desk clerk in the hotel office, the trial court did not err in rejecting the defendant’s proposed instruction that there is no duty to retreat before using deadly force if a person is attacked on premises which are leased or rented to him and he is not the initial aggressor.

        Refusal to instruct held error. —

      <p>
       Refusal to grant defendant’s request for a jury instruction on the issue of self-defense was error where defendant satisfied the burden of producing “some evidence” that he had acted in self-defense.
       Paul v. State, 655 P.2d 772 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to instruct on self-defense was not harmless although the jury had rejected the affirmative defense of imperfect self-defense, since the burden of establishing imperfect self-defense rests on the defendant, and the standard of proof is a preponderance of the evidence, while the burden of disproving self-defense rests on the state and the standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt.

        Proper instruction. —

      </p>
      <p>
       An instruction was proper which expressly authorized the jury to acquit the defendant if they found that it appeared to his apprehension that he was actually in danger, and which authorized the jury to consider apparent actual danger, and the court immediately thereafter properly charged the jury on the subject of the appearance of danger to the defendant. Ball v. United States, 147 F. 32, 2 Alaska Fed. 536 (9th Cir. Alaska 1906).
      </p>

       The trial court did not err in instructing the jury on the matter of self-defense. Nielsen v. State, 623 P.2d 304 (Alaska 1981).

      </p>
      <p>
       There is no ground for instructing the jury that the threats of a man of vicious character are to give any greater right to a defendant to kill in self-defense than would the threats of a virtuous man. Ball v. United States, 147 F. 32, 2 Alaska Fed. 536 (9th Cir. Alaska 1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the trial court gave an incorrect instruction on the law of self-defense, the error did not appreciably affect the jury's verdict because, when a supplemental instruction was read in conjunction with the other jury instructions on self-defense, and in the context of the parties' closing arguments, there was little chance that the jurors were misled. Jones-Nelson v. State, 446 P.3d 797 (Alaska Ct. App. 2019), rev'd, — P.3d — (Alaska 2022).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a trial for first-degree murder, a self-defense instruction was contrary to the statutory requirements because the disputed instruction erroneously suggested that the jury should evaluate the use of deadly force retrospectively to determine whether deadly force was in fact objectively necessary, rather than whether the defendant’s use of deadly force was reasonable under the circumstances known to the defendant at the time. Jones-Nelson v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska June 24, 2022).

       Thus, the defense is composed of an objective element, i.e., a reasonable belief that force is necessary and a subjective element, i.e., an actual belief that force is necessary. David v. State, 698 P.2d 1233 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not entitled to an instruction on defense of a third person (defendant’s eight-month old daughter) under this section because there was no evidence that defendant believed his daughter faced imminent harm or threat of harm. The judge focused on the appropriate question: whether the child would have been justified in throwing the victim down to defend herself, not on whether she was physically capable of doing so. Leu v.

       In prosecution for fourth-degree assault, since there was evidence from which the jury could infer that defendant believed he had to kick his uncle to prevent harm to his daughter, and that this belief was reasonable, he was entitled to an instruction on defense of a third person as justification for his conduct.

       It was not plain error not to instruct a jury on the use of force in defense of a third person, when counsel did not request the instruction, because, despite clear notice of the potential defense, counsel did not request the instruction, so it was reasonable to conclude counsel decided to forego that defense.

      <p>
       In a conviction of reckless endangerment after defendant accosted rafters who capsized during a river tour, a justification defense instruction was not warranted because defendant failed to present any evidence that the rafters’ use of the river was a trespass as the river and the land below the river’s high water mark were freely accessible to the public, and not subject to defendant’s exclusive possession and control.

       In defendant's first-degree murder trial, the trial court did not commit obvious error in failing to give defendant's proposed instruction based on a theory of hot pursuit; by the time defendant again confronted the victim, there had been a substantial break in time, and defendant was not entitled to return to the scene of the robbery and attempt to recover his property through the use of force an hour after the taking was complete.

       When the police responded to a request for a welfare check at defendant’s home, appellant became belligerent; he kicked at two officers, attempted to bite an officer, and continued to scream and swear; the officers’ initial deployments of the taser were objectively reasonable because the officers were faced with an immediate threat of bodily harm from appellant kicking and biting them in a rapidly deteriorating situation in the home. However, when defendant was handcuffed, seated on the floor, and then placed on his stomach, the need for force changed. The superior court erred by failing to consider whether the police department’s policy on taser use or the nature of the officers’ actions provided notice that the force they used may have been excessive under the Fourth Amendment.

       Summary judgment was proper in favor of police officers on excessive force claims. Qualified immunity applied because examining a driver’s hand was not unreasonable, and one of the officers grabbed the driver’s hand to prevent her from reaching into her coat after she failed to comply with his request for identification. Also, the driver produced no evidence that the other officer’s examination of her hand went beyond what he reasonably thought necessary to assess her injury complaint.

       Trial court's denial of defendant's request for a self-defense instruction was error where defendant testified that he suffered impact to his head and did not remember portions of the events that occurred, his denials of using force generally included a qualification, and his testimony that he was severely injured by a safety officer's unprovoked assault, along with the officer's testimony that he shocked defendant with a taser, pepper sprayed him, tackled him, and hit him with a baton, provided circumstantial evidence that defendant actually believed that it was necessary to use force in self-defense.

       Defendant was not entitled to jury instructions on self-defense and justification because the police warned him multiple times that he risked arrest for disorderly conduct; one of the officers eventually told defendant that he was under arrest; defendant resisted being handcuffed, ultimately resulting in the officers taking him to the ground. The video showed that the arresting officers' use of force was directly in response to defendant's own use of force to resist the arrest;
       the police were entitled to use nondeadly force that they reasonably believed was necessary to make an arrest, and a person could not forcefully resist that arrest, even if it was unlawful, unless the police used excessive force.

       Indictment charging parents with interference with official proceedings was properly dismissed, where the parents’ use of force in arranging for children to fly to Arizona in order to prevent them from testifying in a child abuse case was limited to that typical of any parental or custodial relationship. State v. Jones, 750 P.2d 828 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The parental justification defense set forth in paragraph (a)(1) is not defined in terms of the defendant’s knowledge or belief concerning her legal status; the defense is available only to people who are in fact lawful custodians of children and, thus, in a prosecution for interference with official proceedings, the question for the jury was whether defendant was in fact her child’s lawful custodian, not whether she believed herself to be. Cornwall v. State, 915 P.2d 640 (Alaska Ct. App. 1996).

      <p>
       Under the parental justification defense set forth in paragraph (a)(1), the test of whether the defendant’s actions were reasonably necessary and appropriate to promote her child’s welfare was an objective one and, thus, in a prosecution for interference with official proceedings, the question for the jury was not whether defendant subjectively believed her actions to be necessary and appropriate, but whether her actions were in fact reasonably necessary and appropriate.

Endell, 850 F.2d 470 (9th Cir. Alaska 1987), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 926, 109 S. Ct. 309, 102 L. Ed. 2d 328 (U.S. 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 981, 109 S. Ct. 530, 102 L. Ed. 2d 562 (U.S. 1988).

     </h3>
     <p>
      In any prosecution for an offense, it is an affirmative defense that, in order to obtain evidence of the commission of an offense, a public law enforcement official or a person working in cooperation with the official induced the defendant to commit the offense by persuasion or inducement as would be effective to persuade an average person, other than one who is ready and willing, to commit the offense.
      Inducement or persuasion which would induce only a person engaged in an habitual course of unlawful conduct for gain or profit does not constitute entrapment.

       <b>
        Alaska has adopted the “objective” test
       </b>
       for determining whether entrapment has occurred.
       The objective test requires the court to focus upon the conduct of the police.
       The question is whether that conduct falls below an acceptable standard of the fair and honorable administration of justice. McLaughlin v. State, 737 P.2d 1361 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska employs an objective test for entrapment. This means that the court considers the nature of the police activity involved, without reference to the predisposition of the defendant.

       Where defendant was prosecuted in a “damp” community for trading whiskey for a bear gallbladder offered by undercover state trooper, defendant failed to establish the defense of entrapment to felony counts of sale of liquor without a license, as defendant’s belief that the trade would be legal was not objectively reasonable.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's application for post-conviction relief was properly dismissed as he failed to state a prima facie case of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to request pretrial discovery of missing text messages and to seek a proper remedy once it was clear the text messages were not recoverable. The failure was not material because, regardless of whether it was defendant or the confidential informant who first introduced the idea of the gun-for-drugs exchange, it was clear that defendant was a ready and willing participant in the exchange; and there was no reasonable possibility that the missing text messages would have established the defense of entrapment, even assuming that any recovered text messages actually supported defendant's version of events.

      <p>
       In order to prevail on an entrapment defense, the defendant is required to prove that the police employed fundamentally unfair or dishonorable practices calculated to induce someone to commit the crime in question so that he might be arrested and prosecuted for the offense. While the defendant does not need to negate a predisposition to engage in similar conduct, the defendant must show that the dishonorable police practices were a substantial factor in inducing him to commit the charged offenses; that his commission of the offenses was the direct result of inducement by law enforcement officials.

       For driving under the influence (DUI) purposes, the fact that Texas law requires proof of a voluntary act does not mean that Texas law mirrors Alaska law in requiring proof that the defendant “knowingly” operated a motor vehicle. These two legal requirements are distinct. The Alaska statute requires proof of a voluntary act or omission, even when a defendant is charged with a strict liability offense, and even though the Texas law does not require proof of a culpable mental state with respect to the defendant’s operation of the vehicle, the Texas DUI law is sufficiently similar to Alaska’s DUI law on this issue.

       It was error to make defendant waive rights to remain silent and present a defense and submit to psychiatric exams to assert an involuntariness defense because (1) the court did not clearly understand the proposed defense's factual contours without letting defendant make a full offer of proof describing supporting evidence, (2) the facts were not necessarily inconsistent with involuntariness, and (3) the defense was distinct from insanity or diminished capacity.

      <p>
       District court properly found that defendant violated the conditions of his bail release because the district court took appropriate steps to address defendant's concerns by conducting an on-the-record inquiry regarding the nature and extent of the prior association between the prosecutor and the defense attorney's daughter where both attorneys confirmed the limited nature of the prior association and its irrelevance to defendant's case, any error in appointing the Office of Public Advocacy in an investigative capacity was harmless, and the jury would not have been misled by any latent ambiguity in the jury instruction regarding the culpable mental state.

       Defendant was properly convicted of terroristic threatening because the jury was clearly told they had to find that defendant's threat to kill a case worker was false; the trial court's reminder of the culpable mental state of "knowingly" did not undermine the correctness of everything else the judge said in his response to the jury's questions.

       Defendant was properly convicted of coercion because he made his former romantic partner fearful that she, her current boyfriend, or one of her family members, would be hurt if she did not meet defendant at a local convenience store, and while the jury instruction at issue could have been more precisely with respect to the culpable mental states, it did not prevent defendant's attorney from raising or arguing any defenses that he wished to, nor did it prevent the jurors from considering those defenses, the concept of knowing or deliberate action was inherent in the word "demand," defendant openly admitted that his various statements were a "scare tactic," and an element of an offense could be established if a person acted intentionally.

       Intoxication as a defense.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Voluntary intoxication is not a defense to a prosecution for an offense, but evidence that the defendant was intoxicated may be offered whenever it is relevant to negate an element of the offense that requires that the defendant intentionally cause a result.

       Intoxication is not a defense to second-degree murder,

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court's instruction tracking the language of the intoxication defense statute was flawed because the instruction referred only to the fact that voluntary intoxication could negate an element of an offense that required that defendant intentionally cause a result, but the two charges of attempted first-degree sexual assault did not involve actual causation of a result as those charges required the State to prove that defendant intended to cause a result; thus, the jury should have been instructed that voluntary intoxication could negate an element of an offense that required that defendant intentionally cause or attempt to cause a specified result; however, that flaw was remedied by the summations of the parties.

        Reasonable jury could have found that defendant displayed extreme indifference to the value of human life where defendant, after drinking a large number of alcoholic beverages at home and at a club, decided to drive himself and a passenger home; defendant was extremely intoxicated when he drove his car directly in front of an oncoming car on a well-lit, icy street; evidence of defendant’s prior convictions for drunk driving, and the related treatments required, showed that he had a heightened awareness that driving while grossly intoxicated was dangerous.

       <p>
        Trial judge erred in having defendant take the stand and testify, as defendant was having obvious difficulty in understanding the law and deciding whether to testify; while this was constitutional error, it was harmless, as the defense conceded that defendant, a convicted felon, shot his mother, which supported his weapons misconduct conviction, plus he acted at least recklessly when he shot his mother, and there was no reasonable possibility that the jury would have reached a different verdict on the first-degree assault charge. Alvarez-Perdomo v. State, 425 P.3d 221 (Alaska Ct. App. 2018), rev'd, 454 P.3d 998 (Alaska 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury instructions in defendant's trial for attempted second degree sexual assault were not flawed because they instructed the jury that the State of Alaska had to prove that defendant recklessly disregarded the victim's lack of consent, rather than instructing the jury that the State had to prove that defendant acted without regard to the victim's lack of consent, because the use of the word "recklessly" was preferable, as it referred to the statutorily defined culpable mental state that the State was required to prove.

        Trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on heat of passion because the evidence at defendant's trial did not constitute "some evidence" of serious provocation; there was no evidence in the record to support a finding that the victim assaulted her daughter because the origin of the daughter's injuries went unexplained;

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of second-degree murder because a jury could have inferred that when defendant stabbed the victim eight times, and the victim tried to protect himself, defendant had the conscious objective of causing serious injury to the victim.

        Defendant who murdered her three sons was properly found to be guilty but mentally ill, rather than not guilty by reason of insanity, because the trial court found, in a bench trial, that defendant engaged in a deliberate, conscious, and detailed plan to kill her three sons and thus had the required intent.

        It is constitutional for the legislature to specify a single standard of care for criminally negligent homicide, even when the defendant is a young adult under the age of 25, or even a teenager as young as 16; jurors found that defendant acted with criminal negligence precisely because she did not appreciate the substantial and unjustifiable danger to her mother’s life, and defendant was properly held to an adult standard of care when the jury assessed whether she acted with criminal negligence in causing the death of her mother. Waterman v. State, 342 P.3d 1261 (Alaska Ct. App. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Criminal justice standard for negligence is an objective one, based on the perceptions and conduct one would expect of a reasonable person; all people older than 18 had to live up to the standard of care that one would expect a reasonable person to observe, and this principle remains unchanged, even though the age of adult criminal responsibility is now 16 years for the serious felonies specified in the statute. Waterman v. State, 342 P.3d 1261 (Alaska Ct. App. 2015).

        Criminal negligence is different from the extreme indifference to the value of human life required for second-degree murder or the recklessness required for manslaughter, because, unlike the definitions of extreme indifference and recklessness, the definition of criminal negligence has no subjective component.

       </p>
       <p>
        When a defendant is charged with criminally negligent homicide, one of the elements the State must prove is that the defendant failed to perceive a risk of human death that was substantial and unjustifiable — of such a nature and degree that the failure to perceive it constituted a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.

        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for criminally negligent homicide because the jury could have concluded that defendant's actions were a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would have observed in using equipment not suitable for diving—specifically, a compressor not designed to create breathable air, an air hose that was too narrow, the wrong type of oil for the compressor, and a poorly maintained filter—when the victim died from carbon monoxide poisoning while diving with defendant.

        Before a hand may be deemed a “dangerous instrument,” the state must present particularized evidence from which reasonable jurors could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the manner in which the hand was used in the case at issue posed an actual and substantial risk of causing death or serious physical injury, rather than a risk that was merely hypothetical or abstract.

        The use of a dangerous instrument is not necessarily an element of manslaughter, even though it is safe to assume that the vast majority of manslaughter cases will involve the use of an object or implement that falls within the definition of a dangerous instrument.

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of third-degree assault because, given the nature and specificity of the victim’s statements to a state trooper, the jury could reasonably conclude that she was telling the truth when she said defendant choked her and that her later recantation at trial was not credible and because a person’s hands qualified as a dangerous instrument where they were used to impede a victim’s normal breathing or blood circulation by applying pressure to the throat.

        For purposes of the definition of a “dangerous instrument”, an instrument’s capacity for causing death or serious physical injury is not measured in the abstract; rather, the evidence must establish that the instrument was used in a manner that actually created a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury.

        When an assault is committed by hands or fists only, and when no serious physical injury has been inflicted, it is important to apprise the grand jury that such an assault will be considered a felony only when the evidence in the particular case shows that the defendant used his or her hands in a manner that actually created a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to the victim. State v. Waskey, 834 P.2d 1251 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).

        Feet, regardless of how they are shod, are not per se dangerous instruments. Whether a foot constitutes a dangerous weapon when used to kick another person is a fact-specific determination to be gleaned from the circumstances surrounding an assault; the inquiry in each case must center on the manner in which the kick was administered and the victim’s vulnerability to the kick.

        Where assault victim testified that he was struck with “a chunk of metal or something” and an ophthalmologist testified that the victim’s injuries appeared to have been caused by repeated blows from a blunt object and that liquid thrown into victim’s eyes was “high[ly] alkaline,” the grand jury could properly find that both the blunt object and the caustic liquid were “dangerous instruments” within the statutory definition.

       </p>
       <p>
        Jury could properly conclude, under facts of the case, that defendant’s action of kicking victim several times in the head while he was lying helplessly on the ground made his foot a dangerous instrument, and was sufficient evidence to support conviction.

        Where defendant grabbed the victim’s arm and jerked his torso into defendant’s truck, holding him there while he punched the victim in the face with enough force to fracture his facial bones in three places and causing bleeding in two areas around his brain, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that defendant struck the victim with a dangerous instrument sufficient to cause death or serious physical injury.

        The evidence showed that defendant knocked the victim to the ground with his truck, caused her head to hit the pavement, and then drove over her ankles with both axles. This constituted a serious physical injury because victim had severe pain, and was on crutches for a period of two months following the incident. Moreover, the truck was a dangerous instrument because it was capable of causing death or serious physical injury.

        Defendant’s motor vehicle qualified as a dangerous instrument because it was used in a manner that created a real danger of serious physical injury, even though no one suffered serious injury, when, after defendant’s accomplice stole money from a coffee shop and got into defendant’s waiting vehicle, the shop owner and the owner’s child sustained minor injuries when they fell to the ground after holding onto the vehicle for a while as defendant drove away in the vehicle.

        In a case where defendant drove a truck into a four-wheeler that was occupied by five people, one conviction for third-degree assault was not supported by sufficient evidence because a passenger did not testify that he feared being injured. As to the other counts, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that defendant’s truck, as it was used, posed an actual and substantial risk of serious injury to the other people on the four-wheeler.

        Defendant was properly convicted of second-degree assault because, even without a special instruction on the use of hands as a “dangerous instrument,” given the manner in which the case was litigated and argued to the jury, the jury would have understood that it was being asked to decide whether defendant had used his hands in a manner that actually created a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to his wife. Defendant was trained in martial arts, straddled his wife, grabbed her chin with one hand and the back of her head with the other, and forcefully twisted her neck.

        Evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant used his foot as a dangerous instrument because it suggested that defendant kicked the victim in a particularly violent manner.

        In a case in which defendant was convicted of fourth-degree weapons misconduct for possessing metal knuckles, defendant's weapon of metal knuckles with a short blade attached met the statutory definition of metal knuckles because the jury heard testimony from a trooper that the purpose of metal knuckles was to tenderize the body and break bones; and the trooper explained that a weapon like defendant's was used by wearing the knuckles with the knife pointed down so that the wearer could punch a person with the knuckles and then rake the knife across the person.

        State trooper testified that, while he did not actually get a grip on defendant’s arm when he reached to place him in handcuffs, he did get a hold of a little piece of defendant’s jacket or cuff while defendant was running away; the minimal contact which the state proved was not sufficient to constitute “force”. Howard v. State, 101 P.3d 1054 (Alaska Ct. App. 2004).

        There was sufficient evidence that defendant used force when he resisted arrest. There was testimony that defendant pulled two officers who were trying to arrest him 10 to 12 feet into an alley and began to struggle; after one officer applied a vascular restraint and defendant regained consciousness, defendant immediately started fighting and grabbing for the officers’ hands.

        When the officer took defendant to the back of the patrol car to arrest him, defendant pushed himself away from the car so that the officer had to take him to the ground, defendant tried to get up and continued to tense his arms against his back, and it took the help of a passing motorist to get defendant handcuffed and in the patrol car, defendant’s conduct went beyond “mere non-submission to an arrest,” and the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction for resisting arrest by “force”.

        Where a jury was misinstructed regarding the scope of force that a corrections officer could lawfully use against an inmate, and, from the evidence, the jury could have concluded that the inmate actually and reasonably believed that the officer was about to strike him without justification, inmate would have been entitled to use reasonable non-deadly force against the officer in self-defense.

        Evidence was sufficient to uphold defendant’s conviction for first-degree sexual assault because a fair-minded juror could find that fellatio was coerced by the use of force; defendant’s act of grabbing the victim’s jaw was force beyond the bodily impact required for the act of penetration itself, and the victim testified that his actions caught her off guard and made her feel fearful and intimidated.

        Recognizing the fact that sexual activity is often motivated not by an intent to obtain or bestow sexual stimulation, but rather by the defendant’s desire to dominate, exploit, humiliate, or degrade the victim, the legislature has declared that “sexual penetration” and “sexual contact” require proof of nothing more than the prohibited physical contact.

        Fellatio is not, by its nature, a less serious form of sexual misconduct than the other types of sexual penetration listed in subsection (b) of this section.

        Alaska’s sexual assault statutes do not limit “sexual penetration” to the moment of initial penetration, and nothing in the legislative history supports the argument that once a person is sexually penetrated with consent, that consent cannot be withdrawn. McGill v. State, 18 P.3d 77 (Alaska Ct. App. 2001).

        Merger of three first-degree sexual assault convictions under Alaska’s double jeopardy clause was properly denied because defendant clearly stopped the first sexual assault when he began beating the victim, his wife, and when he was interrupted by the children and left the bedroom to put the children to bed. The acts occurring after the children’s interruption involved different types of sexual penetration. Joseph v. State, 293 P.3d 488 (Alaska Ct. App. 2012).

        In a retrial of one count in a sexual assault case, where three other counts involving three different types of penetration related to the same incident had resulted in acquittal, it was error for the judge to provide an inaccurate definition of sexual penetration in order to prevent a conviction based on one of the acquitted counts.

        Neither the credibility of conflicting witnesses nor the plausibility of the defendant’s version is considered in applying the some evidence test. So long as some evidence is presented to support a defense, matters of credibility are properly left for the jury. Howell v. State, 917 P.2d 1202 (Alaska Ct. App. 1996).

        The jury could reasonably have concluded that defendant’s conduct toward the witness constituted a “threat” under this section, and the evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for interference with official proceedings under AS

        Although the trial court erred in defendant's trial for first-degree murder when it refused to allow defendant's attorney to elicit testimony in cross-examination from witnesses about the victim's reputation for violence or prior violent acts until the defense attorney had first presented some evidence of self-defense, the error was rendered harmless later, when the attorney was able to introduce the same evidence through other witnesses. Furthermore, the attorney also chose not to recall and question the witnesses. Jones-Nelson v. State, 446 P.3d 797 (Alaska Ct. App. 2019), rev'd, — P.3d — (Alaska 2022).

        In a violation of conditions of release case, the court properly prohibited defendant from arguing mistake-of-law regarding his belief that he was permitted contact with the victim because of a letter written by the victim consenting to contact; the letter did not supersede the no-contact provision of the conditions of release in his felony case.

        Trial court erred in convicting defendant, upon a jury verdict, of second-degree vehicle theft for taking another person's dirt bike because the trial court misallocated the burden of proof with respect to defendant's necessity defense; the State did not contest that defendant was entitled to a necessity instruction, and, given that the language in the vehicle theft statutes was drawn directly from the criminal mischief statutes, the State had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had no right or reasonable ground to believe that his act of taking the dirt bike was justified. Redding v. State, 451 P.3d 1193 (Alaska Ct. App. 2019).
