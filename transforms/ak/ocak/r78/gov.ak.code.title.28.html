      <p>
       <b>
        A city ordinance, to the extent it is in conflict with the state traffic regulations,
       </b>
       constitutes an exercise of home-rule power expressly prohibited by the legislature. Adkins v. Lester, 530 P.2d 11 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The word “inconsistent”
       </b>
       describes that which reveals lack of uniformity in over-all purpose or design. Cremer v. Anchorage, 575 P.2d 306 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Similarity to Uniform Vehicle Code. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) is similar in substance and purpose to the provisions of § 15-101 of the Uniform Vehicle Code Annotated adopted by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances in 1962. Simpson v. Municipality of Anchorage, 635 P.2d 1197 (Alaska Ct. App. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Standard governing ordinance validity. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the express terms of subsection (a) it is clear that inconsistency is the standard that governs the validity of a local ordinance regulating the operation of a motor vehicle. Simpson v. Municipality of Anchorage, 635 P.2d 1197 (Alaska Ct. App. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Nature of inconsistency. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       When the question of inconsistency between a local ordinance and state law under subsection (a) is raised, the issue is not whether there is a mere discrepancy between the state law and local ordinance; rather, the inquiry must focus on whether any discrepancy in the ordinance impedes or frustrates policy expressed by state law. Simpson v. Municipality of Anchorage, 635 P.2d 1197 (Alaska Ct. App. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Municipal penalties greater than state penalties are permitted. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the legislature has explicitly granted municipalities the power to enact forfeiture ordinances that are inconsistent with the corresponding provisions of state law, municipalities do not violate state law when they exercise this power. McCormick v. Municipality of Anchorage, 999 P.2d 155 (Alaska Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The saving provisions of subsection (b) by their express terms require a twofold showing
       </b>
       to be made before an ordinance inconsistent under subsection (a) can be upheld. First, it is incumbent upon the municipality to demonstrate the existence of a “specific local requirement.”
       Second, the municipality must show that its ordinance was “necessary,” in other words, that the specific local problem could not be addressed in a manner consistent with the provisions of this title. Simpson v. Municipality of Anchorage, 635 P.2d 1197 (Alaska Ct. App. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Posting of state-wide speed limits not required. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although subsection (d) of this section states that a municipality shall erect signs, the effectiveness of the 30 mile per hour limit set by the state in the Alaska Administrative Code is not conditioned upon the posting of signs. Bailey v. Lenord, 625 P.2d 849 (Alaska 1981).

       ; the ordinance did not authorize conduct that the Alaska legislature had forbidden or forbid conduct that the legislature had authorized, it simply made it harder for the municipality to prosecute someone for the same conduct.

      </p>
      <p>
       City code for Juneau, § 72.02.210(b), does not violate subsection (a) because it regulates or prohibits conduct, unnecessary tire-spinning, that is not inconsistent with state traffic law. State v. Hamilton, 216 P.3d 547 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court did not err when it found that there was no significant inconsistency between the municipal and state laws, and defendant was lawfully stopped for driving while his license was suspended. Jenkins v. Municipality of Anchorage, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 11, 2010), (memorandum opinion).

        Home rule ordinance held not inconsistent with former AS 28.15.300(a). —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Home rule ordinance which prohibited driving a motor vehicle while one’s license is suspended or revoked as did former AS 28.15.300(a) but which was not limited to public highways as was former AS 28.15.300(a) was not in conflict with former AS 28.15.300(a) and, therefore, was not invalid. Cremer v. Anchorage, 575 P.2d 306 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       A slight discrepancy between former AS 28.15.300(a) and an ordinance which prohibited the same acts but was not limited to public highways, i.e., the driving of motor vehicles on private property, was not of such a nature that the exercise of municipal power has been directly or indirectly prohibited by legislative action. Cremer v. Anchorage, 575 P.2d 306 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The overall or basic purpose or design of former AS 28.15.300(a) and a home rule ordinance which prohibited the same acts but was not limited to public highways is the same: to prohibit the driving of a motor vehicle while one’s license is suspended or revoked. Cremer v. Anchorage, 575 P.2d 306 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that former AS 28.15.300(a) referred to the license suspension being effected by a “court of competent jurisdiction” did not mean that the ordinance was inconsistent with the statute because it might have encompassed a valid license suspension effected by a state agency rather than by a court. Cremer v. Anchorage, 575 P.2d 306 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Noncompliance with subsection (c) did not illustrate any inconsistency between an ordinance prohibiting the driving of a motor vehicle while one’s license is suspended or revoked and former AS 28.15.300(a). Cremer v. Anchorage, 575 P.2d 306 (Alaska 1978).

       Although a city ordinance set the speed limit on the streets in question at 20 miles per hour, the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that the applicable speed limit was the state-wide limit of 30 miles per hour since the city did not post speed limit signs as required by the Alaska Administrative Code.

       The power of the commissioner of public safety to adopt regulations governing rules of the road has been interpreted as including the regulation of motorcycle construction and safety apparel insofar as such regulations are reasonable and do not violate constitutional rights of the individual.

        Wholesale frontal assault on traffic laws not intended. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Although the supreme court strongly presumes that most traffic regulations do in fact provide standards of reasonable behavior, it is conceivable that in highly unusual cases certain traffic laws may be so obscure, oblique, or irrational that they could not be said as a matter of law to provide such a standard.
       In the event the courts of Alaska are faced with such arbitrary and unreasonable laws, they may provide that violations thereof merely indicate some evidence of negligence or no evidence at all.
       But it should be emphasized that the supreme court does not intend to signify a wholesale frontal assault on Alaska’s wise and comprehensive traffic laws. Ferrell v. Baxter, 484 P.2d 250 (Alaska 1971).

        Certain class of individual to be protected from certain type of harm. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In promulgating traffic laws and regulations the legislature, sometimes expressly but more often by implication, indicates a policy that a certain class of individual be protected from a certain type of harm.
       For example, in the case at bar the regulation requiring drivers to remain within their lanes was at least partly designed to protect oncoming motorists against head-on collisions.
       By enacting the regulation pursuant to statutory authority, the Department of Public Safety has implicitly indicated that no reasonable person would move from his lane before ascertaining it could be done safely. Therefore, before a plaintiff is entitled to an instruction defining the violation as negligence per se, he must first demonstrate that he is among the protected class and, second, that the injury was caused by a harm against which the law was designed to protect. Ferrell v. Baxter, 484 P.2d 250 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Restatement rules adopted. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       By adopting these rules the supreme court provides a basic method of determining extenuating circumstances which will excuse the violation.
       The list is not rigid.
       Comment a to § 288A of the Restatement states:
       “The list of situations in which a violation may be excused is not intended to be exclusive.
       There may be other excuses.”
       The rule will cover most situations.
       Other extenuating circumstances will have to depend upon the facts of each case. Ferrell v. Baxter, 484 P.2d 250 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fear that obscure or antiquated laws may be utilized to trap the unwary should prove groundless under the above rules.
       In the first place the court will be free under SEC 286 to refuse to adopt such a law as the standard of a reasonable man.
       However, the supreme court wishes to caution both bench and bar that it believes most traffic laws in this state do in fact represent reasonable behavioral standards.
       The supreme court does not intend that the inclusion of Section 288B(2) as part of the adopted rules signals a wholesale assault upon Alaska traffic laws.
       The purpose of adoption of that subsection is to provide an alternative in the rare instance in which, for one reason or another, the violated law cannot fairly be said to require reasonable behavior.
       Needless to say, in its review of such challenged laws the supreme court shall cast a strong presumption in favor of the legislative enactment or regulation.
       The supreme court expects the trial courts of this state to do the same. However, in the unlikely event the court does not adopt the statutory command as the standard of reasonable behavior, it may either permit the violation to be introduced as evidence relevant to the negligence issue — or it may exclude it altogether.

      </p>
      <p>
       It is certainly fair to require all drivers, who must be tested on these traffic laws and regulations before they may obtain driver’s licenses, to know and obey the rules of the road. In few areas is the ancient presumption of universal legal knowledge more fairly applied.
       It is both just and accurate to presume that all reasonable drivers know and obey the law, and to hold them civilly as well as criminally responsible for any unexcused violations thereof. Ferrell v. Baxter, 484 P.2d 250 (Alaska 1971).

      </p>
      <p>
       Traffic laws, including statutes, regulations, and local ordinances, serve two purposes in this state.
       First, they provide criminal penalties, often minor, for their violation. Second, they set the standard of a reasonable man and thereby require a finding of negligence in a tort action if the plaintiff can prove that the defendant committed an unexcused violation.

       Assuming causation is shown, if a plaintiff proves that a defendant violated a traffic law prescribing a standard of reasonable behavior, and the defendant produces nothing to the contrary, plaintiff’s case is then sufficiently strong to warrant a judgment in his favor.
       However, if the law is not held to establish a standard of reasonable behavior and its violation is further held merely to constitute evidence of negligence which may, but need not, be considered determinative by the trier of fact, the judge need not render a verdict for the plaintiff.

       If a trial court holds that a statute sets forth the standard of reasonable behavior and admits evidence of its violation, the court still may, in appropriate cases, permit the defendant to introduce evidence that although he did in fact violate the law, its meaning was so obscure or unreasonable that he acted with all due care in attempting to obey it.
       In this case his violation could be excused under § 288A(2)(c) of the Restatement. Ferrell v. Baxter, 484 P.2d 250 (Alaska 1971).

       Unless otherwise specifically provided, all hearings required under this title or regulations adopted under this title shall be conducted by the Department of Public Safety or the Department of Administration, as appropriate, under regulations adopted by the appropriate commissioner governing practice and procedure and consistent with due process of law. Hearings must be informal, and technical rules of evidence do not apply. A person who requests a hearing may retain an attorney. The hearing officer shall be appointed by the appropriate commissioner and may be appointed from the department conducting the hearing. A hearing officer need not be an attorney, but must be impartial and may not have participated in the decision that is under review. The hearing officer does not have to file a full opinion or make formal findings of fact or conclusions of law, but the hearing officer must state the reasons for the determination and indicate the evidence relied upon. The proceedings at the hearing shall be recorded.

An in-person hearing must be held at the office of the Department of Public Safety or of the Department of Administration nearest to the residence of the person involved in the hearing unless the appropriate department and the person agree that the hearing is to be held elsewhere. The appropriate department shall grant a hearing delay if the person presents good cause for the delay. If a person fails to attend or appear for the hearing at the time and place stated by the appropriate department and if a hearing delay has not been granted, the person’s failure to attend or appear is considered a waiver of the hearing and the appropriate department may take appropriate action with respect to the person.

The judicial review shall be on the record. The court may reverse the determination of the Department of Public Safety or of the Department of Administration if the court finds that the department making the determination misinterpreted the law, acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, or made a determination unsupported by the evidence in the record. The respective department’s decision suspending, revoking, canceling, limiting, restricting, or denying a license, registration, title, permit, or privilege is stayed and does not take effect during the pendency of an appeal.

      When the vehicle identification number required to be registered under this chapter has been altered, removed, or defaced, or is not on the vehicle, the owner shall, immediately upon discovery, apply to the department for replacement of the identification number and for a new registration.
      The department shall search all available sources to determine the identification number originally assigned and, if the number is determined, shall replace it. If efforts to determine the original identification number fail, the owner shall furnish information to show that the owner is entitled to ownership of the vehicle and have it inspected by the department. The department, when satisfied as to the ownership of the vehicle, shall assign an identification number to the vehicle and have the number placed upon the vehicle to which it is assigned. The vehicle shall then be registered under the replaced or assigned identification number.

       Ordinarily oral evidence of a party that he owns property, or proof of possession, when not rebutted, is sufficient to establish the requisite ownership to maintain an action for property damage.

       A person engaged in the business of towing motor vehicles, who tows, transports, or stores a motor vehicle, has a possessory lien on the vehicle.  This lien attaches when the person acts under a contract with the owner or at the direction of a public officer acting lawfully or a person entitled to possession of the property upon which the motor vehicle is parked without consent. The lien remains in effect while the motor vehicle is in the possession of the person, and the vehicle may be sold, as provided in (c) of this section, to pay the charges for towing, transportation or storage.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c10a08s28.10.502ol1b">
       A lien under this section is limited to towing and storage charges and associated mailing fees. Unless a vehicle has already been reclaimed by the owner, the person possessing the vehicle under this section shall notify the registered owner and primary lienholder, if any, of the towing, transporting, or storage of the vehicle, by certified letter, return receipt requested, mailed to the registered owner and primary lienholder, if any, within seven working days after the initial towing, transporting, or storage of the vehicle. The letter shall be sent to the addresses of record of the registered owner and primary lienholder, if any, on file with the department or the corresponding office in another jurisdiction in which the title to the motor vehicle and the lien on it are recorded. Storage charges cease to be part of the lien after 60 days unless the registered owner or primary lienholder, if any, has been given actual notice of the possessory lien within that time or unless the certified letter has been mailed within the time required in this subsection.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c10a08s28.10.502ol1c">
       If the motor vehicle remains unclaimed for a period of 30 days in the possession of the person who performed the towing, transportation or storage, it shall be sold on giving 20 days notice of the sale. The notice shall be delivered to the proper officer and personally served on the registered owner and all lienholders, if any, of the motor vehicle in the same manner as provided by law for service of summons.  If either of these persons cannot be located and served personally, notice of the sale shall be forwarded to the registered owner and all lienholders, if any, at their last known address by certified mail, return receipt requested.  This notice must contain a description of the motor vehicle, including its registration plate number and vehicle identification number, together with the time and place of sale, a statement of the amount due, and the name and address of the person to whom the charges are due.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c10a08s28.10.502ol1d">
       The money realized from a sale made under this section shall be applied first to the payment of costs and expenses of the sale and secondly to the lawful charges of the person having a lien on the motor vehicle under this section. Remaining proceeds from the sale shall be retained by the department to be distributed to the registered and legal owner or lienholder entitled to the remaining proceeds. A purchaser in good faith of a titled motor vehicle sold under this section takes the motor vehicle free of any rights of prior lien.

       The provisions of subsection (a) constitute a broad statement of the legislature’s intent, in enacting the motor vehicle code, to adopt a statutory scheme that deals with the licensing of Alaska drivers in a comprehensive and uniform manner; this subsection is not a legislative commitment to the philosophical concept of an innate privilege to drive.

       The privilege against self-incrimination does not extend to the requirement that motorists produce a driver’s license, despite speeding defendant’s assertion that requiring him to present his license when he was stopped violated his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination because it identified him for the purpose of prosecution.

      <p>
       When defendant’s vehicle was stuck in a ditch and another motorist stopped to pull defendant’s vehicle out and was blocking the roadway, it was reasonable for a trooper to conclude that he should remain on the scene to alert other drivers to the possible hazard and to contact a tow truck. The stop was a valid community caretaker stop, and the trooper was authorized to request defendant’s driver’s license; by calling dispatch to check on the status of the license, the trooper did not unreasonably expand the scope or duration of the stop.

      Most, but not all, information pertaining to motor vehicle accidents contained in Department of Transportation and Public Facilities files or the computer data base is public information and should be released upon request.
      However, certain information regarding particular accidents, including individual names and specific driver’s license information, must remain confidential by operation of statute. March 30, 1988, Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although this section does not explicitly authorize any disclosure of traffic accident reports, these statutorily-required reports have historically been released upon request to those who were either involved in the accident or whose property was involved in the accident, or to their authorized agent, such as their attorney or insurance company. Other than these limited disclosures, however, these accident reports should not be released unless the requesting party has obtained a court order compelling production of the report. Nov. 25, 1994, Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      A “second” photograph taken when a person obtains or renews a driver’s is a part of the license application and is thus a “confidential and private” record under this section.
      As such, it may not be released to the public or to the press except in those circumstances in which it is apparent that the person would authorize the release if the person could be asked, such as when a person is kidnapped or missing, when publication of the photograph may facilitate the subject’s safe recovery. The photograph may also be used for photo line-ups by law enforcement agencies within the state. Nov. 25, 1994, Op. Att’y Gen.

      <p>
       When viewed in context, the phrase “a motor vehicle for which a driver’s license is required” refers to a type of motor vehicle, rather than to the vehicle’s location. Caulkins v. State, Dep't of Pub. Safety, 743 P.2d 366 (Alaska 1987).

       Where a driver was arrested for drunk driving, and the criminal charges were dropped because the arresting officer was deployed to Iraq and would not be available to testify at trial for more than a year, but where the administrative proceedings for the suspension/revocation of the driver’s operating license were not dismissed, the driver’s due process rights were not violated by suspension of her license for almost three years after her arrest because administrative delay alone, without prejudice, did not violate due process, and any prejudice to the driver was slight because she was issued a permit that allowed her to drive throughout the delay. Alvarez v. State, 249 P.3d 286 (Alaska 2011).

       Although the statutory requirement that a police officer inform an individual of the consequences of refusing to submit to a chemical sobriety test is equivalent to the scienter requirement of a criminal statute, license revocation was held not to be criminal in nature in light of the fact that the legislature gave the statute a “civil” label and provided for administrative review, that license revocation does not involve an affirmative disability or restraint, that it has not historically been regarded as punishment, and that a 90-day revocation is not excessive in relation to the remedial goal of obtaining reliable evidence of intoxication and in service of the overall goal of protecting the public from intoxicated drivers.

       Defendant’s driver’s license was properly revoked for refusing to take a breath test where the determination of revocation did not hinge on whether he was actually intoxicated, but rather, on whether his conduct constituted a refusal. Snyder v. Alaska, Dep't of Public Safety, Div. of Motor Vehicles, 31 P.3d 770 (Alaska 2001).

       A towed snowmobile is a motor vehicle because steering such a vehicle, even if only partially, involves exercising control over the vehicle, and it amounts to operating the vehicle; where a motorist was operating a towed snowmobile while intoxicated, and refused to submit to a chemical breath test under the implied consent law, his driver’s license was properly revoked.

       A chemical test reading or result which may be reduced below the level of .10 grams per 210 liters of the person’s breath by applying the margin of error inherent in the particular test used cannot serve as the basis for a license revocation under subsection (c).

       Officer’s testimony concerning defendant’s appearance and behavior did not provide support for license revocation pursuant to subsection (c) as extrinsic evidence to overcome the margin of error inherent in the test result. Haynes v. State, Dep't of Pub. Safety, 865 P.2d 753 (Alaska 1993).

        Admission of suppressed test results held improper. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Because no breath sample was preserved and no second test was given to the defendant, the hearing officer’s decision to admit breathalyzer test results which had been suppressed on due process grounds in a criminal prosecution was improper in a subsequent license revocation hearing.

       The superior court had jurisdiction to consider the validity of defendant’s prior DWI conviction in Wyoming since, if it had been truly entered in violation of driver’s fundamental rights, it would be manifestly unjust to allow that conviction to be used to enhance the license revocation.

       Administrative license revocation is a “remedial” sanction, not a “punitive” sanction, for purpose of double jeopardy; therefore, the administrative revocation of defendants’ licenses was no impediment to their later prosecution for driving while intoxicated, refusing the breath test, or both. State v. Zerkel, 900 P.2d 744 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995), limited, State v. Esmailka, 961 P.2d 432 (Alaska Ct. App. 1998).

        Due process considerations. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the same procedural safeguards apply in civil driver’s license revocation proceedings for driving while intoxicated as apply in criminal prosecutions for that offense, due process requires consideration of the margin of error inherent in the breath testing procedure used. Barcott v. State, Dep't of Pub. Safety, 741 P.2d 226 (Alaska 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Due process requires that an arrestee who fails the breath test must be afforded the opportunity at an administrative revocation hearing to present evidence that he was not driving in order to make that hearing meaningful and fundamentally fair. Javed v. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 921 P.2d 620 (Alaska 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the importance of the driving privilege, the greater potential for effective communication in an in-person context, the need for effective communication where the credibility of a party is at issue, and the limited nature of the prejudice that the state would suffer by providing in-person hearings in such cases, such hearings should be provided where requested by the party. Whitesides v. Dep't of Pub. Safety, DMV, 20 P.3d 1130 (Alaska), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 888, 122 S. Ct. 200, 151 L. Ed. 2d 142 (U.S. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Application of the exclusionary rule would hamper legitimate efforts to keep drunk drivers off the roads and complicate the administration of license revocations while adding minimal deterrence to unlawful police action; in addition, consideration of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment did not undermine the procedural fairness of revocation hearings such that the exclusionary rule was inapplicable to license revocation hearings. Nevers v. State, 123 P.3d 958 (Alaska 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a driver was arrested for drunk driving, and the criminal charges were dropped because the arresting officer was deployed to Iraq and would not be available to testify at trial for more than a year, but where the administrative proceedings for the suspension/revocation of the driver’s operating license were not dismissed, the driver’s due process rights were not violated by the suspension of her license for almost three years after her arrest because administrative delay alone, without prejudice, did not violate due process, and any prejudice to the driver was slight because she was issued a permit that allowed her to drive throughout the delay. Alvarez v. State, 249 P.3d 286 (Alaska 2011).

        The state’s failure to preserve a videotape of field sobriety tests

       taken one hour after arrest violates the due process rights of an accused at an administrative license revocation hearing where the accused is entitled to challenge whether the arresting officer had reasonable grounds at the time of arrest to believe that the suspect was driving while intoxicated. Thorne v. Department of Pub. Safety, 774 P.2d 1326 (Alaska 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The state’s failure to preserve a videotape of field sobriety tests taken one hour after arrest did not violate defendant’s right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him, where the officer who conducted the tests appeared at defendant’s license revocation review hearing and was subjected to vigorous cross-examination by defendant’s attorney.

        Collateral estoppel effect of ruling in criminal proceedings. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant in criminal driving while intoxicated proceedings did not testify at a suppression hearing on the question of the legality of the stop, the suppression ruling that the officer’s stop was legal should have had no collateral estoppel effect against the defendant in a civil driver’s license revocation proceeding. The hearing officer was correct to examine the stop issue de novo, and the superior court incorrectly invoked collateral estoppel in refusing to review this aspect of the hearing officer’s decision. Miller v. State, Dep't of Pub. Safety, 761 P.2d 117 (Alaska 1988).

        Effect of inconsistent blood and breath tests. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Breath test result revealing licensee’s alcohol concentration to be .089 was not rendered invalid by subsequent blood test that revealed the alcohol concentration to be .070 because the discrepancy could have resulted simply from lapse of time; breath test alone was sufficient to revoke licensee’s driver license because a hearing officer could determine that licensee had been intoxicated while driving by relying upon either the breath test or blood test. Morris v. State, 186 P.3d 575 (Alaska 2008).

       <b>
        Effect of absence of witness. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not required that a police officer be prohibited from testifying because he failed to appear telephonically at a previously scheduled hearing. The decision to hold a witness in contempt is in the hearing officer’s discretion, and the driver also failed to ask that the police officer be subjected to forfeiture or damages for failing to appear.

      <p>
       Driver’s license revocation hearing officer erred by failing to inform the driver, who was proceeding pro se, of the correct procedures for obtaining the central piece of evidence in the case, a tape recording of the stop and arrest, and therefore the driver was entitled to a new hearing.

       , one cannot rely on the provisions of this section as an independent source of authority for issuance of limited licenses. By its own terms, subsection (a) of this section does not apply where a statutory provision specifically prohibits issuance of limited licenses. Uhde v. State, 654 P.2d 1323 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).

       This section affirmatively vests the courts with ongoing power to issue a limited license, provided that issuance of such license is not prohibited under a provision of law in effect when the limited license is requested. Howell v. State, 834 P.2d 1254 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).

       Although former provisions specifically authorized the issuance of a limited license to a driver whose license was revoked for DWI/refusal convictions, nothing in subsection (a) restricted the issuance of limited licenses only to such drivers.

       Sentencing panel’s decision denying defendant’s request to grant him a limited license so he could drive for work-related purposes was vacated; decision to grant a limited license would not have constituted a modification of defendant’s sentence for manslaughter.

       Where defendant, whose driver’s license had been revoked, moved for the issuance of a limited license in reliance on newly amended language in this section, and did so within the time limitations of R. Crim. P. 35(a), it was error for the trial court to rule the issuance of such license was precluded by AS 01.10.101 (relating to effect of repeals or amendments) because defendant had been sentenced prior to the amended provision’s effective date.
       Application of this provision prior to the effective date of the amendment was not a retroactive application of an amendment to the sentencing scheme promulgated under AS

       By requiring that permission to drive be knowingly given by a person in control of a motor vehicle, subsection (b) uses the verb “permit” in its narrow sense; therefore, a jury could not have found a violation of subsection (b) in a wrongful death action if it determined that a driver only surrendered a vehicle to an unlicensed person by ceasing resistance and acquiescing to the person’s demand to drive after recognizing that the driver had no ability to control the unlicensed person’s conduct.

       Trial court did not err in denying a motion for summary judgment filed by a representative and an estate on the issue of permission in a wrongful death action after treating the issue as disputed under Alaska R. Civ. P. 15(b) because the driver’s statement regarding permission was not a judicial admission; it was susceptible of more than one meaning, only one of which would have established a violation of subsection (b).

      <p>
       By prescribing a one-year period of revocation upon conviction of driving while his license was revoked (DWLR), and by expressly requiring that period to be added to the period already in existence at the time of the offense, this section makes clear the legislature’s intent to treat the added period as an extension of original revocation. In effect, then, the additional period of revocation relates back to the original revocation as long as the original revocation will be valid, even if, when it is ordered, the defendant technically no longer has a license to revoke.

       Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s conviction for driving while defendant’s license was revoked because defendant’s arguments to the contrary required construing the evidence in the light most favorable to defendant, which was not the standard for reviewing sufficiency of the evidence.

      <p>
       In a case involving driving while license revoked, there was no error in refusing to instruct the jurors on the defense of necessity because there was not evidence sufficient to warrant a conclusion by a reasonable fact-finder that defendant had no reasonable alternative except to drive a vehicle herself after her husband became sleepy; parking the vehicle off of the road for 15 to 30 minutes was a reasonable, adequate alternative to breaking the law. Defendant never suggested that she thought or feared that it would have taken longer for her husband to be sufficiently rested to resume driving. Montgomery v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Dec. 23, 2015) (memorandum decision).

       Even if the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the modified “operating a motor vehicle” pattern instruction, the error was harmless because the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was driving, as it convicted defendant of both driving while under the influence and driving while his license was canceled, suspended, or revoked. To convict defendant of the second crime the jury needed to unanimously find that defendant was driving the vehicle.

       Defendant’s lengthy misdemeanor record and the circumstances of his reckless endangerment conviction, particularly the near miss of a pedestrian, justified the imposition of a maximum term for driving while his license was suspended and a consecutive three-month unsuspended term for reckless endangerment.

       The fact that a defendant’s license had been suspended for driving while intoxicated did not have probative value in evaluating the defendant’s conduct at the time of arrest for violating this section; the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting the evidence of two prior convictions for driving while intoxicated because the jury might have been prejudiced.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature is concerned over the rising toll of motor vehicle accidents and the suffering and loss inflicted by them.
      The legislature determines that it is a matter of grave concern that motorists be financially responsible for their negligent acts so that innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents may be recompensed for the injury and financial loss inflicted upon them.
      The legislature finds and declares that the public interest can best be served by the requirements that the operator of a motor vehicle involved in an accident respond for damages and show proof of financial ability to respond for damages in future accidents as a prerequisite to the person’s exercise of the privilege of operating a motor vehicle in the state.

        Relation to Mandatory Automobile Insurance Act. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act and the Mandatory Automobile Insurance Act coexist as components of the Alaska Uniform Vehicle Code and the latter supplements, but does not supplant, the former. Progressive Ins. Co. v. Simmons, 953 P.2d 510 (Alaska 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The language of AS 21.89.020(c), pertaining to uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, means that all policies in the state must conform to the content requirements of the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, and that if the content requirements of the Mandatory Automobile Insurance Act are broader than those of the former, those requirements must also be complied with as to persons covered by the latter. Progressive Ins. Co. v. Simmons, 953 P.2d 510 (Alaska 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The internal structure of the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act
       </b>
       was examined in considerable detail in Hart v. National Indem. Co., 422 P.2d 1015 (Alaska 1967); Paulson v. National Indem. Co., 498 P.2d 731 (Alaska 1972).

        Due process. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Motorcyclist was not entitled to criminal due process for suspension of his driver’s license for failure to carry insurance. While the license is a property interest, the failure to carry the required insurance is directly related to unfitness to drive, and suspension is a remedial action. Titus v. State, 305 P.3d 1271 (Alaska 2013).

       Security, i.e., the furnishing of collateral of one type or another to cover liability of the person secured for damages in the accident which brought the law into play, is retrospective in operation.
       Proof of financial responsibility is prospective in operation and refers to evidence of ability to meet possible judgments arising out of the future ownership, maintenance, or operation of motor vehicles. Hart v. National Indem. Co., 422 P.2d 1015 (Alaska 1967).

       Until a driver or owner has an accident, a person can own and operate a motor vehicle without having first obtained liability insurance.
       It is only after an accident has occurred that the provisions pertaining to deposit of security and proof of financial responsibility for the future come into play. Hart v. National Indem. Co., 422 P.2d 1015 (Alaska 1967).

        Triggering mechanism. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Under former paragraph (h)(1), UIM coverage is triggered if the tortfeasor’s liability policy limits are less than the claimant’s UIM policy limits; coverage is not dependent upon a comparison between the settlement amount and UIM policy limits. Colonial Ins. Co. v. Tumbleson, 889 F. Supp. 1136 (D. Alaska 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Proper application of former paragraph (h)(1) denied the triggering

       of underinsured motorist coverage where insureds received more under the larger tortfeasor policy than they would have under the underinsured policy alone. Colonial Ins. Co. v. Tumbleson, 873 F. Supp. 310 (D. Alaska 1995).

       <b>
        Meaning of “an insured” in former paragraph (h)(2). —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the phrase “reduced by payments to persons other than an insured” in former paragraph (h)(2), the term “an insured” means any person insured under the policy; thus, if a tortfeasor’s policy is reduced to the point that the available limit is less than the UIM limit then UIM coverage is triggered. Colonial Ins. Co. v. Tumbleson, 889 F. Supp. 1136 (D. Alaska 1995).

       <b>
        Former paragraph (h)(2) exception inapplicable. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the tortfeasor was insured with liability limits at $100,000/$300,000, and the insurance company paid $300,000 to the plaintiffs, who were insureds, the former paragraph (h)(2) exception was inapplicable and did not trigger underinsured coverage. Colonial Ins. Co. v. Tumbleson, 873 F. Supp. 310 (D. Alaska 1995).

       <b>
        Arbitration. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the arbitration panels had no authority to determine anything beyond the insureds' damages arising from their accidents, and because the insurer withheld its consent for the panels to determine anything else, the superior court erred in affirming the final arbitration awards; the arbitration clause was not an expansive provision covering any and all claims arising out of or related to the insurer's insurance policy or even the uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Harbour, 491 P.3d 374 (Alaska 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arbitration panels exceeded their authority by purporting to determine the total benefit amounts an insurer owed the insureds under their coverages since the panels had authority to determine only each insured's damages arising from the at-fault driver's conduct; only a court, not an arbitration panel, could determine whether the insureds were entitled to prejudgment interest on the insurer's liability to the insureds, attorney's fees, and pro rata attorney's fees for subrogated claims. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Harbour, 491 P.3d 374 (Alaska 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to independently adopt the arbitration panels' mistaken legal conclusions that the insureds' settlements with the at-fault parties' insurers provided common fund benefits requiring the insurer to pay a pro rata share of the insureds' attorney's fees and costs incurred in obtaining the settlements because the insureds' policy limits settlements did not directly benefit the insurer and thus did not constitute common fund benefits.

      <p>
       In a personal injury suit filed against the lienholder of an underinsured vehicle, a passenger based his claim as a third-party beneficiary on the theory that the owners’ liability insurance policy, had one existed, would have included underinsured motorist coverage unless it was explicitly declined. Summary judgment for the lienholder was proper because there was no written agreement that the lienholder would provide liability insurance, nor was there any insurance policy from which third-party rights could be extrapolated.

When a plan is approved, all the insurance companies shall subscribe to it and participate in it, except a reciprocal insurer formed by and only insuring a group of municipalities or nonprofit utilities under AS 21.75, or a reciprocal insurer formed under AS 21.75 to provide marine insurance. An applicant for an assigned risk policy, a person insured under an assigned risk plan, and an insurance company affected may appeal to the commissioner of commerce, community, and economic development from a ruling or decision of the authority designated to operate the plan. Failure to adopt an assigned risk plan does not relieve any person from responsibility under this chapter.

        Relation to Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act and the Mandatory Automobile Insurance Act coexist as components of the Alaska Uniform Vehicle Code and the latter supplements, but does not supplant, the former. Progressive Ins. Co. v. Simmons, 953 P.2d 510 (Alaska 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The language of AS 21.89.020(c), pertaining to uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, means that all policies in the state must conform to the content requirements of the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, and that if the content requirements of the Mandatory Automobile Insurance Act are broader than those of the former, those requirements must also be complied with as to persons covered by the latter. Progressive Ins. Co. v. Simmons, 953 P.2d 510 (Alaska 1998).

       Because the Alaska Constitution provides that persons cannot be validly convicted of a crime unless they are personally present at their trial and sentencing, or unless they knowingly and voluntarily waive that right, it is all but impossible for a person who has prior convictions for driving while intoxicated (DWI) or refusing a breath test to commit DWI without either recklessly or negligently disregarding those prior convictions; therefore, the state’s felony DWI statute passes constitutional muster even though the government need not prove a culpable mental state with regard to prior convictions. Hoople v. State, 985 P.2d 1004 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is not void for vagueness because of the fact that most people reach their peak alcohol level within one hour after they stop drinking; consequently, the fact that the police had four, instead of two or three, hours in which to obtain a sample would not make it appreciably more difficult for the typical motorist to evaluate whether he has consumed too much alcohol to legally drive. Valentine v. State, 155 P.3d 331 (Alaska Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is not unconstitutionally overbroad for allowing a defendant to be convicted of driving while under the influence even if his alcohol level at the time of driving was below the statutory limit, because driving with a blood alcohol level below the statutory limit is not necessarily lawful conduct. Valentine v. State, 155 P.3d 331 (Alaska Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section did not violate Alaska’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws to defendant motorist, who offered no evidence or argument to refute the legislature’s judgment that a person who drives after consuming enough alcohol to register a .08 blood alcohol level within four hours is a danger to the public; a motorist could not necessarily predict how long it would take him to drive to his destination or, given the many variables influencing how fast alcohol was absorbed, how impaired he would become en route.

       The prohibition on driving while under the “combined influence of intoxicating liquor and another substance” in former subsection (a)(3) was so vague that it failed to proscribe an activity apart from subsection (a)(1), and it could not be given any construction that would correct this failure. Williford v. State, 674 P.2d 1329 (Alaska 1983).

       The meaning of “combined influence” is clear. Williford v. State, 674 P.2d 1329 (Alaska 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The former term “another substance” in former subsection (a)(3) was unconstitutionally vague because a person was given no notice as to what substances, when used in combination with alcohol, were prohibited. Williford v. State, 674 P.2d 1329 (Alaska 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s two prior DWI convictions were charged under the then-existing Anchorage municipal ordinance, which contained a subsection similar to one in this section, former subsection (a)(3), which was later found unconstitutionally vague; defendant argued that his convictions under the similar ordinance language should also be considered void, but the language of the ordinance was sufficiently different to negate this argument.

       For driving under the influence (DUI) purposes, the fact that Texas law requires proof of a voluntary act does not mean that Texas law mirrors Alaska law in requiring proof that the defendant “knowingly” operated a motor vehicle. These two legal requirements are distinct. The Alaska statute requires proof of a voluntary act or omission, even when a defendant is charged with a strict liability offense, and even though the Texas law does not require proof of a culpable mental state with respect to the defendant’s operation of the vehicle, the Texas DUI law is sufficiently similar to Alaska’s DUI law on this issue.

       There is a narrow set of circumstances where a person who unwittingly and non-negligently ingested an intoxicating substance might be convicted of driving under the influence in Texas, but not in Alaska, but this difference between Texas law and Alaska law is not significant enough to make the Texas statute “dissimilar” for purposes of determining one’s status as a repeat offender; thus, the superior court properly considered defendant’s Texas conviction when assessing his status as a third offender.

       In criminal trials where a defendant is charged with driving while intoxicated under a “physical control” theory so that the government does not prove that the defendant drove or operated the motor vehicle, unless there is evidence suggesting that the defendant’s vehicle was not operable and not reasonably capable of being rendered operable, the jury need not be instructed on the operability issue.

      <p>
       Defendant’s convictions for felony driving under the influence and failing to provide immediate notice of an accident were appropriate. When police first questioned the defendant it was subject to a valid investigatory stop where reading of Miranda rights was not required. The nature of the questions did not convert an investigatory stop into a detention that was similar to an arrest; the officer did not arrest defendant or impose any serious restraint until defendant was placed in the patrol car at the conclusion of the interview.

       In a case involving felony driving under the influence, there was no error in the jury instructions given because the State was not required to prove that defendant’s impairment was attributable solely to the ingestion of controlled substances; it did not have to prove that a lack of sleep played no role in defendant’s impairment.

        Different theories in (a)(1) and (a)(2) of showing intoxication. —

      <p>
       This section describes several ways of committing the single offense of driving while intoxicated.
       Because paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) describe merely different theories by which a person may be shown to have driven while intoxicated, it is not necessary that the jury agree unanimously upon the theory by which a defendant violated the statute. Ward v. State, 758 P.2d 87 (Alaska 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not prior provisions of paragraph (a)(2) requires the state to prove only that defendant’s blood alcohol content was .10 percent or more when he was tested, not when he actually drove his car and was involved in the accident, paragraph (a)(1) plainly and unambiguously relates the time of impairment to the time of driving rather than to the time of a subsequent breath test. Because the jury convicted defendant under both statutory theories of driving while intoxicated, and because any error in the instructions as to the prior provisions of (a)(2) would apply only to one of the two alternative theories, it followed that any error was necessarily harmless. Lee v. State, 760 P.2d 1039 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a driving under the influence case, the court properly allowed amendment of the indictment. Defendant was charged with DUI based on blood and breath samples, which were not, in fact, taken. At the beginning of trial the prosecution changed the indictment to a general impairment theory. This change did not impact the defense theories, nor did it reflect a charge not contemplated by the grand jury in issuing the indictment. Lau v. State, 175 P.3d 659 (Alaska Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       It had already been held that the two definitions of driving under the influence, codified in the statute, were simply variant ways of proving the same thing and that juries did not need to be unanimous as to the theory that supported their guilty verdict; defendant had the burden to show that these decisions were erroneous or no longer sound, but he never mentioned either case, and he did not make a showing sufficient for the court to revisit this prior precedent.

      </p>

       Lack of a jury instruction on the defense that defendant’s blood-alcohol level could be attributed to drinking after driving was not plain error; both sides presented the case as a choice between convicting defendant if the jury found defendant drank only before driving or acquitting defendant under that theory if defendant had anything to drink after the car accident.

       Where the officer making the stop for suspected driving while intoxicated had no indication that the “locate” was based on reliable firsthand information and where the state presented no evidence that the dispatcher or some other officer had relevant knowledge that could possibly be imputed to the arresting officer, the stop was not supported by a reasonable suspicion of imminent public danger and denial of defendant’s motion to suppress evidence gathered after the stop was error. Mix v. State, 893 P.2d 1270 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Additional relevant information in addition to the make of the vehicle and its license plate number called to a police dispatcher but not communicated to officers, could be considered in evaluating whether the officers’ stop of a defendant’s vehicle was justified, since an investigative stop made in objective reliance on a police dispatcher’s bulletin is justified if the dispatcher who broadcast the bulletin possessed reasonable suspicion of imminent public danger justifying the stop. State v. Prater, 958 P.2d 1110 (Alaska Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because police stopped defendant after receiving reports that defendant was driving erratically and after having witnessed such driving, and because defendant failed a field sobriety test, the police had probable cause to arrest defendant for driving while intoxicated in violation of this section; because both the investigatory stop and arrest were lawful under Alaska Const. art. I, § 14, the trial court did not err when it denied defendant’s motion to suppress. Bertilson v. State, 64 P.3d 180 (Alaska Ct. App. 2003).

      <p>
       Defendant’s motion to suppress, based on argument that an anonymous phone call to the police station did not provide reasonable suspicion to allow an officer to stop defendant’s car, was properly denied; from the detail of the informant’s description of the vehicle and its location, it was reasonable for the police to infer that the informant had a good view of defendant and was reporting something that he actually and recently saw.

       Although police officer may have had an ulterior motive for stopping defendant for a defective tail light; even under the doctrine of pretext stops and searches, unless defendant presented evidence to show that the ulterior motive prompted the officer to depart from reasonable police practices, suppression was not required.

       In an investigative stop of a party to a reported domestic dispute, predicated on a 911 call, after that party had left the scene, there was insufficient objective basis to believe that the reported argument had led, or would lead, to a crime to justify the stop, and evidence of party’s refusal to submit to a breath test at the time of the stop should have been suppressed.

       In a driving under the influence case, defendant's Sixth Amendment right of confrontation was violated when the district court allowed the State to prove the presence of Clonazepam through hearsay testimony; defendant's counsel should have been allowed to cross-examine the analyst performing the testing regarding the presence and concentration of Clonazepam in defendant's blood. However, a judgment of acquittal was properly denied because the State's case was legally sufficient to show that defendant was impaired, even though one forensic toxicologist should not have been allowed to testify; the State was not required to prove that defendant's impairment was due solely to the Clonazepam.

       Administrative license revocation is a “remedial” sanction, not a “punitive” sanction, for purpose of double jeopardy; therefore, the administrative revocation of defendants’ licenses was no impediment to their later prosecution for driving while intoxicated, refusing the breath test, or both.

       Trial court did not err in independently evaluating the facts and determining, if based upon substantial evidence, that defendant was driving at the time of a fatal accident and could properly take into account the fact that one person died and two others were severely injured as a result of defendant’s conduct, even though defendant had been acquitted on related charges of manslaughter and assault.

       Defendant’s sentence of 11 1/2 years imprisonment was not clearly excessive where, based upon defendant’s prior record and his current convictions, trial judge found that it was necessary to protect the public because defendant was eventually going to kill someone if he was not incarcerated; trial judge’s findings were supported by the record and supported the sentence imposed.

       It was not plain error to sentence defendant without the required substance abuse evaluation, as the judge was aware from presentence reports that defendant had an alcohol problem and had been unsuccessful in prior treatment attempts, and it did not appear that a new evaluation would have led to a more favorable sentence.

       Judge’s comments in defendant’s felony driving under the influence case were read as indicating, consistent with applicable case law, that the consistently minor harm mitigator would apply only in unusual driving under the influence cases; defendant failed to establish both proposed mitigators of minor harm, as he was intoxicated and actively drinking while driving, which endangered both defendant and his passenger.

I, § 7 requires the sentencing court to determine that the defendant was afforded the right to counsel in the prior case; an uncounseled conviction is too unreliable to be depended on for purposes of imposing a sentence of incarceration, whether that sentence is imposed directly or collaterally.

       Trial court erred in imposing double the statutory minimum fine after defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol in a traffic safety corridor because the statute at issue applied to both criminal and non-criminal offenses, the phrase “the fine, or maximum fine” referred to set fines and maximum fines, but not minimum fines, the words “maximum fine” were not a redundancy, the legislature doubled fines in cases in which a judge had no discretion about the amount—those involving set fines—doubled the maximum in cases in which the judge's discretion to increase the fine was bounded by statute, and left alone cases in which the judge's discretion to increase the fine was already unrestricted—those involving minimum fines.

       In a case where defendant was convicted of manslaughter, first-degree assault, and driving under the influence arising from a collision between a snowmobile and a dog sled, a sentence of 19 years, with 15 years to serve, was not clearly mistaken because the trial court carefully considered the relevant sentencing criteria; defendant had prior contact with the juvenile court, had committed another felony after these offenses, and defendant had taken positive steps towards improvement. However, the trial court determined that death and serious injury were foreseeable consequences of operating a snow machine along a public trail at a high rate of speed, and with reduced visibility, while under the influence.

       Under the terms of a plea agreement in which defendant pleaded guilty to felony driving under the influence (DUI), with open sentencing, and defendant received a sentence of five years to serve, although defendant claimed that his sentence was excessive and that the sentencing judge gave insufficient weight to the sentencing goal of rehabilitation, the judge's sentencing decision was reasonable because the judge expressly considered defendant's potential for rehabilitation as she declared that there was little reason to expect a change in his behavior based on his history of similar offenses and his repeated failed efforts at rehabilitation; and she concluded that isolation should be the paramount goal of defendant's sentence.

      <p>
       The portable breath test authorized by this section does not constitute an unreasonable search under the fourth amendment to the United States Constitution.Leslie v. State, 711 P.2d 575 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The imposition of criminal penalties upon a motorist for his peaceful refusal to submit to a breath test does not violate his right to equal protection under the law. Burnett v. Municipality of Anchorage, 634 F. Supp. 1029 (D. Alaska), aff'd, 806 F.2d 1447 (9th Cir. Alaska 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The implied consent statute clearly serves a legitimate state interest. All drivers lawfully stopped are treated equally, and, from the perspective of the fourth and fourteenth amendments, those drivers are treated no differently from other sorts of persons suspected of committing criminal acts. Burnett v. Municipality of Anchorage, 634 F. Supp. 1029 (D. Alaska), aff'd, 806 F.2d 1447 (9th Cir. Alaska 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arrest was not a prerequisite to a valid exigent circumstances warrantless breath test under subsection (g) of this section; subsection (g) satisfied minimal constitutional requirements for warrantless searches when exigent circumstances existed, and because neither lower court reached the issue whether exigent circumstances justified the search, remand was necessary. State v. Blank, — P.3d — (Alaska Feb. 27, 2004), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 90 P.3d 156 (Alaska 2004).

       Subsection (g) of this section, allowing a law enforcement officer with reasonable grounds to believe a person was operating a motor vehicle involved in an accident causing death or serious injury to administer blood or breath alcohol tests based on the person’s implied consent, implicitly contemplates warrantless searches under circumstances that may be inherently exigent and that may consequently render warrantless searches constitutional, and subsection (g) is constitutional in the context of warrantless searches for breath or blood in accident cases involving death or serious physical injury when probable cause to search exists and the search falls within a recognized exception to the warrant requirement; so construed, subsection (g) has the effect of specifying that such tests are authorized under Alaska’s implied consent statute.

      <p>
       In the implied consent statutes, the legislature has gone to great lengths to avoid authorizing the police to take blood alcohol tests forcibly from defendants charged with driving while intoxicated; the legislature has, instead, provided extremely strong incentives to a defendant to take a breath test for blood alcohol by providing criminal penalties. Bass v. Municipality of Anchorage, 692 P.2d 961 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislature understood the distinction between the court’s general authority to issue a search warrant for a chemical test of a person’s breath or blood and the authority of the police to administer a warrantless chemical test as part of a search incident to a driving under the influence arrest.

       It would be fundamentally unfair to allow the State to assert one penalty, on which an arrestee’s decision to refuse a chemical test relies, and then later convict the arrestee of a charge that carries a greater penalty.

       The statutory right to contact and consult with counsel prior to being required to decide whether or not to submit to a breathalyzer test is not an absolute one, which might involve a delay long enough to impair testing results, but rather a limited one of reasonable time and opportunity that can be reconciled with the implied consent statutes. Copelin v. State, 659 P.2d 1206 (Alaska 1983).

       A person suspected of driving while intoxicated had a statutory right to contact an attorney before deciding whether or not to submit to a breathalyzer test if (1) he requested an opportunity to contact an attorney, and (2) granting the request would not involve a delay long enough to impair test results.

      <p>
       While a defendant has a statutory right to contact counsel, where he never requested an opportunity to contact counsel and there was nothing in the record to show that the police affirmatively interfered with any attempt by defendant to obtain counsel, he was not denied right to counsel.

       Once the breathalyzer examination is completed or refused and videotaping finished, the suspect is entitled to the full use of the rights guaranteed by AS

       Where the judge determined, based on the evidence, that the DWI defendant’s statements regarding having somebody present did not relate to a desire to consult with counsel about breathalyzer examinations or field sobriety test, but rather related to having someone present to observe the administration of the test, perhaps a technician, to insure its validity, the judge was not clearly erroneous in concluding that the defendant did not properly invoke his Copelin rights and that the results of the breathalyzer examination should not be suppressed.

       In situations where the police are relying on the implied consent statutory scheme as their authority for subjecting a person to alcohol testing, they are prohibited from administering non-consensual chemical tests to persons who have refused to submit to a breath test except in certain circumstances; but there are no such limitations to the court’s authority to issue search warrants for chemical tests for which probable cause otherwise exists.

       Defendant’s motion to suppress the results of a blood test should have been denied because it improperly interpreted the implied consent law as restricting the court’s authority to issue a search warrant for a chemical test of a person’s blood upon a proper showing of probable cause; the statute authorizes courts to issue search warrants when a motorist refuses to take a breath test for the purpose of establishing the motorist’s blood-alcohol level.

       When a person is arrested for operating a motor vehicle in violation of state or local drunken driving ordinances, and requests to contact an attorney, the arrestee must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to do so before being required to decide whether or not to submit to a breathalyzer test; and where arrestee is denied that opportunity, subsequently obtained evidence, whether in form of test results or of refusal to take test, must be suppressed.

       The statutory right to contact and consult with counsel prior to being required to decide whether or not to submit to a breathalyzer test is not an absolute one, which might involve a delay long enough to impair testing results, but rather a limited one of reasonable time and opportunity that can be reconciled with the implied consent statutes.

       A person suspected of driving while intoxicated had a statutory right to contact an attorney before deciding whether or not to submit to a breathalyzer test if (1) he requested an opportunity to contact an attorney, and (2) granting the request would not involve a delay long enough to impair test results.

       It would be fundamentally unfair to allow the State to assert one penalty, on which an arrestee’s decision to refuse a chemical test relies, and then later convict the arrestee of a charge that carries a greater penalty. Therefore, a due process issue was raised when defendant was convicted of a felony after being erroneously advised, through an out-of-date form, as to the criteria for determining if the refusal constituted a felony rather than a misdemeanor.

      <p>
       When an arrestee initially refuses a breath test but has a change of heart shortly thereafter — while still in the presence of the arresting officer and the breath testing machine — the subsequent consent will be relevant on the issue of whether the initial refusal was unequivocal. To the extent that it is relevant on this issue, evidence of consent is independently admissible and may be relied on by the accused regardless of whether the affirmative defense of subsequent consent has been formally adopted. Lively v. State, 804 P.2d 66 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether a motorist’s subsequent consent to take a breath test cures the prior refusal, the following factors should be considered: that the subsequent consent occurred within a reasonable time after the prior first refusal; that the test administered following the subsequent consent will still be accurate; that the test will not result in any substantial expense or inconvenience to the police; and that the arrestee has been in continuous custody of the arresting officer and under observation for the entire time.

       Even though this section makes the refusal to take the breathalyzer examination admissible, it does not make the refusal admissible without regard to the other evidence rules, and to be admissible, evidence of refusal is required to be relevant, and the probative value of the evidence should not be outweighed by its prejudicial impact.

       Defendant’s refusal to take the breathalyzer test did not give rise to a constitutional claim of privilege since even assuming the breathalyzer refusal could have been deemed to have amounted to a testimonial statement, this statement could not properly have been considered privileged since defendant had no legal right to make it.

      <p>
       By its holding that admission of evidence of defendant’s refusal to take a breathalyzer test did not violate defendant’s constitutional right against self-incrimination, the court did not mean to indicate that evidence of breathalyzer refusals is per se admissible in all cases; as with other types of circumstantial evidence, admissibility of breathalyzer refusals should be determined pursuant to Evidence Rules 401-403, on a case-by-case basis, by weighing probative value against potential for unfair prejudice.

       The approved methods of administering the breathalyzer, established by the Department of Health and Social Services in accord with subsection (d) of this section, are set forth in former 7 AAC 30.020. Completion of the “Breathalyzer Operational Checklist” is the first of 13 procedures established for proper test administration. Completion of the checklist is required under subsection (d) of this section; however, absolute compliance in completing the checklist is not required in order to render the test results valid and admissible in evidence.

        Effect of compliance with “Breathalyzer Operational Checklist”. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The “Breathalyzer Operational Checklist” is a simplified method of establishing the admissibility of the evidence.
       It furnished the court with a clear record that all the substantive test procedures were accomplished, thereby minimizing the possibilities of human error and failed memory. This then warrants the presumption under subsection (d) of this section that the results are valid without any additional showing of foundational facts.
       If the checklist is not complete, the presumption of validity is inapplicable.
       But it does not necessarily follow that the test results are, therefore, automatically inadmissible. Oveson v. Municipality of Anchorage, 574 P.2d 801 (Alaska 1978).

        Where there has been substantial compliance with the “Breathalyzer Operational Checklist” provision of former 7 AAC 30.020,

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the checklist for administering the breathalyzer test was complete but for one checkmark, all other pertinent data were filled in, and there was uncontroverted testimony that the step in question was performed despite the failure to check off the box representing that step, once the trier of fact believed the evidence that the step in question was performed, a proper foundation was laid to find the results valid under subsection (d) of this section. Oveson v. Municipality of Anchorage, 574 P.2d 801 (Alaska 1978).

      <p>
       Although defendant claimed he burped or regurgitated prior to submitting to a breath test and a police officer should have restarted the 15-minute observation period, the trial judge did not err in concluding the prosecution met the foundational requirements for admission of the breath test result. The officer testified that had defendant burped, she would have restarted the observation period, and defendant did not present any evidence that regurgitation occurred during the observation period.

       For due process and search and seizure analysis, a blood test is not viewed as materially more intrusive than a breath test. The search and seizure provisions of the federal and state constitutions are not offended by a statute that allows the police to take a blood sample from an arrested motorist where the motorist has injured or killed another person without seeking a breath sample first. Municipality of Anchorage v. Ray, 854 P.2d 740 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right to privacy granted by Article I, Section 22 of the Alaska Constitution does not create a separate, independent right to seek exclusion of evidence. Subsection (a) does not violate a right to privacy under Article I, Section 22 of the Alaska Constitution.Municipality of Anchorage v. Ray, 854 P.2d 740 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).

       In light of the fact that the legislature has gone to great lengths to avoid authorizing the police to forcibly take blood tests, this section should not be read broadly. Bass v. Municipality of Anchorage, 692 P.2d 961 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984).

       The legislature has eliminated a driver’s ability to refuse a chemical sobriety test when an arrestee is involved in an accident that results in the death of or injury to another person. Pena v. State, 684 P.2d 864 (Alaska 1984).

       This statute authorizes the police to require a motorist to submit to a blood test even though there has been no prior attempt to obtain the motorist’s consent to a breath test. Municipality of Anchorage v. Ray, 854 P.2d 740 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).

        Validity of search warrant issued for chemical testing. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In situations where the police are relying on the implied consent statutory scheme as their authority for subjecting a person to alcohol testing, they are prohibited from administering non-consensual chemical tests to persons who have refused to submit to a breath test except in certain circumstances; but there are no such limitations to the court's authority to issue search warrants for chemical tests for which probable cause otherwise exists. State v. Evans, 378 P.3d 413 (Alaska Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislature understood the distinction between the court's general authority to issue a search warrant for a chemical test of a person's breath or blood and the authority of the police to administer a warrantless chemical test as part of a search incident to a driving under the influence arrest. State v. Evans, 378 P.3d 413 (Alaska Ct. App. 2016).

      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that it was not practical to offer a defendant a breathalyzer test does not bring the case within subsection (b) of this section; what does seem to fall within subsection (b) is a narrow class of cases where the defendant is unconscious or otherwise incapable of manifesting his intent to refuse. Bass v. Municipality of Anchorage, 692 P.2d 961 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature’s choice of language seems to be consistent with the theory that subsection (b) of this section was intended to apply only to situations where a blood-alcohol test could be conducted without any violence such as where an arrestee is unconscious. Bass v. Municipality of Anchorage, 692 P.2d 961 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984).

       Case was remanded for resentencing on convictions of failing to stop, render aid, and contact authorities, where the trial court enhanced a first felony offender’s sentence on the basis of aggravating factors without giving advance notice and the court’s findings included a finding of physical injury, which appeared to be an element of the offenses.

        New statutory offense. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not codify a common-law crime but rather creates a new statutory offense. Kimoktoak v. State, 584 P.2d 25 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        On its face, this section appears constitutionally defective
       </b>
       for its failure to require criminal intent, or more particularly, for its failure to require that a person knowingly failed to render assistance. Kimoktoak v. State, 584 P.2d 25 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       On its face this section does not require that a person have knowledge of the accident or of the fact that injuries have resulted to be guilty of a serious crime.
       Thus the statute appears to hold a person strictly liable for failure to render assistance even if he is unaware of any wrongdoing, i.e., unaware of the circumstances giving rise to the duty and thus unaware that he is in fact failing to do the required act. Kimoktoak v. State, 584 P.2d 25 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        But the requisite intent may be read into the statute by implication.
       </b>
       Kimoktoak v. State, 584 P.2d 25 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature intended that criminal liability under this section attach only where the operator of a motor vehicle knowingly fails to stop and render assistance.
       The statute requires an affirmative course of action to be taken by the driver and it necessarily follows that one must be aware of the facts giving rise to this affirmative duty in order to perform such a duty. Kimoktoak v. State, 584 P.2d 25 (Alaska 1978).

       <b>
        When criminal liability under subsection (c) attaches. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Criminal liability under subsection (c) of this section attaches to a driver who leaves the scene of an accident where the state can prove by direct or circumstantial evidence that the driver actually knew of the injury or that he knew that the accident was of such a nature that one would reasonably anticipate that it resulted in injury to a person. Kimoktoak v. State, 584 P.2d 25 (Alaska 1978).

        “Accident” defined. —

       An “accident” is any incident in which someone suffers injury or death. Wylie v. State, 797 P.2d 651 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Involved in an accident” defined. —

       A vehicle is “involved in an accident” if there is a causal nexus between the vehicle and the injury or death. Wylie v. State, 797 P.2d 651 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        When a passenger jumps from a moving vehicle
       </b>
       and as a result suffers injury or death, the motorist is obligated to stop and render assistance and notify the proper authorities, and this is true whether or not the operator was warned of the passenger’s desire to leave the vehicle. Wylie v. State, 797 P.2d 651 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Intoxication. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where one is charged with failure to render assistance under this section, and where there is evidence of intoxication, the jury may consider the fact that the accused was intoxicated in determining whether he had the requisite knowledge. Kimoktoak v. State, 584 P.2d 25 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in instructing the jurors that they could not consider defendant’s intoxication in deciding whether he acted knowingly with regard to the offenses of failing to remain at the scene of an accident and failing to render assistance to an injured person. Williams v. State, 737 P.2d 360 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).

      <p>
       <b>
        Fault. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Resentencing was necessary following defendant’s guilty plea to failure to render assistance to an injured person after an automobile accident. There was no support in the record for the conclusion that defendant’s speed, driving, attentiveness, or state of sobriety rendered defendant at fault for the accident. Therefore, the appellate court perceived a substantial possibility that the sentencing judge penalized defendant based on an unsupported finding of fault.
       Smith v. State, 369 P.3d 555 (Alaska Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>

       <b>
        No error in manner in which state permitted to argue element of knowledge to jury. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the prosecution never argued that the reasonable person standard could be substituted for actual knowledge that injuries had occurred, defendant’s argument that no reference could be made of the reasonable person standard was without merit. Atchak v. State, 640 P.2d 135 (Alaska Ct. App. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Instruction
       </b>
       that the jury could find knowledge of injury “where the circumstances were such that they would lead a reasonably prudent person to assume that an accident resulting in injury” must have occurred was erroneous, since it is not the reasonable person who is on trial but the defendant and it is the defendant’s knowledge which must be proved and not that of a hypothetical reasonable person. Kimoktoak v. State, 584 P.2d 25 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the trial court’s first instruction on the elements of the offense of failure to render aid adequately apprised the jury of all necessary elements with the exception of the element of knowledge, but two additional instructions specifically addressing the element of knowledge conformed precisely to the requirements of Kimoktoak v. State, 584 P.2d 25 (Alaska 1978), no error was committed by the court in instructing the jury. Atchak v. State, 640 P.2d 135 (Alaska Ct. App. 1981).

        The crime of leaving the scene of an accident is not amenable to civil compromise.
       </b>
       Hensel v. State, 585 P.2d 878 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The act constituting the crime of leaving the scene of an accident is the failure to stop and make the necessary exchanges of information or assistance after the accident has occurred.
       This omission is not one which causes injury to the private citizen within the meaning of the civil compromise statutes. Settlement of the claim for injuries resulting from the accident cannot settle the state’s claim for a violation of its laws. Hensel v. State, 585 P.2d 878 (Alaska 1978).

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that defendant’s sister repeatedly drove while intoxicated, and that she was present in the car at the time of the accident, could not be used to prove that defendant was not the driver. Such evidence is character evidence, barred by Alaska R. Evid. 404(b), and not habit evidence under Alaska R. Evid. 406. Wacker v. State, 171 P.3d 1164 (Alaska Ct. App. 2007).

      <p>
       Sentence imposed for manslaughter, assault in the third degree, and failure to render assistance to an injured person after an accident was not clearly mistaken; the judge’s findings were supported by the record, as defendant was highly intoxicated and yet chose to drive, and in spite of the fact that he knew he struck a person, a boy of thirteen, defendant fled from the scene, leaving the victim to die. Bottcher v. State, 262 P.3d 224 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011), aff'd, 300 P.3d 528 (Alaska 2013).

       Where defendant struck and killed a pedestrian in a rural area at night, and testimony showed the victim may have survived if she had received immediate emergency care, the trial court did not err in finding defendant to be a worst offender and in sentencing him to ten years with five years suspended.

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Among the reasons for refusing evidentiary status to accident reports is their hearsay character; a second consideration is to prevent the jury from being unduly influenced by an official document. These issues are not present when the contents of the report are testified to by the investigator. Thus, only use of the actual report is barred. Adkins v. Lester, 530 P.2d 11 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        This section does not prohibit the oral testimony or expert opinions of an investigator
       </b>
       which are also contained in an automobile accident report. Adkins v. Lester, 530 P.2d 11 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       In view of Alaska’s established rule favoring admission of expert opinion testimony, it would seem wise not to exclude such expert testimony simply because the witness prepared the written report which is barred by the statute. Adkins v. Lester, 530 P.2d 11 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although under this section a written report itself is generally inadmissible, the police officer who investigates the accident may testify to the observations which he made in preparing the report, and his observations would include any statements which were made to him in the course of the investigation that were otherwise admissible, including the statement of a defendant that he was the driver of the vehicle in question.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where a state trooper was permitted to refer to the accident report he had prepared as part of his investigation in order to recreate for the jury a diagram of the scene of the accident, and he was also permitted to read from his report the statement he took from one of the two witnesses to the accident, this testimony was properly admitted.

       This section describes service vehicles as buses, garbage trucks, tow trucks or ambulances, but a reasonable construction of the statute would hold that one who pulled his car over to the side of the road in an emergency situation in order to aid the occupants of an overturned car was acting in a service capacity.

       A person who pulled over to the side of the road in an emergency situation to aid the occupants of an overturned car, apparently parking as far over on the right as he could given the snow conditions and the presence of a ditch on the side of the road, and who also turned his emergency flasher lights on, was entitled to make a brief stop on the roadway as necessary in the performance of Samaritan efforts.

       The crime of felony eluding presents a single crime, with alternative ways to commit it; the four different aggravating circumstances that raise an act of eluding to a felony do not amount to four separate crimes, but rather are four different ways of committing the same crime.
       Taylor v. State, 400 P.3d 130 (Alaska Ct. App. 2017) (memorandum decision).

        Sufficiency of evidence. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of eluding police because it showed that a police officer attempted to make a traffic stop and that defendant, rather than stopping, accelerated and weaved through traffic before making a sharp right turn onto an intersecting street and abandoning his vehicle; while driving in a reckless manner was an element of the eluding charge, the evidence sufficiently established reckless driving where defendant accelerated, changed lanes quickly, darted between adjacent cars, and made a right turn so abruptly that his tires went over the curb in the process.
       Newsom v. State, 199 P.3d 1181 (Alaska Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s conviction for failure to stop at the direction of a peace officer in the first degree, when defendant initially stopped and then drove away, drove recklessly by driving over the speed limit through a residential area, where streets were covered with snow and ice, at times driving in the opposing lane of travel, and driving well over the speed limit on a highway that was icy in some areas, forcing other cars to pull off of the highway to avoid a collision. Williams v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. July 29, 2015) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s convictions were proper because reasonable jurors could have concluded that defendant intentionally steered his vehicle toward the officer, that defendant’s protestations of fear to the 911 operator were not genuine, and that defendant’s driving maneuvers during the police chase amounted to reckless driving, which was the other component of the felony eluding charge. Shorthill v. State, 354 P.3d 1093 (Alaska Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of first-degree failure to stop at the direction of a police officer where he committed the crime of reckless driving while he was eluding the police. Defendant sped away from the police, the roads were icy and snowy at the time, he barely slowed down as he drove through two stop signs, and he had a blood alcohol level of .197 percent (more than twice the legal limit). Lovett v. State (Alaska Ct. App. Jan. 27, 2016) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s conviction for failure to stop at the direction of a peace officer because, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, multiple witnesses identified defendant. Elia v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. June 29, 2016) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was properly convicted of second- and fourth-degree assault, second-degree failure to stop at the direction of a peace officer, and misdemeanor driving under the influence because, while the superior court should have merged his two convictions for second-degree assault, defendant's attack on his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend was unprovoked and left the boyfriend permanently disfigured, defendant failed a sobriety test, and the sentencing judge properly rejected the proposed mitigator where defendant's conduct was within the “heartland” of the definition of the offenses, his prospects for rehabilitation were “guarded,” and he had no remorse.
       Lewis v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 31, 2016) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Jury properly convicted defendant of attempted first-degree murder, third-degree assault, first-degree harming a police dog, and felony failure to stop at the direction of a peace officer because the evidence that defendant shot and killed a police dog, and fired multiple rounds in the direction of the two officers was sufficient to conclude that defendant intended to kill the officers.
       Abarca v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Dec. 9, 2020) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        No fatal variance.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if some of the jurors relied on the fact that defendant had caused an accident when they found him guilty of felony eluding, there was no fatal variance; there was no reason to believe that the grand jurors viewed the collision with the patrol car as separate from the dangerous driving that preceded it, and the fact that defendant purposely backed into the patrol car at the end of the chase was simply a component of the evidence that he drove recklessly.
       Taylor v. State, 400 P.3d 130 (Alaska Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Unanimity regarding theory not required.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s reckless driving and his collision with the patrol car were simply different aspects of one continuing act of eluding, and because his case involved only one act of eluding, the jurors did not need to reach unanimity regarding the theory that made this act of eluding a felony-level offense.
       Taylor v. State, 400 P.3d 130 (Alaska Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>

       <b>
        Exculpatory evidence. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s convictions for felony eluding and third-degree assault were proper because the State did not violate its duty to present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. Related 911 calls were susceptible of conflicting interpretations and were therefore not the kind of evidence that, standing alone, negated defendant’s guilt. Shorthill v. State, 354 P.3d 1093 (Alaska Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Reckless driving as an element of eluding police charge. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a felony eluding case, because the State presented evidence that defendant drove at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour along a winding, hilly two-lane road with limited visibility, at times crossing the center line, reasonable jurors could find that his driving posed a substantial and unjustifiable risk of harm, not only to defendant, but also to the pursuing officer and to the public at large; thus, even if the judge had instructed the jury to disregard any risk to defendant or to his own vehicle when it considered whether he drove recklessly, the jury would have returned the same verdict. Accordingly, any error the judge might have committed regarding the scope of the reckless driving statute was harmless.
       Snider v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Oct. 10, 2018) (memorandum decision).

       When defendant pulled away from the scene of a party, a trooper walked into the road to look at his license plate and waved at defendant; a reasonable person in defendant’s position would not have felt free to leave the scene. Majaev v. State, 223 P.3d 629 (Alaska 2010).

       (7)(F), as interpreted in Sapp v. State, 379 P.3d 1000 (Alaska App. 2016). Therefore, a district court properly denied a motion for judgment of acquittal on a charge of failure to stop for a peace officer because defendant knowingly failed to stop for an agent of the Alaska Railroad's security force; the agent was in active pursuit of defendant for a violation that had just occurred on Alaska Railroad property. Forsythe v. State, 391 P.3d 643 (Alaska Ct. App. 2017).

       Under this section prior to the 1977 amendment, a person might suffer a felony conviction for a simple negligent failure to act.
       To make such an act a serious crime without regard to an awareness of wrongdoing or the intentional infliction of injury is inconsistent with the general law.
       To convict a person of a felony for such an act, without proving criminal intent, is to deprive such person of due process of law. Alex v. State, 484 P.2d 677 (Alaska 1971).

       If one failed to return an automobile out of neglect, without any intention to deprive the owner of his property or to convert property to his own use, or of doing wrong to the owner, he was made guilty of a felony prior to the 1977 amendment of this section although he might have acted unwittingly or inadvertently or negligently.
       This was contrary to the general condition of criminal liability which required not only the doing of an act, but also the existence of a guilty mind during the commission of the act. Alex v. State, 484 P.2d 677 (Alaska 1971).

       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of eluding police because it showed that a police officer attempted to make a traffic stop and that defendant, rather than stopping, accelerated and weaved through traffic before making a sharp right turn onto an intersecting street and abandoning his vehicle; while driving in a reckless manner was an element of the eluding charge, the evidence sufficiently established reckless driving where defendant accelerated, changed lanes quickly, darted between adjacent cars, and made a right turn so abruptly that his tires went over the curb in the process.

       Defendant’s convictions were proper because reasonable jurors could have concluded that defendant intentionally steered his vehicle toward the officer, that defendant’s protestations of fear to the 911 operator were not genuine, and that defendant’s driving maneuvers during the police chase amounted to reckless driving, which was the other component of the felony eluding charge.

       Where defendant was driving a motor vehicle that, without apparent reason, began to swerve back and forth across the highway and finally left the road, these circumstances, if unexplained, were sufficient to support an inference of recklessness.

       Speeding driver crossed the median, hitting another car and injuring its occupants. His blood alcohol level was in excess of .2. The evidence supported convictions for first degree and third degree assault, reckless driving, driving under the influence, and failing to render assistance in an accident where there is an injury.

       District court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress because a state trooper had reasonable suspicion to believe she committed the offense of reckless driving where he observed skid marks on the road, tire gouges in a ditch, a bent newspaper box pole, and a trail of vehicle fluid, the vehicle was found within a mile or two of the accident, a woman collecting items from the vehicle and a station attendant identified defendant as the driver, the woman informed the trooper where defendant could be located, and during that contact, he observed signs that she was intoxicated, which justified shifting the focus of his investigation to the risk that she had been driving under the influence.

       Evidence was legally sufficient to support defendant's convictions for driving under the influence and the lesser-included offense of reckless driving; defendant drove her car into a ditch and abandoned it with the motor running, the trooper who interviewed her smelled alcohol on her, she performed poorly on field sobriety tests, and contrary to her argument, the jury's determination that defendant's excuses were not credible was not second-guessed on appeal.

       Subsection (b) is not a penalty provision dealing specifically with the offense of driving while license suspended; rather it is a generic penalty provision, broadly applicable to violations of all Title 28 provisions for which the specific penalties are given.

      <p>
       The term “law,” as used in subsection (c) of this section, refers to statutory enactments of the Alaska legislature and cannot be read to include the provisions of municipal ordinances. Anderson v. Municipality of Anchorage, 645 P.2d 205 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).

      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement of correspondence stated in subsection (c) of this section calls for a level of similarity between a municipal ordinance and a provision of AS 28 that would make the ordinance a functional equivalent of its statutory counterpart. Anderson v. Municipality of Anchorage, 645 P.2d 205 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).

       <b>
        The legislature’s purpose in enacting subsection (d)
       </b>
       was to eliminate the criminal stigma from minor traffic offenses while keeping the enforcement of such offenses within the criminal system’s procedures. State v. Clayton, 584 P.2d 1111 (Alaska 1978).

       to which certain criminal procedures including the issuance of warrants are applicable. State v. Clayton, 584 P.2d 1111 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the language in subsection (d) with regard to an infraction not being considered a criminal offense nor a fine therefor a criminal punishment indicates that the legislature did not intend to make minor traffic offenses criminal offenses, it does not follow that the legislature by labeling infractions “noncriminal” meant that they are civil in nature and thus that criminal procedures are not available for the enforcement of infractions. State v. Clayton, 584 P.2d 1111 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding the legislative labeling of a traffic infraction a noncriminal offense by this section, it retains many criminal terms, such as “convicted,” “violation,” “guilty,” “punishable by a fine.” State v. Clayton, 584 P.2d 1111 (Alaska 1978).

       AS 28.10.105(a) (now repealed) and the other registration statutes in pari materia do not specify a violation of the registration statutes as an infraction, and thus under this section, such a violation is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days’ imprisonment, and entitling a defendant to a jury trial, denial of which right constitutes prejudicial error requiring a new trial.

       In the absence of express contrary declaration, the legislature did not intend by the enactment of subsection (d) to affect the traditional use of the criminal process for enforcement of traffic infractions. State v. Clayton, 584 P.2d 1111 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section makes no changes in the traditional mode of proceeding in criminal matters with the exception of its declaration that a person cited with an infraction does not have a right to trial by jury or to court-appointed counsel. The action is brought in the name of the state; it is commenced by the filing of a complaint by a law enforcement official; it is prosecuted by the district attorney.
       The exceptions appear to merely codify existing constitutional law. State v. Clayton, 584 P.2d 1111 (Alaska 1978).

       Defendant was charged with DUI in a traffic safety corridor. On conviction, the occurrence in the safety corridor doubles the fine which is imposed in other DUIs. Defendant, who had a prior DUI conviction, rejected an offered plea agreement which included his admission that he was in a safety corridor, stating that he did not want to make that admission. The plea agreement proceeding continued and the defendant pled guilty without being specifically asked if he admitted the safety corridor element, and without being told of his right to a jury trial on that issue. Because defendant never admitted that he was in a safety corridor, nor did he waive his right to a jury trial on the safety corridor issue, the plea agreement was invalid.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s double fine for driving under the influence in a traffic safety corridor was vacated because, inter alia, when the legislature extended double fines to such corridors, the legislature did not change prior legislative intent to limit this penalty to offenses amenable to disposition without court appearance. Fyfe v. State, 334 P.3d 183 (Alaska Ct. App. 2014), aff'd, 370 P.3d 1092 (Alaska 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in imposing double the statutory minimum fine after defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol in a traffic safety corridor because the statute at issue applied to both criminal and non-criminal offenses, the phrase “the fine, or maximum fine” referred to set fines and maximum fines, but not minimum fines, the words “maximum fine” were not a redundancy, the legislature doubled fines in cases in which a judge had no discretion about the amount—those involving set fines—doubled the maximum in cases in which the judge's discretion to increase the fine was bounded by statute, and left alone cases in which the judge's discretion to increase the fine was already unrestricted—those involving minimum fines.

       A motor vehicle does not cease to be a motor vehicle whenever it cannot be started within the meaning of paragraph (a)(12) (now (a)(14)). Williams v. State, 884 P.2d 167 (Alaska Ct. App. 1994), overruled, State v. Coon, 974 P.2d 386 (Alaska 1999).

       A towed snowmobile is a motor vehicle because steering such a vehicle, even if only partially, involves exercising control over the vehicle, and it amounts to operating the vehicle; where a motorist was operating a towed snowmobile while intoxicated, and refused to submit to a chemical breath test under the implied consent law, his driver’s license was properly revoked. Conkey v. Dep't of Admin., 113 P.3d 1235 (Alaska 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was sufficient evidence that defendant was driving or operating a motor vehicle based on testimony that defendant was seen entering into and starting the truck and that she admitted that she started the truck. She was in actual physical control of the truck when she got into the truck and started the engine; thus, the evidence was sufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that she was operating the truck.

       Defendant was properly convicted of driving while license revoked and driving in violation of a restricted license because while someone else might have driven the car to an apartment complex, a witness observed defendant drive it to a different place in an alley, defendant did not question the nature of the alley, and a police detective testified that the alley was open to the public.
