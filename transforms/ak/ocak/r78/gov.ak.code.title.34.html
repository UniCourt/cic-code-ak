        This chapter constitutes a basic reform of landlord-tenant law,

        Harmonizing with forcible entry and detainer statutes. —

      <p>
       As a matter of statutory construction, this chapter should be harmonized with the forcible entry and detainer statutes. McCall v. Fickes, 556 P.2d 535 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Forcible entry and detainer procedures
       </b>
       may be used where not conflicting.

       <b>
        Preemption by federal law. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because federal law and its imposition of the duty of maintenance on the homebuyer under a home ownership opportunity program directly conflicts with the Landlord Tenant Act’s imposition of that duty on the landlord, the state legislation could not control this aspect of a mutual help and occupancy agreement, and the trial court erred in ruling that the duty of maintenance lay with the housing authority. Interior Regional Hous. Auth. v. James, 989 P.2d 145 (Alaska 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Defenses. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Defenses available under this chapter may be asserted in forcible entry and detainer proceedings. McCall v. Fickes, 556 P.2d 535 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       If this chapter’s defenses were not available in forcible entry and detainer proceedings, litigants would be faced with a situation in which the plaintiff, by choosing the statutory section under which to proceed, could limit the tenant’s right to assert defenses.
   This would clearly defeat this chapter’s express purpose to “. . . simplify, clarify, modernize and revise the law governing the rental of dwelling units and the rights and obligations of landlord and tenant.” McCall v. Fickes, 556 P.2d 535 (Alaska 1976).

        Resort to forcible entry and detainer action. —
       </b>

      <p>
       Landlord’s conduct, in accepting late rental payments with knowledge of the tenants’ defaults, did not bar resort to the institution of a forcible entry and detainer action. McCall v. Fickes, 556 P.2d 535 (Alaska 1976).

       The landlord’s duty of care was expanded to align Alaska with other jurisdictions, thus rejecting the traditional common law rule of landlord immunity, as it would be inconsistent with a landlord’s continuing duty to repair premises imposed under this chapter to exempt from tort liability a landlord who fails in this duty.

      <p>
       Rejection of the general rule of landlord immunity does not make landlords liable as insurers; their duty is to use reasonable care to discover and remedy conditions which present an unreasonable risk of harm under the circumstances. Nor does it mean that questions as to whether a dangerous condition existed in an area occupied solely by the tenant or in a common area, or whether the condition was apparent or hidden are irrelevant, as these are circumstances which must be accounted for in customary negligence analysis.

       Finding in favor of the landlord in the tenant’s action after she fell and sustained a back injury was proper because the jurors could have found that the contractor bore some responsibility for the condition of the stairs. Alternatively, reasonable jurors could have concluded that the contractor was not negligent. Heynen v. Fairbanks, 293 P.3d 470 (Alaska 2013).

      If the landlord unlawfully removes or excludes the tenant from the premises or wilfully diminishes services to the tenant by interrupting or causing the interruption of electric, gas, water, sanitary, or other essential service to the tenant, the tenant may recover possession or terminate the rental agreement and, in either case, recover an amount not to exceed one and one-half times the actual damages.

       Court declined to expose a landlord to the enhanced remedies of this section on a retaliatory eviction claim simply for evicting a tenant who was undisputedly not current on rent, absent notice that the tenant had a statutory right to reduced rent (e.g., per AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c03a05s34.03.200ol1a2" target="_self">34.03.200(a)(2)</a></cite>) or was entitled to reduced rent if the tenant made repairs or obtained substitute housing (e.g., per AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c03a05s34.03.180ol1a" target="_self">34.03.180(a)</a></cite>).

        Change in use of land. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A sufficient “change in the use of the land” occurred to qualify under this section where, following eviction of tenants’ mobile home, park operators used the space for parking construction vehicles and, later, as rental property for parking by travel trailers and recreational vehicles. Sharpe v. Trail, 902 P.2d 304 (Alaska 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no showing that park operators acted in bad faith in ordering the eviction of tenant’s mobile home for the purpose of changing the use of the land where it was established that, following the eviction, there was, in fact, a change in the use; evidence that the operators wanted to evict tenants because they found the mobile home unsightly did not, standing alone, support an inference that the operators acted in bad faith.

       When the rental agreement requires the tenant to give notice to the landlord of an anticipated extended absence in excess of seven days as required in AS 34.03.150 and the tenant wilfully fails to do so, the landlord may recover an amount not to exceed one and one-half times the actual damages.

       During an absence of the tenant in excess of seven days, the landlord may enter the dwelling unit at times reasonably necessary as provided in AS 34.03.140. The landlord may reenter the dwelling unit and, if there is evidence that the tenant has abandoned the dwelling unit, unless the landlord and tenant have made a specific agreement to the contrary, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement.

       If the tenant abandons the dwelling unit, the landlord shall make reasonable efforts to rent it at a fair rental value.  If the landlord rents the dwelling unit for a term beginning before the expiration of the rental agreement, the agreement is considered terminated on the date the new tenancy begins. The rental agreement is considered terminated by the landlord on the date the landlord has notice of the abandonment if the landlord fails to use reasonable efforts to rent the dwelling unit at a fair rental value or if the landlord accepts the abandonment as a surrender.  If the tenancy is from month to month, or week to week, the term of the rental agreement for purposes of this section shall be considered a month or a week, as the case may be.

      Acceptance of rent with knowledge of a default by the tenant or acceptance of performance by the tenant that varies from the terms of the rental agreement or rules or regulations subsequently adopted by the landlord constitutes a waiver of the right of the landlord to terminate the rental agreement for that breach, unless otherwise agreed after the breach has occurred.

       Rather than giving a right or remedy to the tenant, this section acts as a limitation upon the remedies of the landlord. McCall v. Fickes, 556 P.2d 535 (Alaska 1976).

       This section should be so interpreted that waiver of the “right to terminate” a rental agreement refers to rights which arise as a consequence of a breach, and does not concern rights of termination which exist regardless of whether or not a tenant breached a condition of the agreement. McCall v. Fickes, 556 P.2d 535 (Alaska 1976).

       Since a landlord always has the right to terminate the month-to-month rental agreement with the tenant, even without cause, by giving a month’s notice, he does not waive this right by accepting the late rental payment. McCall v. Fickes, 556 P.2d 535 (Alaska 1976).

       If the expiration or termination of a lease or a memorandum of the lease will terminate the common interest community or reduce its size, the lease or a memorandum of the lease must be recorded.  In a condominium or planned community, the lessor of each lease described in this subsection shall sign the declaration.  The declaration must state

       After the declaration for a leasehold condominium or leasehold planned community is recorded, and a plat or plan that is part of the declaration is filed and recorded, neither the lessor nor the successor in interest of the lessor may terminate the leasehold interest of a unit owner who makes timely payment of a unit owner’s share of the rent and otherwise complies with the covenants that, if violated, would entitle the lessor to terminate the lease.  The leasehold interest of a unit owner in a condominium or planned community is not affected by the failure of any other person to pay rent or fulfill a covenant.

       Unless all units are taken by eminent domain, or unless there has been a foreclosure of a security interest that has priority over the declaration against an entire cooperative, a common interest community may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units comprising either at least 80 percent of the votes in the association or any larger percentage specified in the declaration.  The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c08a02s34.08.260ol1b">
       An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the execution of a termination agreement or ratification of an agreement to terminate, in the same manner as a deed is executed by the required number of unit owners.  The termination agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date.  A termination agreement and each ratification of the termination agreement must be recorded in each recording district in which a portion of the common interest community is situated.  A termination agreement is effective only upon recording.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c08a02s34.08.260ol1c">
       If a condominium or planned community contains only units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide that all of the common elements and units of the common interest community must be sold following termination.  If, under the agreement, any real estate in the common interest community is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set out the minimum terms of the sale.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c08a02s34.08.260ol1d">
       If a condominium or planned community contains a unit not having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide for sale of the common elements, but it may not require that the unit be sold following termination unless the declaration as originally recorded provided otherwise or unless all unit owners consent to the sale.

       The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real estate in a common interest community, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved under (a) and (b) of this section.  If real estate is to be sold following termination, title to the real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. The association has at that time all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale.  Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds of the sale distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination.  Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to unit owners and lien holders as their interests may appear under (h), (i), and (j) of this section.  Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and the successor in interest of each unit owner has an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit.  During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and the successors in interest of each unit owner remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this chapter or the declaration.

       Each merger or consolidation agreement must provide for the reallocation of the allocated interests in the new association among the units of the resultant common interest community either (1) by stating the reallocations or the formulas upon which they are based or (2) by stating the percentage of overall allocated interests of the new common interest community that are allocated to all of the units comprising each of the preexisting common interest communities, and providing that the portion of the percentages allocated to each unit formerly comprising a part of the preexisting common interest community must be equal to the percentages of allocated interests allocated to the unit by the declaration of the preexisting common interest community.

       Except as provided in the declaration, the bylaws, (b) of this section, or other provisions of this chapter, the executive board may act in all instances on behalf of the association.

       Subject to (e) of this section, the declaration may provide for a period of declarant control of the association, during which a declarant or persons designated by the declarant may appoint and remove the officers and members of the executive board.  Regardless of the period provided in the declaration, a period of declarant control terminates no later than the earlier of: (1) 60 days after conveyance of 75 percent of the units that may be created to unit owners other than a declarant; (2) two years after all declarants have ceased to offer units for sale in the ordinary course of business; or (3) two years after any right to add new units was last exercised.  A declarant may voluntarily surrender the right to appoint and remove officers and members of the executive board before termination of the periods established in this subsection, but in that event the declarant may require, for the duration of the period of declarant control, that specified actions of the association or executive board, as described in a recorded instrument executed by the declarant, be approved by the declarant before they become effective.

      Neither the association nor any unit owner except the declarant is liable for the torts of the declarant in connection with any part of the common interest community that the declarant has the responsibility to maintain.
   An action alleging a wrong done by the association must be brought against the association and not against a unit owner.
   If the wrong occurred during a period of declarant control and the association gives the declarant reasonable notice of and an opportunity to defend against the action, the declarant who then controlled the association is liable to the association or to a unit owner for (1) tort losses not covered by insurance suffered by the association or the unit owner, and (2) each cost that the association would not have incurred but for a breach of contract or other wrongful act or omission. If the declarant is liable to the association under this section, the declarant is liable for the expenses of litigation incurred by the association.
   A statute of limitation affecting the right of action of the association under this section is tolled until the period of declarant control terminates.
   A unit owner is not precluded from maintaining an action under this section because the person is a unit owner or a member or officer of the association.

       The association has a lien on a unit for an assessment levied against the unit or fines imposed against its unit owner from the time the assessment or fine becomes due.  Unless the declaration otherwise provides, fees, charges, late charges, fines, and interest charged under  AS 34.08.320(a)(10) — (12) are enforceable as assessments under this section.  If an assessment is payable in installments, the full amount of the assessment is a lien from the time the first installment becomes due.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c08a03s34.08.470ol1b">
       A lien under this section is prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a unit except (1) a lien and encumbrance recorded before the recordation of the declaration and, in a cooperative, a lien and encumbrance which the association creates, assumes, or takes subject to; (2) a first security interest on the unit recorded before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent, or, in a cooperative, the first security interest encumbering only the interest of the unit owner and perfected before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent; and (3) a lien for real estate taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against the unit or cooperative.  A lien under this section is also prior to all security interests described in (2) of this subsection if the common expense assessments based on the periodic budget adopted by the association under  AS 34.08.460(a) would have become due in the absence of acceleration during the six months immediately preceding institution of an action to enforce the lien.  This subsection does not affect the priority of a mechanic’s or materialman’s lien, or the priority of a lien for other assessments made by the association.  A lien under this section is not subject to the provisions of  AS 09.38.010.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c08a03s34.08.470ol1c">
       Unless the declaration provides otherwise, if two or more associations have liens for assessments created at any time on the same property, each lien has equal priority.

       The recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien.  Further recording of a claim of lien for assessment under this section is not required.

       A lien for an unpaid assessment is extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien are instituted within three years after the full amount of the assessment becomes due.

       Assessment does not become valid only when it attaches as a lien. Debts can exist before they are due, and condominium assessments can be effective before they must be paid. Soules v. Ramstack, 95 P.3d 933 (Alaska 2004).

       Superior court did not err when it included a special assessment and associated late fees in a condominium association's judgment because the association's failure to list the assessment in the statement did not void the owners' obligation to pay it; the condominium owner had actual knowledge of the assessment when the association sent him a statement omitting it and conceded at oral argument that its omission did not prejudice him.

       A declarant of a common interest community containing conversion property, and any dealer who intends to offer units in a common interest community containing conversion units, shall give each residential tenant and each residential subtenant in possession of a portion of conversion property notice of the conversion and provide each person with the public offering statement no later than 180 days before the tenant and any subtenant in possession are required to vacate.  If the conversion property consists of a mobile home park, notice of the conversion and delivery of a public offering statement shall be provided no later than one year before the tenant and any subtenant in possession are required to vacate. The notice must set out generally the rights of tenants and subtenants under this section and shall be hand delivered to the tenant or subtenant in possession or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the tenant and subtenant at the address of the unit or any other mailing address provided by a tenant.  The failure to give notice as required by this section is a defense to an action for possession and the terms of the tenancy may not be altered during the notice period provided by this subsection.  A tenant or subtenant may not be required to vacate upon less than 180 days’ notice and a tenant and a subtenant in possession in a mobile home park may not be required to vacate upon less than one year’s notice except for one of the following reasons:

       For 90 days after delivery or mailing of the notice described in (a) of this section, the person required to give the notice shall offer to convey each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use to the tenant who leases or rents the unit. If a tenant fails to purchase the unit during the 90-day period, the offeror shall extend a right of first refusal to the tenant who is leasing or renting the unit at the time of the conversion.  The offeror may not offer to dispose of an interest in the unit at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant while the tenant is in possession.  The tenant must exercise the right of first refusal within 90 days from the receipt of the offer and must provide the offeror a valid letter of intent or a preliminary loan commitment from a bank or mortgage lending institution within 30 days of receipt of the offer. This subsection does not apply to a unit in conversion property if the unit will be restricted exclusively to nonresidential use or if the boundaries of the converted unit do not substantially conform to the dimensions of the residential unit before conversion.

       Statute concerning common interest ownership was not applicable when the owners of an adjacent lot sued a property owner after the owner without prior approval cut down trees on the owner's lot that were protected by the subdivision's declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CCRs) because the subdivision was not a common interest community in that the CCRs did not satisfy the definitional requirement for a common interest community. Accordingly, the owners did not have a basis for a punitive damages award. Galipeau v. Bixby, 476 P.3d 1129 (Alaska 2020).

       Statute concerning common interest ownership was not applicable when the owners of an adjacent lot sued a property owner after the owner without prior approval cut down trees on the owner's lot that were protected by the subdivision's declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CCRs) because the subdivision was not a common interest community in that the CCRs did not satisfy the definitional requirement for a common interest community. Accordingly, the owners did not have a basis for a punitive damages award. Galipeau v. Bixby, 476 P.3d 1129 (Alaska 2020).

      <p>
       Deceased husband’s surviving spouse properly vacated a deed of trust the husband granted to the husband’s girlfriend on the family home because the spouse’s interest in the home survived the husband’s death, and the spouse moved to vacate the deed of trust within one year of the date of recording.

        Action may not be maintained on defectively executed lease. —

       Where a statute requires a lease for a term of years to be under seal, witnessed, acknowledged, or recorded, to be valid, an action of covenant, on a lease not executed with these formalities, cannot be maintained, though the lessees enter under the lease.

        Homestead interest. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A homestead interest under this section is not a restriction on alienation and only as it regards rights to occupancy will it be treated as such. Spracher v. Spracher, 17 Alaska 698 (D. Alaska 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The homestead right was created to protect the family from total loss of its abode due to judgments and executions on unsatisfied debts.
   It was not enacted, as this section clearly states, to create any new right, title or interest other than the right of occupancy in property used as a homestead by members of the family. Spracher v. Spracher, 17 Alaska 698 (D. Alaska 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where plaintiff has proved no proprietary right, title or interest in property, under this section the plaintiff’s homestead interest is what is commonly referred to as a “worrying asset” during coverture.
   Thus plaintiff has a right to occupy the homestead during coverture regardless of third party’s title to the property, but plaintiff obtains no right, title or interest in the property by this occupancy. Spracher v. Spracher, 17 Alaska 698 (D. Alaska 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where no right, title or interest is created in a spouse other than what was vested in that spouse already, homestead rights in husband’s property do not survive the divorce. Spracher v. Spracher, 17 Alaska 698 (D. Alaska 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Objection that a first mortgage was invalid on the ground that the mortgage was not signed by the husband of the mortgagor, a prerequisite under this section to the validity of a conveyance of property which includes the homestead, is not available to a third person, but only to the possessor of the homestead right. Arnold v. Kelsey, 114 F. Supp. 650, 14 Alaska 387 (D. Alaska 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       A bona fide purchaser for value without actual or constructive notice of a homestead may take free of any adverse claim based upon such an interest. Spracher v. Spracher, 17 Alaska 698 (D. Alaska 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a vacant property sold by a wife was no longer the family residence, it did not constitute a home or homestead and this section did not protect any interest of the husband’s in the property. Gottstein v. Kraft, 274 P.3d 469 (Alaska 2012).

       Legislation which enacted
   AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c15a01s34.15.075" target="_self">34.15.075</a></cite> sought to affect conveyances of Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act real property by quitclaim deed, in some cases changing the common law rule that estoppel by deed does not apply when a conveyance is made by quitclaim deed. While the purpose of the legislation was to clear title related to subsurface use of the property when it is conveyed by quitclaim deed by village corporations, it raised concerns regarding retroactive application and equal protection.

      <p>
       The initial presumption is that each of two parties owned an equal undivided share in property deeded to both. If, however, it is shown that the parties contributed unequally to the equity in the property, a presumption arises that they intended to share the property in proportion to their respective contributions.

      </p>

       The wrong consists in one of two or more cotenants receiving more than his just proportion of the profits of the estate owned by him and his cotenant or cotenants in common; the remedy provided for the cotenant aggrieved by the wrong is to maintain an action.

       By the common law a cotenant of a mining claim is given the right to mine and operate the claim subject to the right of the other cotenants to use and mine the claim at the same time; but a cotenant who does not exercise the right to use the claim in this manner is not invested with the power to call upon the working cotenant for an accounting of the profits he may make in operating the claim.

       It is inconceivable that the law should put in the aggrieved cotenant’s hand the remedy of this section, unless it meant to confer upon him the right, which necessarily goes with the remedy, to have a share in the profits proportionate to the quantity of his interest in the land.

       Under the laws of Alaska a cotenant or co-owner conducting mining operations independently of his cotenant or co-owner is accountable to such cotenant or co-owner for profits made in the operation.
   It follows, therefore, that one cotenant cannot limit the other to an interest in the royalty provided for in the lease. Pilgrim v. Grant, 9 Alaska 17 (D. Alaska 1936), modified, 95 F.2d 562, 9 Alaska 241 (9th Cir. Alaska 1938).

        Formal execution is not required for validity between parties. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is well established that, in the absence of statutory requirement, acknowledgments are not essential to the validity of an instrument as between the immediate parties and their privies.
   This rule is particularly applicable in cases where a deed is relied upon as creating an estoppel.
   James v. Nelson, 90 F.2d 910, 9 Alaska 117 (9th Cir. Alaska), cert. denied, 302 U.S. 721, 58 S. Ct. 41, 82 L. Ed. 556 (U.S. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of requiring that the execution of deeds be attested by witnesses was to entitle the conveyance to be recorded, and while compliance therewith was essential to registration, a failure to comply did not affect the common-law rule that a deed signed, sealed, and delivered is good as between the parties. Eadie v. Chambers, 172 F. 73, 3 Alaska Fed. 396 (9th Cir. Alaska 1909), rev'd, 224 U.S. 564, 32 S. Ct. 597, 56 L. Ed. 885 (U.S. 1912).

        Signed instrument not witnessed, acknowledged, or recorded. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An instrument in writing, signed by the parties, may serve as one step in the conveyance of real estate, although it is neither witnessed, acknowledged, nor recorded. Such an instrument, containing apt words to convey, when made, signed, and delivered to the grantee, and followed by acts constituting estoppel, becomes sufficient, as between grantor and grantee, to convey the legal title. Morency v. Floyd, 2 Alaska 194 (D. Alaska 1904); James v. Nelson, 90 F.2d 910, 9 Alaska 117 (9th Cir. Alaska), cert. denied, 302 U.S. 721, 58 S. Ct. 41, 82 L. Ed. 556 (U.S. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Witnesses, acknowledgment, and record add nothing to the agreement between the parties.
   They are formalities required by the law, and become prima facie evidence only of the final conclusion of the contract. Morency v. Floyd, 2 Alaska 194 (D. Alaska 1904); James v. Nelson, 90 F.2d 910, 9 Alaska 117 (9th Cir. Alaska), cert. denied, 302 U.S. 721, 58 S. Ct. 41, 82 L. Ed. 556 (U.S. 1937).

      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to comply with the acknowledgment requirement does not make an instrument invalid as between the parties to it, but rather only precludes its recordation and thus its effectiveness as against third persons. Smalley v. Juneau Clinic Bldg. Corp., 493 P.2d 1296 (Alaska 1972).

An inaccuracy in the street address may not be used to set aside a sale if the legal description is correct. At any time before the sale date stated in the notice of default or to which the sale is postponed under AS 34.20.080(e), if the default has arisen by failure to make payments required by the trust deed, the default may be cured and sale under this section terminated by payment of the sum then in default, other than the principal that would not then be due if no default had occurred, and attorney and other foreclosure fees and costs actually incurred by the beneficiary and trustee due to the default.

       Superior court erred in granting a borrower’s motion for summary judgment because, in returning a beneficiary of a deed of trust to its status quo ante when a borrower reinstated after a default, Alaska Trustee could statutorily include all reasonable costs incurred pursuing a foreclosure regardless of whether the deed of trust specifically provided for the inclusion of such costs, and the Unfair Trade Practices Act did not apply to nonjudicial deed of trust foreclosures.

       While noncompliance with the statutory provisions regarding foreclosure by the power under a mortgage or trust deed is not to be favored, the remedy of setting aside the sale will be applied only in cases which reach unjust extremes. Semlek v. National Bank, 458 P.2d 1003 (Alaska 1969).

      <p>
       Trial court did not err when it set aside a foreclosure sale of two parcels, both on the basis of inadequate price, where the foreclosure purchase price was less than 15 percent of the sale price; and because the sale was part of a sale in bulk rather than selling only one parcel, the trustee had failed in her duty to act reasonably to protect the debtor’s interests.

      <p>
       Application of the 1976 amendment to this section, which among other things added the second and third sentences of subsection (b), to deeds of trust executed before but foreclosed after the amendment became effective is not prohibited by the contract clause of the federal constitution. Hagberg v. Alaska Nat'l Bank, 585 P.2d 559 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no violation of the contract clause by the application to pre-existing deeds of trust of the 1976 amendment, changing the law regarding payments required to terminate a nonjudicial deed of trust sale.
   An obligor on a note must still pay the principal and interest and, in case of default, the beneficiary is still entitled to foreclosure and to his costs. The beneficiary is deprived of his right to insist on payment of the entire debt as a condition to stopping the nonjudicial foreclosure process where the overdue amount is brought current and costs are paid.
   However, the defaulting obligor may bring his payments current and stop the nonjudicial foreclosure as a matter of right only twice; the third time the beneficiary may insist on payment in full. This modification does not reduce the value of a beneficiary’s note or the security ensuring payment in any perceptible way. Hagberg v. Alaska Nat'l Bank, 585 P.2d 559 (Alaska 1978).

      <p>
       A secured creditor initially may ignore the security and sue for a personal judgment on the underlying debt, absent an agreement to the contrary.
   Once the creditor obtains a personal judgment which is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, the creditor may judicially or nonjudicially foreclose the security. Moening v. Alaska Mut. Bank, 751 P.2d 5 (Alaska 1988).

      <p>
       Where the terms of a note and deed of trust did not limit the secured creditors to the remedy of nonjudicial foreclosure of their security, the creditors’ subsequent claim for judicial foreclosure of that security was not precluded by the judgment in a prior suit on the note.

       Right of equitable redemption on a deed of trust extends beyond the obligor to every other person who has an interest in, or legal or equitable lien upon, the mortgaged premises; therefore, the right of cure granted by subsection (b) of this section should extend to those persons; however, this equitable right would not extend to mere occupants or possessors lacking any claim to the property.

      <p>
       Where owners of rental properties received a disaster relief loan from the Small Business Administration which loan was secured by deeds of trust on three parcels of property, the deeds providing that federal law will govern, that the parties waive any local immunity, and that the trustor shall be liable and agrees to pay any deficiency, the SBA should be permitted to recover the deficiency despite AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c20a02s34.20.100" target="_self">34.20.100</a></cite>, which prohibits recovery of deficiency judgments after summary foreclosure pursuant to a power of sale under a deed of trust. United States v. Gish, 559 F.2d 572 (9th Cir. Alaska 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 996, 98 S. Ct. 1648, 56 L. Ed. 2d 85 (U.S. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under 15 U.S.C. § 634(b)(4), deficiency judgments are authorized when the loan is secured by a deed of trust. Examination of the statute and its legislative history demonstrates that Congress, with respect to Small Business Administration loan transactions, intended the term “mortgage” to be used in its broader, generic sense. Moreover, the differences in foreclosure methods between a mortgage and a deed of trust under Alaska law do not exist nationwide.
   A consistent application of the statute in all jurisdictions is necessary to effectuate the underlying congressional goals.
   This requires that the SBA be allowed to recover deficiencies whenever federal law applies and there has been a default on a loan secured by real property. United States v. Gish, 559 F.2d 572 (9th Cir. Alaska 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 996, 98 S. Ct. 1648, 56 L. Ed. 2d 85 (U.S. 1978).

       The trust deed notice statute contemplates physical inspection of the property before the sale by the trustee or beneficiary.
   The statute requires the trustee to check the record and visit the property for a determination of whether there is another person occupying or in possession of the property.
   In order to insure that all interested parties, including those without recorded interests, have notice of the foreclosure, the trustee or beneficiary should inspect the property. Nystrom v. Buckhorn Homes, 778 P.2d 1115 (Alaska 1989).

        Section not applicable to judicial foreclosure sales. —

      <p>
       The loan obligation secured by a deed of trust is not completely extinguished as a matter of law at the time of a non-judicial foreclosure sale. This section contemplates the survival of a loan “obligation” following the sale, but precludes the lender from seeking any “deficiency” on this obligation either from the debtor or from the debtor’s guarantor.

        A mortgagee’s offset bid

       First lienholder, which sold fire-damaged property at non-judicial foreclosure sale, was only entitled to recover an amount of fire insurance proceeds sufficient to satisfy the outstanding debt. Any remaining proceeds were to be passed on to junior lienholders and/or the mortgagor as their interests appear. Fireman's Fund Mortgage Corp. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 838 P.2d 790 (Alaska 1992).

       Where first lienholder’s bid at its non-judicial foreclosure sale was based on a mutual mistake as to the condition of the property which had been damaged by fire, the first lienholder was bargaining for an undamaged property and did not obtain the benefit of its bargain; therefore, reformation of the sales price was appropriate.

       Because creditor timely filed its claim against debtor, subsequent foreclosure of its secured claim did not preclude it from participating in distribution from bankruptcy estate on its unsecured claim; trustee did not identify any reason under Alaska law why claim was not valid as of petition date and therefore trustee's objection to creditor's unsecured claim under this section was without merit.

        Recovery of deficiency judgment under federal law. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Where owners of rental properties received a disaster relief loan from the Small Business Administration, which loan was secured by deeds of trust on three parcels of property, the deeds providing that federal law will govern, that the parties waive any local immunity, and that the trustor shall be liable and agrees to pay any deficiency, the SBA should be permitted to recover the deficiency despite AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c20a02s34.20.100" target="_self">34.20.100</a></cite>, which prohibits recovery of deficiency judgments after summary foreclosure pursuant to a power of sale under a deed of trust. United States v. Gish, 559 F.2d 572 (9th Cir. Alaska 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 996, 98 S. Ct. 1648, 56 L. Ed. 2d 85 (U.S. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under 15 U.S.C. § 634(b)(4), deficiency judgments are authorized when the loan is secured by a deed of trust. Examination of the statute and its legislative history demonstrates that Congress, with respect to Small Business Administration loan transactions, intended the term “mortgage” to be used in its broader, generic sense. Moreover, the differences in foreclosure methods between a mortgage and a deed of trust under Alaska law do not exist nationwide.
   A consistent application of the statute in all jurisdictions is necessary to effectuate the underlying congressional goals.
   This requires that the SBA be allowed to recover deficiencies whenever federal law applies and there has been a default on a loan secured by real property. United States v. Gish, 559 F.2d 572 (9th Cir. Alaska 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 996, 98 S. Ct. 1648, 56 L. Ed. 2d 85 (U.S. 1978).

       A secured creditor initially may ignore the security and sue for a personal judgment on the underlying debt, absent an agreement to the contrary.
   Once the creditor obtains a personal judgment which is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, the creditor may judicially or nonjudicially foreclose the security. Moening v. Alaska Mut. Bank, 751 P.2d 5 (Alaska 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the terms of a note and deed of trust did not limit the secured creditors to the remedy of nonjudicial foreclosure of their security, the creditors’ subsequent claim for judicial foreclosure of that security was not precluded by the judgment in a prior suit on the note.

       Before performing the duties of a trustee under AS 34.20.070 and 34.20.080, a person shall obtain a surety bond in the amount of $100,000 to protect the trustors and beneficiaries of trust deeds against fraud or defalcation by the trustee in the performance of the duties.

       The bond required by (a) of this section must be a bond that is terminable at any time by the surety by sending written notice by first class United States mail to the obligee and the principal at the address for each that is last known by the surety, and to the department. The bond terminates when 45 days have expired after the date the notice is mailed. The surety is not liable for an act or omission of the principal that occurs after the termination. The surety is not liable after the termination for more than the face amount of the bond, regardless of the number of claims made against the bond or the number of years the bond remains in force. A revision of the amount of the bond is not cumulative.

       The question of whether or not the lien of a mortgage expires by operation of law prior to the beginning of suit is governed by AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.09.html#t09c10s09.10.040" target="_blank">09.10.040</a></cite> and AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.09.html#t09c10s09.10.050" target="_blank">09.10.050</a></cite>, since this section provides in substance that the lien of a mortgage shall expire by operation of law unless prior to the expiration of the statutory time for bringing suit thereon a payment is made and a memorandum of such payment recorded in the recording district where the real estate is situated. Carklin v. Grigsby, 9 Alaska 378 (D. Alaska 1938).

        Limitation period governing foreclosure action. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The portion of Alaska’s Code of Civil Procedure which deals with limitation of actions does not contain any provision which specifically establishes a limitation period governing the foreclosure of either legal or equitable mortgages. Dworkin v. First Nat'l Bank, 444 P.2d 777 (Alaska 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of a controlling statute a foreclosure action is subject to the same period of limitations as the underlying debt. Dworkin v. First Nat'l Bank, 444 P.2d 777 (Alaska 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       The six-year statute of limitations (AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.09.html#t09c10s09.10.050" target="_blank">09.10.050</a></cite>), which governs the underlying obligation, is determinative of the period of time in which a party is required to commence an action to foreclose a purported equitable mortgage security. Dworkin v. First Nat'l Bank, 444 P.2d 777 (Alaska 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a suit to foreclose a mortgage the six-year period of limitation is controlling and the ten-year period pertaining to actions upon sealed instruments is inapplicable. Dworkin v. First Nat'l Bank, 444 P.2d 777 (Alaska 1968).

       Under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c20a03s34.20.140" target="_self">34.20.140</a></cite>, when payment is made on a contract secured by a real estate lien, the payment will not extend the lien unless a memorandum of payment is recorded.

       When a lender uses a note as evidence of an obligation secured by a mortgage or deed of trust, the note must affirmatively advise the mortgagor or trustor and any other party bound by the note if the mortgagee or beneficiary wants the option to bring suit directly on the note to collect an amount owing under the note without first foreclosing the mortgage or deed of trust. This option must be stated in writing within the note or as a separate document. If a note executed after May 24, 1988 fails to contain the notice specified in this section, the debt secured by the mortgage or deed of trust may be foreclosed under AS 09.45.170 — 09.45.220 or AS 34.20.070 — 34.20.135.

        Constitutionality. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The Ninth Circuit has held that provisions for the award of costs and attorney’s fees only to lien claimants was constitutionally permissible. Brand v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 478 P.2d 829 (Alaska 1970).

        Origin. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section was taken, without significant change, from the laws of Oregon. Brand v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 478 P.2d 829 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time this section was adopted for the Territory of Alaska, and subsequent thereto, the courts of Oregon had consistently held that the lien claimant carried the burden of both alleging and proving the reasonable amount of attorney’s fees he was entitled to on foreclosure.
   Absent these prerequisites, it was held that the claimant was not entitled to an award of attorney’s fees.
   It further appears that the statutes were construed as granting some discretion in the courts in regard to the determination of a reasonable attorney’s fee. Brand v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 478 P.2d 829 (Alaska 1970).

        The safe and proper rule of construction
       </b>
       of mechanic’s lien statutes is that, while the remedial portions of the statutes should be liberally construed, with a view to avoid defeating the purpose of the statute, yet those parts upon which the right to the existence of a lien depends, being in derogation of the common law, should be strictly construed. Sullens &amp; Hoss, Inc. v. Farvour, 117 F. Supp. 535, 14 Alaska 492 (D. Alaska 1954).

      <p>
       Generally, some latitude is permitted by statutes as to the form in which the oath or affirmation as to the truth of the contents of the lien claim may be administered, and substantial compliance with such form is often sufficient. However, there is a significant distinction between those portions of Alaska mechanics’ liens statutes which are remedial in nature, and those portions which articulate mandatory conditions precedent to the very creation and existence of the lien.
   It is the latter aspect of Alaska’s mechanics’ and materialmen’s lien statutory provisions which is at issue in a case concerning whether an affiant or claimant must swear to the truth of the contents of the claim. H.A.M.S. Co. v. Electrical Contractors, 563 P.2d 258 (Alaska 1977).

        Constitutionality of lien laws. —

       <b>
        Origin. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The mechanic’s lien law of Alaska was adopted originally from the lien law of Oregon. Arctic Lumber Co. v. Borden, 211 F. 50, 4 Alaska Fed. 151 (9th Cir. Alaska), cert. denied, 235 U.S. 704, 35 S. Ct. 209, 59 L. Ed. 433 (U.S. 1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska mechanic’s lien laws were derived from those of Oregon. Vaara v. Ketchikan Spruce Mills, 432 P.2d 618 (Alaska 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Purpose. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of legislatures in enacting mechanic’s and materialman’s lien laws is for the protection of the mechanic, insuring to him the fruits of his labor and providing the materialman with a speedy and efficacious mode of collecting his pay for materials furnished. Jorgensen Co. v. Sheldon, 2 Alaska 607 (D. Alaska 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the purpose of the lien law to secure priority of payment of the price and value of work performed and materials furnished in erecting and repairing a building or other structure. Cascaden v. Wimbish, 161 F. 241, 3 Alaska Fed. 73 (9th Cir. Alaska 1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Exclusive remedy. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory mechanics’ lien scheme, of which the stop-payment statute is a part, constitutes a complete remedy that preempts common-law and equitable remedies. Donnybrook Bldg. Supply Co. v. Alaska Nat'l Bank, 736 P.2d 1147 (Alaska 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the statutory mechanics’ lien scheme constitutes a complete remedy that preempts common law and equitable remedies, construction lenders are not shielded from liability for breach of contracts or tortious conduct. Great W. Sav. Bank v. George W. Easley Co., 778 P.2d 569 (Alaska 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Liberal construction. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This article relating to mechanics’ liens should be liberally construed. Russell v. Hayner, 130 F. 90, 2 Alaska Fed. 271 (9th Cir. Alaska 1904); Arctic Lumber Co. v. Borden, 211 F. 50, 4 Alaska Fed. 151 (9th Cir. Alaska), cert. denied, 235 U.S. 704, 35 S. Ct. 209, 59 L. Ed. 433 (U.S. 1914). But see Goldstein v. Noble, 6 Alaska 282 (D. Alaska 1920).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evident spirit and purpose of this article is to do substantial justice to all parties who may be affected by its provisions, and the courts should avoid unfriendly strictness and mere technicality. Russell v. Hayner, 130 F. 90, 2 Alaska Fed. 271 (9th Cir. Alaska 1904).

       Mechanic’s lien statutes are to be liberally construed, with a view to effect substantial justice, and the fact that the lien claimant includes in his claim an item of his services for which the law gives him no lien will not defeat the lien if due to an honest mistake, and his lien in such a case may be enforced pro tanto if the true amount for which he is entitled to a lien may be segregated from the remainder. Pioneer Mining Co. v. Delamotte, 185 F. 752, 3 Alaska Fed. 564 (9th Cir. Alaska 1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the particular enactment deals fairly and equitably with both the owner and the lienor, the liberal interpretation seems to be the rule adopted; but where the statute seems to be unnecessarily severe upon one, and in favor of the other, resulting in manifest injustice, the courts have endeavored to relieve the severity, holding the party favored to a strict compliance with the statute. Jorgensen Co. v. Sheldon, 2 Alaska 607 (D. Alaska 1905).

       The safe and proper rule of construction of mechanic’s lien statutes is that, while the remedial portions of these statutes should be liberally construed, with a view to avoid defeating the purpose of the statute, yet those parts upon which the right to the existence of a lien depend, being in derogation of the common law, should be strictly construed.

       A mechanic’s lien is purely of statutory creation, and can only be maintained by a substantial observance and compliance with the provisions of the statute.
   Whatever is made necessary to the existence of the lien must be performed, or the attempt to create it will be futile.
   A substantial adherence to the terms of the statute in the notice of the lien is indispensable. Russell v. Hayner, 130 F. 90, 2 Alaska Fed. 271 (9th Cir. Alaska 1904).

       <b>
        No lien exists until the claim of lien is filed

        Construction of introductory language of subsection (c) mandated. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A construction of subsection (c)(5) as it existed prior to the 1978 amendment (now the introductory language of subsection (c)) which requires that the claim of lien be verified by the oath of the claimant or another person having knowledge of the facts as essential to the existence of the lien, is mandated.
   H.A.M.S. Co. v. Electrical Contractors, 563 P.2d 258 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Policy considerations underlying verification requirement. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement of verification is reflective of the legislature’s awareness that a claim of lien adversely affects the title to the property and its alienability; that the claim of lien can have an injurious impact on the credit of the owner of the property which is subjected to the lien; and that the claim of lien can be used as a vehicle to coerce settlement from the owner of the property. H.A.M.S. Co. v. Electrical Contractors, 563 P.2d 258 (Alaska 1977); Brooks v. R &amp; M Consultants, 613 P.2d 268 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Reasonable basis exists for verification requirement. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In light of the important policy considerations underlying the verification requirement, there exists a reasonable basis for the legislature’s determination that the significance of filing a lien claim be made clear to the lien claimant through the requirement of verification and the possibility of perjury prosecution for verifying a false lien claim. H.A.M.S. Co. v. Electrical Contractors, 563 P.2d 258 (Alaska 1977); Brooks v. R &amp; M Consultants, 613 P.2d 268 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        And no latitude is permitted concerning such requirement. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally, some latitude is permitted by statutes as to the form in which the oath or affirmation as to the truth of the contents of the lien claim may be administered, and substantial compliance with such form is often sufficient. However, there is a significant distinction between those portions of Alaska mechanics’ liens statutes which are remedial in nature, and those portions which articulate mandatory conditions precedent to the very creation and existence of the lien.
   It is the latter aspect of Alaska’s mechanics’ and materialmen’s lien statutory provisions which is at issue in a case concerning whether an affiant or claimant must swear to the truth of the contents of the claim. H.A.M.S. Co. v. Electrical Contractors, 563 P.2d 258 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The operative, substantive requirement of subsection (c)
       </b>
       is that the claim be verified; that the verification be “by oath of the claimant” simply describes the means or procedure to be followed in verifying the claim. Therefore, substantial compliance with the formal requirement of an oath is sufficient. Anchorage Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. Wooldridge, 619 P.2d 1014 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Verification requirement substantially unchanged. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although Alaska’s mechanics’ and materialmen’s statutes have been substantially revised in recent years, the verification requirement of subsection (c) of this section has remained substantially unchanged. Anchorage Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. Wooldridge, 619 P.2d 1014 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Claims of lien are not valid liens where there is failure to meet the verification requirements
       </b>
       of subsection (c)(5) as it existed prior to the 1978 amendment [now the introductory language of subsection (c)]. H.A.M.S. Co. v. Electrical Contractors, 563 P.2d 258 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        No particular form of oath or affirmation is required
       </b>
       by Alaska law, other than that when a notary certifies an oath or affirmation, the oath or affirmation must be made in the notary’s presence. Anchorage Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. Wooldridge, 619 P.2d 1014 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        What is verification. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A verification is a sworn statement of the truth of the facts stated in the instrument which is verified. H.A.M.S. Co. v. Electrical Contractors, 563 P.2d 258 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a lien claimant, in the presence of a notary, affixes his signature to a written statement incorporating the necessary elements of a claim of lien, and the notary certifies this act, claimant has substantially complied with the requirement of an “oath.” Anchorage Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. Wooldridge, 619 P.2d 1014 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A verification differs from an acknowledgment
       </b>
       in that the latter is a method of authenticating an instrument by showing that it was the act of the person executing it. H.A.M.S. Co. v. Electrical Contractors, 563 P.2d 258 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        An acknowledgment is not sufficient
       </b>
       to satisfy a mechanics’ lien statute which requires verification of the claim of lien by the claimant.
   H.A.M.S. Co. v. Electrical Contractors, 563 P.2d 258 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporate acknowledgments affixed to the claims of lien do not constitute substantial compliance with the verification requirement of subsection (c)(5) of this section as it existed prior to the 1978 amendment (now the introductory language of subsection (c)) under

       It is necessary that the statement of the lienors’ demand contained in the notices should be the true amount due, after making deductions for all just credits and offsets, but it is not necessary that such shall be expressly stated in the notices filed. Irvine v. McDougall, 4 Alaska 702 (D. Alaska 1913).

        Inclusion of improper item voids lien. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Where a lien claimant includes in his lien statement an item not embraced in the statutory lien, for labor, such as for expenses of transportation, he loses his lien. Bloom v. McCluskey, 7 Alaska 349 (D. Alaska 1925).

        Unless mistake is honest and items may be separated. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a lien claimant includes in his claim, through an honest mistake, a claim for services for which the statute gives him no lien, will not defeat the lien for other services within the statute also claimed, if the two can be separated.
   Irvine v. McDougal, 5 Alaska 220 (D. Alaska 1915), citing
   Pioneer Mining Co. v. Delamotte, 185 F. 752, 3 Alaska Fed. 564 (9th Cir. Alaska 1911).

       <b>
        Failure to include names of all owners does not invalidate notice. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       While this section requires that the notice of lien recorded shall contain the names of the owners, or reputed owners, of the ground upon which the lien is claimed, it is well established that failure to include all of the owners does not render the notice invalid, but that it may be enforced against the owners named. Turner v. Enstrom, 5 Alaska 118 (D. Alaska 1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The only effect of the omission of the name of any owner is to exempt his interest
       </b>

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Nor does failure to include district where property is located void notice. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It must appear somewhere in the complaint that the property sought to be charged with the lien is situated within the jurisdiction of the court, but it does not necessarily follow that the notices of lien are absolutely void simply because they do not contain the name of the mining district or political division in which the mining claim is situated.
   Irvine v. McDougall, 4 Alaska 702 (D. Alaska 1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       To hold that notices of lien are absolutely void for the reason that they do not contain the name of the precinct in which a quartz mining claim is located, when the precinct is named in the complaint to which the several notices are attached as exhibits, would be a failure to give to the notices of lien the liberal construction to which they are entitled in order that the very purpose of the statute may not be defeated. Irvine v. McDougal, 5 Alaska 220 (D. Alaska 1915).

       <b>
        If description is otherwise sufficient. —

      </p>
      <p>
       It is not absolutely necessary that the name of the state or territory, or of the legal subdivision thereof, wherein the premises to be charged are situated, be contained in the notice of lien, provided there is sufficient in the notice, taken in connection with all the circumstances and the place where the notice is filed or recorded, to apprise parties dealing with the property that a lien is claimed thereon. Irvine v. McDougall, 4 Alaska 702 (D. Alaska 1913).

        Complaint must show notice complies with this section. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this section requires that the notice of lien filed with the recorder set up certain facts, where the plaintiff’s allegation as to the notice of the lien fails to show that the notice filed contains these statements, such statements would not even substantially comply with the statute, and hence the lien would not be created. Jorgensen Co. v. Sheldon, 2 Alaska 607 (D. Alaska 1905).

       Not only should plaintiffs state the essential facts, as required by this section, but the better practice would be to plead the notice verbatim, or attach a copy thereof and make it a part of the complaint. Jorgensen Co. v. Sheldon, 2 Alaska 607 (D. Alaska 1905).

      </p>
      <p>
       The form of oath followed by the words “subscribed and sworn to before me,” and the notary public’s signature, amounts in substance to a certificate by the notary that the claim of lien was verified by the oath of the claimant.

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       While mechanic’s lien statutes are to be liberally construed, with a view to effecting substantial justice, a different rule should be followed in determining the effect of the pleading in an action to foreclose a lien, especially where the pleading is questioned at an early stage of the action, from the rule to be followed in determining the sufficiency of a notice of lien, which the lienor cannot correct or amend after the time limited for filing has expired. The complaint in an action of this kind should state all the ultimate facts necessary to be established upon the trial. Irvine v. McDougall, 4 Alaska 702 (D. Alaska 1913).

        Constitutionality. —

      </p>
      <p>
       There is no ground for saying that the allowance of reasonable attorney fees in the lien law is unconstitutional. Cascaden v. Wimbish, 161 F. 241, 3 Alaska Fed. 73 (9th Cir. Alaska 1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Ninth Circuit has held that provision for the award of costs and attorney’s fees only to lien claimants was constitutionally permissible.

        Origin. —

      </p>
      <p>
       This section was taken, without significant change, from the laws of Oregon. Brand v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 478 P.2d 829 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time this section was adopted for the Territory of Alaska, and subsequent thereto, the courts of Oregon had consistently held that the lien claimant carried the burden of both alleging and proving the reasonable amount of attorney’s fees he was entitled to on foreclosure.
   Absent these prerequisites, it was held that the claimant was not entitled to an award of attorney’s fees.
   It further appears that the statutes were construed as granting some discretion in the courts in regard to the determination of a reasonable attorney’s fee. Brand v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 478 P.2d 829 (Alaska 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The apparent purpose of this section
       </b>
       is to facilitate enforcement by mechanics’ lienors of their rights by giving them an assurance of costs and attorney’s fees if they prevail in their foreclosure actions. Brand v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 478 P.2d 829 (Alaska 1970); Rosson v. Boyd, 727 P.2d 765 (Alaska 1986).

       The purpose of this section is to provide a lien upon mines and mining property for laborers and miners doing work in, on, and about such property. McConnell v. Empire Tin Mining Co., 5 Alaska 506 (D. Alaska 1916).

       Statutes giving liens to laborers and mechanics are to be liberally construed. Southeastern Alaska Mining Corp. v. Zavodsky, 60 F.2d 24, 5 Alaska Fed. 672 (9th Cir. Alaska 1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       A statute of this kind should not be so strictly construed as statutes in general, certainly not so strictly construed as to deprive the general terms of the statute of any meaning that they may have consistent with the purpose of the act. Fremming v. Southeastern Alaska Mining Co., 8 Alaska 309 (D. Alaska 1931).

        Parts of statute on which existence of lien depends must be strictly construed. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The safe and proper rule of construction of mechanic’s lien statutes is that, while the remedial portions of these statutes should be liberally construed, with a view to avoid defeating the purpose of the statute, yet these parts upon which the right to the existence of the lien depend, being in derogation of the common law, should be strictly construed. Bergstrom v. Kugruk Mines, 10 Alaska 403 (D. Alaska 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Statutes must be substantially complied with. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This article providing for and authorizing foreclosure of mechanics’ liens should be liberally construed, but such liens, being of purely statutory creation, can be established only by a substantial compliance with the statute.

      </p>
      <p>
       This statute does not give a lien to superintendents and general managers.
   It expressly limits it to laborers and miners. Walbridge v. New York Alaska Gold Dredging Co., 8 Alaska 36 (D. Alaska 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       The services that an individual who is a superintendent and general manager performs are more in the nature of an executive officer, and he is entirely on a different footing from a person who is compelled to earn his daily bread by honest toil.

        Mining need not be in active progress. —

       This article, in no part of it, makes it a condition to the assertion of a lien that mining shall be in active progress. Southeastern Alaska Mining Corp. v. Zavodsky, 60 F.2d 24, 5 Alaska Fed. 672 (9th Cir. Alaska 1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       The development, operation, working, or mining of a mine or mining claim does not refer to work being done at any particular time, but refers equally well to any development, operation, working, or mining that might take place in the future, and the work of a watchman and caretaker may not only be convenient to such future development, operation, work, or mining, but may in many instances be necessary to it.

       A person who has taken possession of government land for the purpose of developing oil and is proceeding diligently to explore the land has such an interest therein as could be subjected to a mechanic’s lien under the law authorizing liens upon mining claims.

       When the legislature enacted its Mechanic’s Lien Law in favor of those working in or about oil wells, it intended to include in its definition of owner one who held a prospecting permit from the Secretary of the Interior under the Oil Leasing Act (41 Stat. 437).
   He is an owner of an interest in the land, and his interest therein is subject to a mechanic’s lien, without prejudice to the rights of the government.

      <p>
       The labor performed in sinking a shaft, running tunnels, and developing a mine prior to the time the dump was actually being piled up contributes more or less towards producing the dump, and the object of this section seems to be to give to each one performing labor upon the mine, while the mine is being developed and operated, a lien upon the dump produced.

      <p>
       Supervisory labor falls within the spirit of the activities meant to be protected; however, it does not include the labor of off-site payroll clerks, expeditors, or other general employees of the company since the work that these people perform may to a certain extent be necessary to the development of the mine but their work is peripheral to the physical mine itself and more akin to the standard overhead costs that any business incurs. D.H. Blattner &amp; Sons v. N.M. Rothschild &amp; Sons, Ltd., 55 P.3d 37 (Alaska 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supervisory charges must be restricted for purposes of a dump lien pursuant to this section to on-site services, but what counts geographically as being “on-site” requires some limited flexibility; thus, supervisory work need not be performed on the property legally owned by the owner of the mine but may also include work performed on land that is adjacent to the site of the mine, especially where convenient for the development of the mine.

       Because a corporation is considered a person under this section, equipment costs must be internalized into the labor that the corporation provides for purposes of a lien on a dump or mass of mineral.

      <p>
       Equipment costs that may be included within the amount due the laborer under subsection (a) of this section include those expenses for supplies, such as food and fuel, necessary to the maintenance of the worksite and not incorporated into the contracted-for project, since without the necessary supplies, neither the human workers nor the heavy equipment could function properly; the cost of supplies is therefore an integral part of the amount due the laborer under subsection (a) of this section and, as such, can be included in a dump lien, but the inclusion of supplies in a dump lien does not extend to materials, defined as those items and resources incorporated into the construction of the mine or well itself, or any surrounding buildings.

        “Dump” distinguished from “tailings”. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “dump” usually refers to the pile or mass of goldbearing earth or gravel hoisted from a mine, prior to the time that it has been washed and the gold and gold dust extracted therefrom, and the term “tailings” or “tailing pile” usually refers to the pile or mass of earth or gravel that has been washed or sluiced, and from which the gold and gold dust has been extracted. Donaldson v. Henning, 4 Alaska 642 (D. Alaska 1913).

        “Dump” or “mass” does not refer to natural gas remaining in place. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Although plaintiff had a valid, perfected lien against debtor's natural gas mine, including the natural gas remaining in place, it could not establish a priming dump lien in the natural gas remaining in the wells superior to a creditor's secured interests because it failed to show that a dump or mass existed.

       The legislature intended by subsection (a)(1) of this section to refer only to sands, earth, ore, rock, and minerals which were either deposited in dumps or piles, placed in hoppers or tanks or in sluice boxes or bunkers, or other receptacles, located in the same place.

      </p>
      <p>
       A mineral dump lien may extend only to gas extracted from its natural reservoir;, the lien may cover produced gas contained in a pipeline if certain conditions are met, and to obtain a dump lien laborers had to demonstrate that their work aided, broadly, in gas production. All Am. Oilfield, LLC v. Cook Inlet Energy, LLC, 446 P.3d 767 (Alaska 2019), overruled in part, Buntin v. Schlumberger Tech. Corp., 487 P.3d 595 (Alaska 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       Answer to the certified question, whether oil and gas well operator created a dump each time it released gas into its pipelines, was left to the trier of fact, but gas in a pipeline could be considered a dump if adjacent to the mine or mining claim. All Am. Oilfield, LLC v. Cook Inlet Energy, LLC, 446 P.3d 767 (Alaska 2019), overruled in part, Buntin v. Schlumberger Tech. Corp., 487 P.3d 595 (Alaska 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       Produced gas has to be the product of the lienor's labor, as defined in the dump and mine lien statutes. All Am. Oilfield, LLC v. Cook Inlet Energy, LLC, 446 P.3d 767 (Alaska 2019), overruled in part, Buntin v. Schlumberger Tech. Corp., 487 P.3d 595 (Alaska 2021).

Water in a geothermal well is an inorganic substance subject to acquisition under the laws of Alaska; the water in the geothermal well was a mineral within the context of the mining lien statutes.

      <p>
       <b>
        Liberal construction. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Attorney’s lien statutes are to be regarded as remedial and should be liberally construed in aid of the object sought by the legislature, which is to furnish security to attorneys for their efforts by giving them a lien upon the subject of the action. Phillips v. Jones, 355 P.2d 166 (Alaska 1960).

       <b>
        Recordation and duration of lien. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike several other statutory lien provisions, this section, the attorney’s lien statute, does not provide for the recordation of the lien; even in instances where a statutory lien may be recorded against specific property, the lien remains a charge on such property only for a limited period of time, typically six months, unless a civil action to foreclose the lien is timely filed; the statutory lien, alone, cannot encumber the affected property indefinitely. Rodvik v. Meddleton (In re Rodvik), 367 B.R. 148 (Bankr. D. Alaska 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       The attorney’s lien statute does not provide for the recordation of this type of lien, and the recorded notice of lien was invalid as a lien against debtor’s home. Rodvik v. Meddleton (In re Rodvik), 367 B.R. 148 (Bankr. D. Alaska 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        An attorney’s lien can only attach to property of the client;

       here, the client was a constructive trustee and not the owner of the insurance claim when the lien was perfected. McKnight v. Rice, Hoppner, Brown &amp; Brunner, 678 P.2d 1330 (Alaska 1984).

        Child support. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case in which an ex-wife’s attorney filed an attorney’s lien on money in the ex-husband’s possession that the attorney claimed was owed to his client, the Supreme Court concluded that the attorney’s lien satisfied the requirements of
   subsection (a)(3) of this section. Because no order or statute required that the ex-husband pay the money to the Child Support Services Division (CSSD) directly, the money was not in CSSD’s hands, even constructively, and it was subject to the attorney’s lien.

        Time limits for perfection. —

       <b>
        Attorney lien priority in multiple-party cases. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       For the purposes of attorney lien priority under subsection (b) of this section, each judgment between each set of parties in a multiple-party case should be treated as if it arose in a separate action or proceeding.
   Falconer v. Adams, 20 P.3d 583 (Alaska 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff sued Defendant A and Defendant B because of a motor vehicle accident and obtained a verdict against Defendant A, but Defendant B was exonerated and awarded attorney’s fees and costs. Plaintiff’s attorney, who had a lien on plaintiff’s judgment against Defendant A, had priority to the judgment proceeds over Defendant B because Defendant B was not a party to plaintiff’s judgment against Defendant A and subsection (b) of this section did not apply to Defendant B. Falconer v. Adams, 20 P.3d 583 (Alaska 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The first two subdivisions of this section are in the nature of retaining liens,
       </b>
       and depend upon possession. In re Winston's Lien, 6 Alaska 482 (D. Alaska 1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Retention of a judgment cannot in and of itself be the basis of a retaining lien
       </b>
       since the claimants only retain a copy of the judgment, with the original remaining on file with the superior court. In re Sea Catch, Inc., 36 B.R. 226 (Bankr. D. Alaska 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Enforceability of retaining lien. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a)(1) of this section only gives the attorney a retaining lien; the attorney may hold papers as security, but, unless the client initiates a contempt proceeding, he may not act to enforce the lien in a judicial proceeding. In re Sea Catch, Inc., 36 B.R. 226 (Bankr. D. Alaska 1983).

       <b>
        Co-counsel’s retaining lien supported inter-pleader. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Co-counsel’s lien for legal fees owed, asserted against client’s funds in possession of co-counsel, to which client also asserted a claim as a party to settlement, was sufficiently colorable to support interpleader. Noey v. Bledsoe, 978 P.2d 1264 (Alaska 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Delivery of papers on which lien held. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In cases where the attorney did not himself terminate the relation, the client cannot compel his attorney, or former attorney, to deliver up papers or documents on which the attorney has a retaining lien, unless he pays the amount due the attorney, or furnishes adequate security for the payment of what may be due or subsequently found to be due him. Miller v. Paul, 615 P.2d 615 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Adequacy of security imposed as condition of making order under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.ak.code.title.22.html#t22c20a02s22.20.080" target="_blank">22.20.080</a></cite> when lien claimed under this section. —
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining what constitutes adequate security for relinquishment, the trial court should consider a number of factors and set forth the basis for the decision. Miller v. Paul, 615 P.2d 615 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Factors to be weighed in determining what security, if any, should be required for release of files should include, among others (a) whether there was just cause for discharging the attorney; (b) whether the attorney initiated the withdrawal; (c) the client’s ability to provide security or to pay the fee; (d) the importance of the files to the client; (e) the ethical obligations of an attorney; (f) whether the fee is disputed, and, if so, the reasonable amount of any lien to be charged; (g) whether the amount due the attorney is contingent or fixed; (h) whether part of the sum due is for costs advanced by the attorney which may justify reimbursement before ordering release of the files. Miller v. Paul, 615 P.2d 615 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       A trial court may exercise its discretion in determining whether it is just to require a client’s home to be encumbered as a condition for release of an attorney’s files under certain circumstances.
   However, only in an extreme case would the requirement of encumbering a home be justified.
   Under statute, the Alaska legislature has, with certain exceptions, exempted homesteads from judicial sale, evincing a policy in favor of preserving rights to a homestead. Miller v. Paul, 615 P.2d 615 (Alaska 1980).

        Perfection of liens against bankruptcy trustee. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Without possession on the date of the filing of the petition of bankruptcy, a lien under subsection (a)(2) of this section does not exist and, therefore, is not perfected against the bankruptcy trustee with regard to prepetition services.

      </p>

       The third and fourth subdivisions (now subsections (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section) provide for the particular or charging liens.

       The lien is not valid until the required notice has been given as required by subdivision (3) (now subsection (a)(3) of this section).

       The legislature has not seen fit to define the term money as used in this section or elsewhere. This is interpreted to mean that it was not intended to limit the word to any narrow or restricted sense such as coin, currency, or legal tender, and a check drawn by the defendant in favor of the plaintiff, as the cash settlement portion of a settlement agreement which resulted in the termination of a lawsuit between the parties, constitutes money in the hands of the adverse party.

      <p>
       When some defendants settle a plaintiff’s claims against them, the plaintiff’s attorneys have a lien on settlement proceeds still in the attorney’s possession at the close of a trial against a defendant who does not settle. If the defendant who did not settle prevails at trial, it is not entitled to privity under subsection (b), because it was not a party to the pretrial settlement, and this section is properly interpreted to apply only to the parties actually involved in each settlement.

P. 82 where the trial court did not enter a decree for the hospital on a lien issue; even if this section had applied, the superior court would have been justified in denying the request because the hospital failed to file a properly-supported Alaska R.

       Under the common law, a transfer by an insolvent debtor to pay or to secure an antecedent debt has never been treated as a transfer to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, although it is self-evident that other creditors are necessarily hindered and delayed by such a transfer. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       At common law it was not illegal for a debtor to pay one of his creditors in full, even though he did not have enough left to pay his other creditors in full or even in part.
   Such a payment was not, and is not now, a fraudulent conveyance.
   The payment is merely the performance of an existing legal duty. Nor is it illegal for the debtor to transfer property as security for an existing debt; the value of the property in excess of the debt remains available to other creditors.
   The conveyance of property to a creditor in satisfaction of an existing debt is a fraudulent conveyance only in case its value is in excess of the debt and the purpose of the debtor is to keep that excess out of the hands of his other creditors. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971).

   and AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c40s34.40.090" target="_self">34.40.090</a></cite> by erecting a prima facie presumption of fraud in cases where a sale of personal property is not “accompanied by the immediate delivery and the actual and continued possession” by the vendee. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the creditor offered a satisfactory explanation for his failure to take more overt steps in attempting to reestablish possession of a vessel, and where he further showed that the quitclaim deed delivered by the debtor was issued in exchange for valuable consideration, the trial court was unjustified in relying on the statutory presumption to invalidate as fraudulent the conveyance in question.
   Under these circumstances, the trial court should have considered the validity of the transaction as a question of fact pursuant to this section and AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c40s34.40.090" target="_self">34.40.090</a></cite>. Accordingly, the court should have ruled on the issue whether, in the conveyance of the vessel to the creditor, there was an actual, as opposed to a presumed intent to hinder, delay, or defraud other creditors. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The badges of fraud here are as clearly apparent as they are multitudinous.
       </b>
       The compelling ones in terms of long-recognized indicia of fraud are: (1) The consideration is inadequate. (2) The transfer of the property was in anticipation of a pending suit. (3) The transferor debtor was insolvent. (4) There was a failure to record the instrument within a reasonable length of time. (5) The conveyance was a transfer of all or substantially all the debtor’s property. (6) The retention of possession of the premises by the grantor from the date of the execution of the deed stands unexplained. (7) The transfer so completely depleted the assets of the debtor that his creditor, the plaintiff, has thereby been hindered and delayed in recovering any part of his judgment. (8) The relationship of the parties becomes an additional badge of fraud when there also appear other circumstances which of themselves incite distrust and suspicion. First Nat'l Bank v. Enzler, 537 P.2d 517 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a conveyance is alleged to have been made fraudulently, the court may consider whether the disparity between the true value and the price paid is so great as to shock the conscience and strike the understanding at once with the conviction that such transfer never could have been made in good faith. Gransbury v. United Bldg. Supply, 531 P.2d 1247 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Badges of fraud at most are only evidentiary facts
       </b>
       tending to prove the ultimate fact, which is that fraud was intended. Matheson v. Patenaude, 8 Alaska 238 (D. Alaska 1930); Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Badges of fraud must be viewed within the context of each particular case, and, where their presence is satisfactorily accounted for, or where their existence is not inconsistent with a construction of the transaction as a valid one, they deserve to be accorded little weight. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971); First Nat'l Bank v. Enzler, 537 P.2d 517 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the totality of the circumstances surrounding a transaction has failed to indicate fraud, or where a strong showing of good faith in a transaction has been made, courts have frequently discounted the significance of badges of fraud as indicia of the character of the transaction. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971).

       When fraud has been established as to one creditor, it has not the effect to vitiate the conveyance as to all other creditors.
   The decree in such a suit merely avoids the conveyance as to the plaintiff therein, and as to all the other creditors it remains as though no proceedings had been taken. Ellis v. Reed, 238 F. 341, 4 Alaska Fed. 495 (9th Cir. Alaska 1917).

      </p>
      <p>
       Although the liability for a debt in the interim period before the collateral is sold at an execution sale is contingent in that it will only arise should the collateral sell for less than the amount owing, this fact does not preclude the present existence of a debt owed by the contingently liable party to the secured creditor.

        Distinction between transfer by contingent debtor and transfer by debtor anticipating suit. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the context of proving an intent to defraud creditors, there must be a distinction made between the transfer of property by a contingent debtor who, while aware of the possibility of owing a debt at some future time, reasonably concludes that that possibility will not arise, and the debtor who believes a suit is in the offing and who, in anticipation thereof, conveys property.
   The bona fide nature of the transfer in the former case is significantly less subject to suspicion than in the latter. First Nat'l Bank v. Enzler, 537 P.2d 517 (Alaska 1975).

      </p>
      <p>
       A preferential payment to one of several creditors by an insolvent debtor is not in itself an unlawful or fraudulent act. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of bankruptcy laws or express statutory prohibition, an insolvent debtor may convey property to one creditor, even if it means that the debtor’s assets will thereby be depleted, and the claims of other creditors will be defeated. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Barring the applicability of bankruptcy laws or similar statutory provisions insuring equal distribution of an insolvent debtor’s assets among all general creditors, there is nothing improper or unlawful about a preference being given to one creditor, even if it means that other creditors will be precluded from recovery. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>

       A bona fide preference of one creditor over others will be upheld even where the debtor is or will be rendered insolvent, or where other creditors are threatening suit, or where the preferred creditor is aware of the debtor’s insolvency.

      <p>
       Where the creditor offered a satisfactory explanation for his failure to take more overt steps in attempting to reestablish possession of a vessel, and where he further showed that the quitclaim deed delivered by the debtor was issued in exchange for valuable consideration, the trial court was unjustified in relying on the statutory presumption to invalidate as fraudulent the conveyance in question.
   Under these circumstances, the trial court should have considered the validity of the transaction as a question of fact pursuant to this section and AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c40s34.40.010" target="_self">34.40.010</a></cite>. Accordingly, the court should have ruled on the issue whether, in the conveyance of the vessel to the creditor, there was an actual, as opposed to a presumed intent to hinder, delay or defraud other creditors.

     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t34c40s34.40.110ol1a">
       A person who in writing transfers property in trust may provide that the interest of a beneficiary of the trust, including a beneficiary who is the settlor of the trust, may not be either voluntarily or involuntarily transferred before payment or delivery of the interest to the beneficiary by the trustee. Payment or delivery of the interest to the beneficiary does not include a beneficiary’s use or occupancy of real property or tangible personal property owned by the trust if the use or occupancy is in accordance with the trustee’s discretionary authority under the trust instrument. A provision in a trust instrument that provides the restrictions described in this subsection is considered to be a restriction that is a restriction on the transfer of the transferor’s beneficial interest in the trust and that is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. 541(c)(2) (Bankruptcy Code), as that paragraph reads on September 15, 2004, or as it may be amended in the future. In this subsection,
       <ol>

       If a trust contains a transfer restriction allowed under (a) of this section, the transfer restriction prevents a creditor existing when the trust is created or a person who subsequently becomes a creditor from satisfying a claim out of the beneficiary’s interest in the trust, unless the creditor is a creditor of the settlor and
       <ol>

        Chattel mortgage allowing mortgagor to treat property as own is void. —

      </p>
      <p>
       If a chattel mortgage is coupled with a condition or agreement that the mortgagor may treat the goods as if he were the owner of them, that is, may sell them at his option and receive the proceeds to his own use, such condition or agreement avoids the mortgage.
   In legal effect it is a sham, a nullity, a mere shadow of a mortgage, only calculated to ward off other creditors, and is a conveyance in trust for the benefit of the person making it, and therefore void as against creditors.

      <li id="t34c40s34.40.113ol1b">
       A discretionary interest in an irrevocable trust is not a property interest or an enforceable right. It is an expectancy that a creditor of a beneficiary may not attach or otherwise reach.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c40s34.40.113ol1c">
       A creditor of a beneficiary may not force a distribution with regard to a discretionary interest in an irrevocable trust. A creditor may not compel a trustee to exercise the trustee’s discretion to make a distribution with regard to a discretionary interest in an irrevocable trust.

      <li id="t34c40s34.40.113ol1d">
       Even if a beneficiary has an outstanding creditor, in the case of a discretionary interest in an irrevocable trust, a trustee who has the authority to pay income or principal to a beneficiary may pay it to a third party if the payment is for the benefit of the beneficiary. A trustee is not liable to a creditor for paying income or principal on behalf of the beneficiary.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c40s34.40.113ol1e">
       A creditor of a beneficiary may not maintain an action or a proceeding in court that interferes with the trustee’s discretion to apply income or principal on behalf of the beneficiary.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c40s34.40.113ol1f">
       A creditor of a beneficiary may not obtain an order of attachment or similar relief that would prevent a trustee from making a discretionary payment to a third party on behalf of the beneficiary.

       The fact that a developer received an exemption from the registration provisions of the federal Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act,
   15 U.S.C., §§ 1701 — 1720, and therefore is also exempt from the registration provisions of this chapter, does not immunize the developer from liability under this section.

        Liability of subdivider for damages caused by undetected permafrost. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A subdivider cannot be held liable for damages caused by undetected permafrost on either of two theories: (1) breach of an implied warranty of fitness or (2) strict liability. Stepanov v. Gavrilovich, 594 P.2d 30 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The liability of a subdivider depends, not upon the theories of strict liability or liability for breach of an implied warranty, but upon the failure to disclose permafrost conditions that are known to him or those that he could have known of through the exercise of reasonable care, i.e., the use of appropriate testing methods, review of available geologic data, etc. Stepanov v. Gavrilovich, 594 P.2d 30 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The presence of permafrost is an important “physical characteristic” and one of the “material circumstances or features affecting . . . subdivided land.” As such, the failure to disclose its existence in the public offering statement required by AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c55s34.55.008" target="_self">34.55.008</a></cite> and subsection (a) of this section can result in civil liability under the present statutory scheme.
   However, such liability does not attach under AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c55s34.55.030" target="_self">34.55.030</a></cite> if “the person offering or disposing of subdivided land did not know and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known of the . . . omission.” Stepanov v.

        Liability of subdivider for failure to disclose certain physical characteristics of land. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In enacting AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c55s34.55.004" target="_self">34.55.004</a></cite> — <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c55s34.55.046" target="_self">34.55.046</a></cite>, the legislature clearly intended to impose a system of controls on the activities of large-scale subdividers.
   One of those controls is civil liability when subdividers fail to disclose to a purchaser a physical characteristic of the subdivided land which adversely affects the usefulness of the land.
   But, when the condition is unknown to the subdivider, he is liable only if it is one that he could have learned of through the exercise of reasonable care. This standard also applies to subdividers operating before the statutory controls became effective and to small-tract subdividers who are still outside the provision of AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c55s34.55.004" target="_self">34.55.004</a></cite> — <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c55s34.55.046" target="_self">34.55.046</a></cite>.

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The presence of permafrost is an important physical characteristic and a material circumstance affecting subdivided land.
   As such, the failure to disclose its existence in the public offering statement required by AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c55s34.55.008" target="_self">34.55.008</a></cite> and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t34c55s34.55.012ol1a" target="_self">34.55.012(a)</a></cite> can result in civil liability under the present statutory scheme.
   However, such liability does not attach if “the person offering or disposing of subdivided land did not know and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known of the . . . omission.” Stepanov v. Gavrilovich, 594 P.2d 30 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The liability of a subdivider depends, not upon the theories of strict liability or liability for breach of an implied warranty, but upon the failure to disclose permafrost conditions that are known to him or those that he could have known of through the exercise of reasonable care, i.e., the use of appropriate testing methods, review of available geologic data, etc. Stepanov v.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A state agency or other entity acquiring real property for any project or program in which federal or federal-aid funds are used shall to the greatest extent practicable comply with the following policies:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t34c60s34.60.120ol11">
       Every reasonable effort shall be made to expeditiously acquire real property by negotiation.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c60s34.60.120ol12">
       Real property shall be appraised before the initiation of negotiations, and the owner or a designated representative shall be given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser during the inspection of the property.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c60s34.60.120ol13">
       Before the initiation of negotiations for real property, an amount shall be established that is reasonably believed to be just compensation for the real property and that amount shall be offered for the property. In no event may the amount be less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value of the property.  A decrease or increase in the fair market value of real property before the date of valuation caused by the public improvement for which the property is acquired or by the likelihood that the property would be acquired for the improvement, other than that due to physical deterioration within the reasonable control of the owner, will be disregarded in determining the compensation for the property. The owner of the real property to be acquired shall be provided with a written statement of, and a summary of the basis for, the amount established as just compensation.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c60s34.60.120ol14">
       An owner may not be required to surrender possession of real property before the state agency concerned pays the agreed purchase price or deposits with the court in accordance with applicable law, for the benefit of the owner, an amount not less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value of the property, or the amount of the award of compensation in the condemnation proceeding for the property.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c60s34.60.120ol15">
       The construction or development of a public improvement shall be so scheduled that, to the greatest extent practicable, a person lawfully occupying real property is not required to move from a dwelling, assuming a replacement dwelling will be available, or to move the person’s business or farm operation, without at least 90 days’ written notice of the date by which the move is required.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c60s34.60.120ol16">
       If an owner or tenant is permitted to occupy the real property acquired on a rental basis for a short term or for a period subject to termination by the state agency on short notice, the amount of rent required may not exceed the fair rental value of the property to a short-term occupier.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c60s34.60.120ol17">
       In no event may the time of condemnation be advanced or negotiations or condemnation and the deposit of funds in court for the use of the owner be deferred, nor any other coercive action be taken in order to compel an agreement on the price to be paid for the property.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c60s34.60.120ol18">
       If an interest in real property is to be acquired by exercise of the power of eminent domain, formal condemnation proceedings shall be instituted.  The acquiring state agency may not intentionally make it necessary for an owner to institute legal proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of the real property.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c60s34.60.120ol19">
       If the acquisition of only part of the property would leave its owner with an uneconomic remnant, an offer to acquire the entire property shall be made.

        Inclusion of value enhancement attributable to the project for which the property is being taken is generally prohibited
       </b>
       in determining condemnation awards in Alaska. This general rule is in accordance with the requirement in the Alaska and United States Constitutions that just compensation be paid for private property taken for public use, since it only prevents a landowner from receiving more value for his property than he would if the government had no use for his land and it was purchased by a private buyer.
   However, this rule does not preclude an owner from receiving compensation for value added to the property by an unrelated public project which took no portion of the tract involved. State v. Alaska Continental Dev. Corp., 630 P.2d 977 (Alaska 1980).

        An exception to the general prohibition
       </b>
       against awarding enhanced value from the project for which a parcel is taken occurs when the parcel was not properly within the scope of the original project but was included in a subsequent enlargement of the project.
   In those circumstances, a landowner should not be deprived of the value added in the meantime by the proximity of the improvement. State v. Alaska Continental Dev. Corp., 630 P.2d 977 (Alaska 1980).

      In addition to the other programs authorized by this chapter, the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation may make loans in order to encourage and facilitate the construction or rehabilitation of housing to meet the needs of displaced persons. These loans are a part of the federally assisted project cost and may be made to nonprofit, limited dividend, or cooperative organizations, or to public bodies. The loans may be made only for necessary and reasonable expenses, before construction, for planning and obtaining federally insured mortgage financing for the rehabilitation or construction of housing for displaced persons. The loans may not exceed 80 percent of the reasonable costs expected to be incurred in planning, and in obtaining financing for housing for displaced persons. Reasonable costs include but are not limited to costs for preliminary surveys and analysis of market needs, preliminary architectural fees, site acquisition, application and mortgage commitment fees, and construction loan fees and discounts. Loans to an organization established for profit shall bear interest at a market rate established by the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation. All other loans shall be without interest. The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation shall require repayment of loans made under this section under terms and conditions that it may prescribe. Repayment shall be made upon completion of the project or sooner, and except in the case of a loan to an organization established for profit, the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation may cancel any part or all of a loan if the corporation determines that a permanent loan to finance the rehabilitation or construction of the housing cannot be obtained in an amount adequate for repayment of the loan.

      Except as may otherwise be provided by federal law, a person may not bring a nuisance action otherwise allowed under this chapter for the level of noise against a facility unless the action is brought within five years after the facility is established or begins operation or, if the action is brought after a substantial change in the use of the facility, within three years after the substantial change. In this section, “established” includes resuming shooting activity at a sport shooting facility if there has not been shooting activity at the facility for three or more years, or resuming airport activity at a private airport facility if there has not been airport activity at the facility for three or more years.

       Intestate decedent’s husband was presumptively the sole owner of a boat and skiff, even though they were purchased during the marriage with marital funds, because the husband’s name alone was on the title to the boats and the related business. Because Alaska is not a community property state, title cannot be disregarded in determining which spouse owns property at death; there is a presumption that the person with title owns the property.

       An arrangement is a community property trust if one or both spouses transfer property to a trust, the trust expressly declares that some or all the property transferred is community property under this chapter, and at least one trustee is a qualified person whose powers include or are limited to maintaining records for the trust on an exclusive or a nonexclusive basis and preparing or arranging for the preparation of, on an exclusive or a nonexclusive basis, any income tax returns that must be filed by the trust. A community property trust is enforceable without consideration. Both spouses or either spouse may be a trustee. The trust must be signed by both spouses. In this subsection, “qualified person” means

       If the words “survivorship community property” are used instead of the words “community property” in the form described in (a) or (b) of this section, the community property is survivorship community property. On the death of a spouse, the ownership rights of that spouse in survivorship community property vest solely in the surviving spouse by nontestamentary disposition at death. The first deceased spouse does not have a right of disposition at death of any interest in survivorship community property. Holding community property in a form described in (a) or (b) of this section does not by itself establish survivorship ownership between the spouses for the property held in that form.
