    The provisions of this title were redrafted in 1988 to remove personal pronouns pursuant to § 4, ch. 58, SLA 1982 and in 1988, 1998, 2010, and 2018 to make other minor word changes.
   </p>
   <p>
    In 1977, “Department of Transportation and Public Facilities” was substituted for “Department of Public Works” in several sections to implement E.O. No. 39 § 11 (1977).

The terms, conditions, charges, rentals, and fees shall be established with due regard to the property and improvements used and the expense of operation to the state. A charge, rental, or fee imposed on a person who is not a lessee or concessionaire of the airport may not have the effect of charging a percentage of the gross revenue of the person as a condition of on-site access to customers who use the airport facility unless the charge, rental, or fee was in existence before January 1, 2006, and this exception is not affected if the department amends, increases, or decreases a charge, rental, or fee that was in effect before January 1, 2006. Use of state land and buildings by the Alaska Wing, Civil Air Patrol and its squadrons shall be permitted without rental charges. If the department permits space in state-owned or state-controlled airports to be used as lounges for members of the United States armed forces, the Alaska National Guard, the Alaska Naval Militia, or the Alaska State Defense Force, and if the lounges are operated by persons exempt from taxation under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) (Internal Revenue Code), rent may not be charged for the use of the space.

      A person may not erect or permit to grow an airport hazard on land adjacent to the end of a runway of a public airport without a permit issued by the department. The area upon which these hazards are prohibited is the width of the runway, and extends from the airport boundary at the end of the runway, away from the runway in a direction parallel to its centerline for a distance equal to the length of the runway. An obstruction situated in an area not previously designated as an airport hazard area by the department is not a hazard if its height does not exceed five feet for each 200 feet distance from the boundary of the airport. The vertical measurement of the structure starts on the same plane as the surface of the runway.

      , the department may adopt, administer, and enforce, under the police power and in the manner and upon the conditions prescribed in this chapter, airport zoning regulations for any airport within this state dividing the area surrounding the airport into zones. Within these zones, the department may specify the land uses permitted, and regulate and restrict the height to which structures and trees may be erected or allowed to grow, and require the abatement of lights, or electronic signals or emissions that may create a hazard to the operation of aircraft. In adopting or revising zoning regulations, the department shall consider, among other things, the character of the flying operations to be conducted at the airport, the nature of the terrain, the height of existing structures and trees above the level of the airport, the possibility of lowering or removing existing obstructions, and the views of the agency of the federal government charged with fostering civil aeronautics as to the aerial approaches necessary to safe flying operations at the airport.

     <p>
      Where advisable to facilitate the enforcement of zoning regulations adopted under this chapter, permits may be granted to establish or construct new structures and other uses and to replace existing structures and other uses or make substantial changes or substantial repairs. Before any nonconforming structure or tree may be replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher, or replanted, a permit must be secured from the department authorizing the replacement, change or repair. A permit may not be granted allowing the structure or tree to be made higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when the applicable regulation was adopted. If the department determines that a nonconforming structure or tree is abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, destroyed, deteriorated, or decayed, (1) a permit may not be granted allowing the structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limits or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations; and (2) whether application is made for a permit under this section or not, the department may, by appropriate action, compel the owner of the nonconforming structure or tree, at the owner’s own expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct, or equip the object to conform to the regulations. If the owner of the nonconforming structure or tree neglects or refuses to comply with the order within 10 days after notice, the department may proceed to have the object lowered, removed, reconstructed, or equipped, and the cost and expense is a lien upon the object and the land on which it is located. Unless the account is paid within 90 days from the service of notice on the agent or owner of the object or land, the sum bears interest at the rate of eight percent a year until paid, and shall be collected by foreclosure in the manner provided for the foreclosure of mortgages.
