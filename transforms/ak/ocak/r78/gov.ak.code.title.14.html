      A school district must permit a child who is temporarily hospitalized or attending a treatment facility in the district to enroll as a student in, and receive educational services from, the district. If the child is an exceptional child, the district must ordinarily provide special education and related services. If the child is placed within the district in accordance with an Individualized Education Plan developed by his or her home district, however, that district must make arrangements for the child’s education. August 12, 1987 Op. Att’y Gen.

      Under current laws, public schools may, but are not required to enroll private school students on a part time basis. June 24, 1993 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Alaska school districts are not prohibited from enrolling students on a part-time basis in public school courses, but are not required to do so.
      Private school students may be enrolled part time in public school classes subject to the same enrollment requirements as other students, and so long as the practice is not used by private schools on a widespread basis to provide the curriculum requirements of the private school.
      Enrollment in extracurricular activities is similarly neither prohibited nor required.

      <p>
       The importance of the educational and property interests involved in the closure of neighborhood schools in a school district requires adequate notice of the school board meeting at which the decision was made to close a specific school and five-day notice of the meeting is insufficient. Tunley v. Municipality of Anchorage Sch. Dist., 631 P.2d 67 (Alaska 1980), amended, — P.2d — (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       A five-day notice of which schools in a school district are subject to closure militates against appropriate preparation and poses serious obstacles to the presentation of persuasive, properly researched, and supported opposition to any closure plan.
       It also lessens the likelihood of a fair hearing before the school board and of the school board reaching a reasoned administrative decision. Tunley v. Municipality of Anchorage Sch. Dist., 631 P.2d 67 (Alaska 1980), amended, — P.2d — (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the critical importance of education to democratic society, the significant interests of the plaintiff as a taxpayer-owner of real property affected by the closure of the school nearest the plaintiff, and the important interests of both plaintiff’s child, and the plaintiff as a parent, in the educational considerations involved, the plaintiff has rights subject to procedural due process protection, which due process rights to notice and an opportunity to be heard are independent of the requirement under the city’s charter for an ordinance setting forth notice provisions for school board meetings. Tunley v. Municipality of Anchorage Sch. Dist., 631 P.2d 67 (Alaska 1980), amended, — P.2d — (Alaska 1981).

      Although public school teachers may teach about various religions as part of the curriculum in public schools, they may not advocate a particular religious view or teach that a particular religious view is true or false. The Professional Training Practices Commission has jurisdiction to hear complaints about the inappropriate advocacy of personal religious views in the classroom, and to take appropriate disciplinary action if the complaints are justified. Sept. 15, 1988 Op. Att’y Gen.

      The Department of Education and Early Development properly informed districts operating statewide correspondence study programs that they must require parents to use primary curriculum materials that are secular in nature, approved in advance by the school district; the enforcement action and current regulations do not infringe upon the rights of parents and are consistent with the underlying statutes. Correspondence school students may not use religious materials in lieu of district approved textbooks and materials, but parents may privately supplement their child’s educational material with religious materials.

      A book may not be approved for use in publicly provided education if it advocates a partisan, sectarian, or denominational doctrine.

     , does not apply to noncertificated employees of school districts, there is no statute which imposes a duty to bargain on the regional educational attendance areas and the regional educational attendance areas therefore have no statutory duty to bargain with a bargaining representative of the noncertificated employees.

      Collective bargaining agreement with predecessor did not bind REAAs. —

    </p>
    <p>
     Collective bargaining agreement entered into between the state and a public service council, which agreement included within the bargaining unit the noncertificated employees of the regional educational attendance areas’ predecessor, the Alaska State-Operated School System, which was disbanded pursuant to the same act creating the regional educational attendance areas, did not bind the regional educational attendance areas, which did not assume the agreement, either as successor employers or by § 40, ch. 124, SLA 1975, which provides in part, “All contracts or other obligations created by a law amended by this Act or by virtue of functions which may be transferred by this Act, and in effect on the effective date of this Act, remain in effect unless revoked or modified under the provisions of this Act.” Northwest Arctic Regional Educ. Attendance Area v. Alaska Pub. Serv. Employees, 591 P.2d 1292 (Alaska 1979), overruled, Alaska Commercial Fishing &amp; Agric. Bank v. O/S Alaska Coast, 715 P.2d 707 (Alaska 1986).
    </p>
    <p>
     Implicit in the termination of the noncertificated employees in § 41 (b), ch. 124, SLA 1975, is the intention not to bind the Alaska State-Operated School System’s successor to existing employment contracts.
     This interpretation conforms with § 41 (a) of ch. 124, which specifically carries teachers over to the new employer with their accumulated employee contract benefits.
     No such provision was made for noncertificated personnel. Northwest Arctic Regional Educ. Attendance Area v. Alaska Pub. Serv. Employees, 591 P.2d 1292 (Alaska 1979), overruled, Alaska Commercial Fishing &amp; Agric. Bank v. O/S Alaska Coast, 715 P.2d 707 (Alaska 1986).

       Interpreting "bond" to refer to bonds as a whole, instead of only the school debt portion, is consistent with the statute and is reasonable based on the department's expertise; that "bond" refers to the bond itself, and not a subcomponent of the bond, is also the most natural reading of the statute, and treating bonds as a whole is crucial to the department's process of verifying a municipality's payment information. North Slope Borough v. State, 484 P.3d 106 (Alaska 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       Department's interpretation of the statute's requirement that equal payment terms for the bonds are required ensures that the payment verification process is accurate and not susceptible to unexpected changes, and the department's determination that the bonds in this case did not comply with statutory requirements was supported by the language of the statute and had a reasonable basis in law.

       Interpretation of the statute implicates agency expertise and policy considerations that fall within the scope of the agency's statutory functions; applying the reasonable basis standard of review to the department's interpretation of the statute is therefore appropriate.

       Prior department employee acknowledged that he failed to apply and interpret the statute correctly when he recommended reimbursement for the borough's previous bonds, but his failure to abide by applicable law did not constitute a regulation, and the department's current interpretation corrected a previous oversight; the department was not required to comply with notice and comment provisions before determining that the borough's bonds did not comply with statutory requirements.

       If the department were equitably estopped from correcting its former employee's failure to apply the statute, it would be prevented from denying reimbursement requests that contravened the statute and the legislative intent behind the statute, and thus the hearing officer rightfully rejected the borough's equitable estoppel claim.

       Superior court did not abuse its discretion by denying the borough's request for a trial de novo; there was no dispute that the five bonds did not comply with the statute as the education department interpreted it, and the record at the administrative hearing provided an adequate basis for the hearing officer's decision.

       Required local contribution was constitutional because the existing funding formula did not violate the dedicated funds clause, the appropriations clause, or the governor’s veto where the minutes of the constitutional convention and the historical context of those proceedings revealed that the delegates did not intend for required local contributions to be a state tax or license, the local contribution never entered the state treasury.

      <p>
       Since pupil assignment and attendance area determinations may be made by a school board as a part of its “management and control” authority pursuant to this section, subject to statutory and constitutional restrictions, this assignment power extended to its logical conclusion — the closing of a school by not assigning any students to the particular school — provides a basis for the school board’s authority to close schools.

      </p>
      <p>
       Given the broad managerial mandate of the school board, and the limited authority of the municipal assembly in educational policy matters, it is the school board which has the authority to decide whether schools should be closed.

      <p>
       Section 4 AAC 05.090, which requires state approval prior to discontinuation of predominantly local schools established pursuant to the regulatory chapter of which this regulation is a part, does not require state department of education approval of that closure action by the Anchorage school board.

      </p>
      <p>
       The importance of the educational and property interests involved in the closure of neighborhood schools in a school district requires adequate notice of the school board meeting at which the decision was made to close a specific school and five-day notice of the meeting is insufficient. Tunley v. Municipality of Anchorage Sch. Dist., 631 P.2d 67 (Alaska 1980), amended, — P.2d — (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       A five-day notice of which schools in a school district are subject to closure militates against appropriate preparation and poses serious obstacles to the presentation of persuasive, properly researched, and supported opposition to any closure plan.
       It also lessens the likelihood of a fair hearing before the school board and of the school board reaching a reasoned administrative decision. Tunley v. Municipality of Anchorage Sch. Dist., 631 P.2d 67 (Alaska 1980), amended, — P.2d — (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the critical importance of education to democratic society, the significant interests of the plaintiff as a taxpayer-owner of real property affected by the closure of the school nearest the plaintiff, and the important interests of both plaintiff’s child, and the plaintiff as a parent, in the educational considerations involved, the plaintiff has rights subject to procedural due process protection, which due process rights to notice and an opportunity to be heard are independent of the requirement under the city’s charter for an ordinance setting forth notice provisions for school board meetings. Tunley v. Municipality of Anchorage Sch. Dist., 631 P.2d 67 (Alaska 1980), amended, — P.2d — (Alaska 1981).

     Southeast Regional Resource Center (SERRC) is neither a local educational agency nor an intermediate educational agency. It cannot serve as the fiscal agent for a consortium of districts under the Eisenhower Math and Science Program. A change in SERRC’s status to imbue it with more governmental connection or authority would represent a significant change requiring legislative action. The department should give careful consideration to the policy and legal implications before supporting such a change. July 20, 1995, Op. Att’y Gen.

       , subject to statutory and constitutional restrictions, this assignment power extended to its logical conclusion — the closing of a school by not assigning any students to the particular school — provides a basis for the school board’s authority to close schools.

      </p>
      <p>
       Given the broad managerial mandate of the school board, and the limited authority of the municipal assembly in educational policy matters, it is the school board which has the authority to decide whether schools should be closed. Tunley v. Municipality of Anchorage Sch. Dist., 631 P.2d 67 (Alaska 1980), amended, — P.2d — (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The closure of a school does not involve the exercise of a municipality’s eminent domain powers, nor does it involve major additional appropriations of municipal funds. Furthermore, in contrast to the municipal government’s diminished fiscal and political interests, a school board has strong educational policy interests in deciding which schools are to be closed, which decision effectively determines the size, the design, and therefore the nature of the educational programs of the schools which remain open.

      The 50 percent discount allowed in (c) of this section applies to an increase in a district’s assessment on account of the annexation of additional territory.
      Therefore, the Department of Community and Economic Development should treat increases in the municipal tax base caused by annexation the same as it treats increases caused by appreciation.

        Purpose of tenure laws. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Tenure laws are intended to give job security to experienced teachers and to ensure that they will not be discharged for inadequate reasons. State v. Redman, 491 P.2d 157 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       A system of tenure has as its objective the retention of able personnel after they have undergone an adequate period of probation with the concomitant result that more talented personnel will be attracted to enter the teaching profession. State v. Redman, 491 P.2d 157 (Alaska 1971).

      <p>
       <b>
        The law does not require that teachers shall teach every day,
       </b>
       or every hour of every day. State v. Redman, 491 P.2d 157 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no provision of Alaska statutes concerning education which requires, and no persuasive policy reasons why, a teacher must work full days throughout the school year in order to attain tenure rights.
       No legislative intent to exclude a teacher who works less than full days is manifest from a study of the applicable statutes. State v. Redman, 491 P.2d 157 (Alaska 1971).

       4 AAC 19.010, which provides that formal evaluations shall serve as a method for gathering data relevant to subsequent employment status decisions pertaining to the person evaluated, cannot operate to limit the broad discretion that was intentionally given to local school boards by the legislature, and a school board’s decision not to renew the contract of a nontenured teacher may be “for any cause which the employer determines to be adequate.” Shatting v. Dillingham City Sch. Dist., 617 P.2d 9 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the broad language of subsection (a), the board’s discretion is subject to certain limitations; for example, a school board may not deny continued employment to a teacher because of the teacher’s exercise of first amendment rights, nor may a school board deny continued employment to a teacher if to do so would deprive the teacher of other rights that are guaranteed by constitution or statute.

      <p>
       Where a mid-year dismissal is at issue, clearly the teachers have been deprived of an interest in property, namely, their present teaching post.
       This is an interest protected by the 14th amendment to the United States Constitution and by the first article of the Alaska Constitution, and thus they are entitled to a hearing. Nichols v. Eckert, 504 P.2d 1359 (Alaska 1973).

       The “notification of dismissal” is a notice that the board has voted in favor of dismissal, but the dismissal cannot be effective until the teacher has had an opportunity to request a hearing if one is desired. Kenai Peninsula Borough Bd. of Educ. v. Brown, 691 P.2d 1034 (Alaska 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this section gives the teacher 15 days in which to request a hearing, the termination is not effective until at least 15 days following the notification of dismissal. Kenai Peninsula Borough Bd. of Educ. v. Brown, 691 P.2d 1034 (Alaska 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the teacher does not request a hearing, the dismissal becomes effective immediately following the expiration of the 15 day period; if the teacher does request a hearing, the dismissal can only be effective after a final majority vote following the hearing. Kenai Peninsula Borough Bd. of Educ. v. Brown, 691 P.2d 1034 (Alaska 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Meeting resulted in a dismissal prior to a hearing in violation of teacher’s due process rights where the teacher was notified that the Board of Education had approved a recommendation for his immediate dismissal and that his pay was terminated effective the day of the meeting, and he was told that he could request a hearing, but the dismissal was nonetheless effective prior to the hearing.

      <p>
       In light of the provision in subsection (c) (now (d)) of this section that the final decision of the school board must be “written and contain specific findings of fact and conclusions of law,” the time for appeal from the board’s determination did not begin to run until the written decision was mailed or delivered to the teacher.

      <p>
       A policy factor militating in favor of a full application of this section
       
       is that a tenured teacher against whose favor a decision has been reached is faced with the loss of a very important right: his source of income.
       In this connection, it is not necessary to indulge in such classificatory labels as “vested right” or “property right,” for it is enough that the right be recognized as important for it to act as a guide to decision in the interpretation of this section.

      <p>
       The superior court erred in making the teacher choose between a de novo trial and an appellate review of the record. The statute provides tenured teachers the right to a de novo trial, and makes no mention of other available levels of review. Further, the de novo requirement is not satisfied by a de novo mere review on the evidence presented in the administrative hearing. Linstad v. Sitka Sch. Dist., 863 P.2d 838 (Alaska 1993) (decided under former AS

       Probationary employees who are otherwise lawfully discharged cannot obtain permanent status through grievance procedures

      <p>
       The grievance procedure may be of value to a nontenured teacher
       
       in attempting to persuade the hiring authority that he should be retained.
       The process might on occasion bring forth evidence and argument by which the termination of the nontenured teacher might be reconsidered. Van Gorder v. Matanuska-Susitna Borough Sch. Dist., 513 P.2d 1094 (Alaska 1973) (decided under former AS

       While this section does not extend the tenured teacher’s right to a trial de novo to a nontenured teacher, neither does it preclude a more limited form of judicial review of the school board decision; therefore a nontenured teacher has a right to judicial review, on the record, of a school board’s nonretention, and although a review on the record is all that is required, in its discretion the superior court may grant a trial de novo.

        The states party to this agreement, desiring by common action to improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education, and of the teaching profession. It is the purpose of this agreement to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the states party to it, and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end.
       </li>
       <li id="t14c20a06s14.20.630-Iol12">
        The party states find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations. Variations from state to state in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other states. As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems. Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their states of origin, can increase the available educational resources.  Participation in this compact can increase the availability of educational manpower.

    <p>
     In general, a person’s right to benefits under the state’s public employee retirement systems vests when the person joins the system. Hammond v. Hoffbeck, 627 P.2d 1052 (Alaska 1981). Therefore, former law may govern the benefits of some members of the teachers’ retirement system. The user is advised to ascertain which version of a particular statute is applicable. Earlier versions of the statutes can be found in prior editions of the Alaska Statutes or in the published Session Laws of Alaska.

    <p>
     There is a strong probability that the Alaska courts would find a diversion of retirement funds for other purposes to be violative of the Alaska constitution and would in addition find the governor bound by statute to include employer contributions in his budget. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that any budget submitted by the governor contain the prescribed funds. December 2, 1992 Op. Att’y Gen.

To obtain this credited service, the person shall claim the service and verify the period of half-time employment. When eligibility for half-time service credit has been established, an indebtedness shall be determined to the retirement plan in which the person did not participate. The amount of the indebtedness is the full actuarial cost of providing benefits for the credited service claimed. Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues on that indebtedness beginning on the later of July 1, 1989, or the date on which the member is first eligible to claim the service. Any outstanding indebtedness existing at the time the person retires will require an actuarial adjustment to the benefits payable based on that service.

      In general, a person’s right to benefits under the state’s public employee retirement systems vests when the person joins the system. Hammond v. Hoffbeck, 627 P.2d 1052 (Alaska 1981). Therefore, former law may govern the benefits of some members of the teachers’ retirement system. The user is advised to ascertain which version of the statute is applicable. Earlier versions of the statutes can be found in prior editions of the Alaska Statutes or in the published Session Laws of Alaska.

      A teacher satisfies the requirement of subsection (a) by working any five creditable years or combination of fractional years totalling 5 years, as long as they are the last 5 years she worked and they are in membership service. 1966 Op. Att’y Gen. No. 2, issued prior to the 1975 amendment.

      In general, a person’s right to benefits under the state’s public employee retirement systems vests when the person joins the system. Hammond v. Hoffbeck, 627 P.2d 1052 (Alaska 1981). Therefore, former law may govern the benefits of some members of the teachers’ retirement system. The user is advised to ascertain which version of the statute is applicable. Earlier versions of the statutes can be found in prior editions of the Alaska Statutes or in the published Session Laws of Alaska.

      Regulation 2 AAC 36.210 is consistent with this statute. However, we also understand that the Teachers’ Retirement System (TRS) has, prior to the adoption of the regulation, paid the COLA to benefit recipients whom TRS considered to be residents but who would not have met the 93/183 days test. In light of that, we conclude that the regulation should only be applied to those joining TRS after its adoption. March 15, 1995 Op. Att’y Gen.

      In general, a person’s right to benefits under the state’s public employee retirement systems vests when the person joins the system. Hammond v. Hoffbeck, 627 P.2d 1052 (Alaska 1981). Therefore, former law may govern the benefits of some members of the teachers’ retirement system. The user is advised to ascertain which version of a particular statute is applicable. The version of this statute that was in effect immediately after the 1980 amendments read as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Sec. 14.25.143. POST RETIREMENT PENSION ADJUSTMENT. (a) When the administrator determines that the cost of living has increased and that the financial condition of the retirement fund permits, the administrator shall increase benefit payments to persons receiving benefits under this system.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(b) The amount of the increase in benefit payments may not exceed the greater of
     </p>
     <p>
      “(1) the increase in the cost of living since the date of retirement; or
     </p>
     <p>
      “(2) four percent of the retirement benefit compounded for each year of retirement.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(c) The administrator shall implement this section by regulation.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(d) A person receiving benefits under this chapter shall be granted a 10 percent increase in the current base benefit if the person was receiving benefits on July 1, 1976. The increase shall be effective July 1, 1977.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(e) If at the time of first receiving a retirement benefit a member was receiving a disability benefit, the administrator shall include the time during which the member received the disability benefit in determining the number of years of retirement under this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(f) An increase in benefit payments under this section is effective July 1 of the year for which the increase in granted.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 48, ch. 146, SLA 1980 provides: “The retirement benefit payable to a member of the teachers’ retirement system who is receiving a normal retirement benefit under AS

      on July 1, 1980, and who at the time of his retirement was receiving a disability benefit under the teachers’ retirement system, shall be increased by a percentage equal to the percentage of all post-retirement pension adjustments payable under AS

     </p>
     <p>
      Under §§ 18 and 19, ch. 9, FSSLA 2005, following amendment by sec. 3, ch. 146, SLA 1980, and until amended by sec. 12, ch. 97, SLA 1990, (a) of this section read: “(a) When the administrator determines that the cost of living has increased and that the financial condition of the retirement fund permits, the administrator shall increase benefit payments to persons receiving benefits under this plan. For purposes of this subsection, the financial condition of the fund would only permit an increase in benefits when the ratio of total fund assets to the accrued liability meets or exceeds 105 percent. In this subsection, “accrued liability” means the present value of all member benefits accrued by member service in this plan.”

     <p>
      If the financial condition of the funds does not permit payment of the PRPA, it is allowable to prospectively not pay existing members new [or additional] ad hoc PRPAs.
      However, a new statutory provision cannot reduce the existing number of members who retain a vested right to a PRPA if one is awarded, unless the new statutory provision includes comparable enhancements to benefits.
      April 20, 2005 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Legislation that limits the administrator’s discretion and allows an award of an ad hoc PRPA only if a retirement fund is actuarially funded at over 100 percent and employer contribution rates are set at less than eight percent would be subject to challenge under existing case law.
      The constitutional rights of members regarding the ad hoc PRPA include the right to consideration of an award of a PRPA based on the discretion existing under the repealed statutes.

      In general, a person’s right to benefits under the state’s public employee retirement systems vests when the person joins the system. Hammond v. Hoffbeck, 627 P.2d 1052 (Alaska 1981). Therefore, former law may govern the benefits of some members of the teachers’ retirement system. The user is advised to ascertain which version of the statute is applicable.

      In general, a person’s right to benefits under the state’s public employee retirement systems vests when the person joins the system. Hammond v. Hoffbeck, 627 P.2d 1052 (Alaska 1981). Therefore, former law may govern the benefits of some members of the teachers’ retirement system. The user is advised to ascertain which version of the statute is applicable. Earlier versions of the statutes can be found in prior editions of the Alaska Statutes or in the published Session Laws of Alaska.

      Pre-funding of the medical component of PERS and TRS benefits, to the extent that pre-funding would be considered an accrued benefit, may not be discontinued for members who were employed during the period that statutes required pre-funding.

      Health benefits provided by the state’s retirement system statutes are part of the retirement benefit package that becomes part of the contract of employment when the public employee is hired.

      In general, a person’s right to benefits under the state’s public employee retirement systems vests when the person joins the system. Hammond v. Hoffbeck, 627 P.2d 1052 (Alaska 1981). Therefore, former law may govern the benefits of some members of the teachers’ retirement system. The user is advised to ascertain which version of a particular statute is applicable. Earlier versions of the statutes can be found in prior editions of the Alaska Statutes or in the published Session Laws of Alaska.

      In general, a person’s right to benefits under the state’s public employee retirement systems vests when the person joins the system. Hammond v. Hoffbeck, 627 P.2d 1052 (Alaska 1981). Therefore, former law may govern the benefits of some members of the teachers’ retirement system. The user is advised to ascertain which version of the statute is applicable. Earlier versions of the statutes can be found in prior editions of the Alaska Statutes or in the published Session Laws of Alaska.

       In an action under 20 U.S.C.S. § 1415(i) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C.S. § 1400 et seq., the district court determined that a hearing officer equitably applied the federal two-year statute of limitations rather than the 12-month statute of limitations under this section because the parents of a disabled student were never formally informed of the 12-month limitations period.

       As a constitutional corporation, owing its existence not to the legislature but to a charter from the ultimate sovereign, the will of the people of this state, the basic corporate power to sue and be sued in its own name would inhere in the University of Alaska regardless of the legislature’s declaration in this section.

       Neither the University’s unique corporate character nor its power to sue and be sued in its own name detracted in any degree from what the supreme court considered most significant and controlling in a case to determine whether the University is an instrumentality of the state: that the University, in performing its constitutional functions, acts for the benefit of the state and of the public generally in the process of government; and that it was created to pursue the governmental task of providing education in accordance with an express mandate of the constitution, the fundamental and basic government of this state.

      Impeachment is an option that may be pursued in order to remove a regent; however, it is not the only option. The Alaska Constitutional Convention intended to insulate the University from politics, including the governor, intended that the University would not be subject to section 26 of Article III of the Alaska Constitution, and intended to constitutionalize the existence of the University. The University is accorded unique constitutional status; thus, the Governor may only remove a regent if cause is established, preferably at a hearing prior to removal. February 2, 2007 Op. Att’y Gen.

      </p>
      <p>
       Non-monetary asset transfers are not appropriations subject to the governor’s enhanced veto under Alaska Const., art. II. Therefore, a 2000 bill (ch. 136, SLA 2000) allowing the University of Alaska to select between 250,000 and 260,000 acres of state lands which would then be conveyed to the university to manage, was not an appropriation, and an override of the governor’s veto required only a two-thirds majority in the legislature, not the three-fourths majority required for the overriding of a veto of an appropriations bill. Having received the required two-thirds majority, the veto was successfully overridden, and the bill, affecting this section, became law. State Legislative Council v. Knowles, 86 P.3d 891 (Alaska 2004).

        Amendment by ch. 136, SLA 2000 upheld. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Non-monetary asset transfers are not appropriations subject to the governor’s enhanced veto under Alaska Const., art. II. Therefore, a 2000 bill (ch. 136, SLA 2000) allowing the University of Alaska to select between 250,000 and 260,000 acres of state lands which would then be conveyed to the university to manage, was not an appropriation, and an override of the governor’s veto required only a two-thirds majority in the legislature, not the three-fourths majority required for the overriding of a veto of an appropriations bill. Having received the required two-thirds majority, the veto was successfully overridden, and the bill, affecting this section, became law. State Legislative Council v. Knowles, 86 P.3d 891 (Alaska 2004).

      The restrictive clause in the federal grant (see former 48 USC § 354, now 43 USC § 852) dated March 4, 1915, of lands for the site of the present university states that this land must be used as a site for an agricultural college and school of mines. 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 21.

      There appears to be no conflict with this required use by leasing, as is authorized by law, a portion of this land to a corporation for a definite period of time to provide a service which contributes to the required use. 1962 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 21.

       Non-monetary asset transfers are not appropriations subject to the governor’s enhanced veto under Alaska Const., art. II. Therefore, a 2000 bill (ch. 136, SLA 2000) allowing the University of Alaska to select between 250,000 and 260,000 acres of state lands which would then be conveyed to the university to manage, was not an appropriation, and an override of the governor’s veto required only a two-thirds majority in the legislature, not the three-fourths majority required for the overriding of a veto of an appropriations bill. Having received the required two-thirds majority, the veto was successfully overridden, and the bill, affecting this section, became law. State Legislative Council v.

       Non-monetary asset transfers are not appropriations subject to the governor’s enhanced veto under Alaska Const., art. II. Therefore, a 2000 bill (ch. 136, SLA 2000) allowing the University of Alaska to select between 250,000 and 260,000 acres of state lands which would then be conveyed to the university to manage, was not an appropriation, and an override of the governor’s veto required only a two-thirds majority in the legislature, not the three-fourths majority required for the overriding of a veto of an appropriations bill. Having received the required two-thirds majority, the veto was successfully overridden, and the bill, affecting this section, became law. State Legislative Council v. Knowles, 86 P.3d 891 (Alaska 2004).

       Non-monetary asset transfers are not appropriations subject to the governor’s enhanced veto under Alaska Const., art. II. Therefore, a 2000 amendment (ch. 136, SLA 2000) allowing the University of Alaska to select between 250,000 and 260,000 acres of state lands which would then be conveyed to the university to manage, was not an appropriation, and an override of the governor’s veto required only a two-thirds majority in the legislature, not the three-fourths majority required for the overriding of a veto of an appropriations bill. Having received the required two-thirds majority, the veto was successfully overridden, and the bill, affecting this section, became law. State Legislative Council v. Knowles, 86 P.3d 891 (Alaska 2004).

       For the purpose of securing one or more issues of bonds of the corporation, the board may establish one or more special funds, called “capital reserve funds,” and may pay into those capital reserve funds the proceeds of the sale of bonds and other money available to the corporation from other sources for the purposes of the capital reserve funds. A capital reserve fund may be established only if the board determines that the establishment of the fund would enhance the marketability of the bonds. Money in a capital reserve fund, except as provided in this section, may be used as required only for the (1) payment of the principal of, and interest on, bonds or of the sinking fund payments with respect to those bonds; (2) purchase or redemption of the bonds; or (3) payment of a redemption premium required to be paid when the bonds are redeemed before maturity. However, money in a capital reserve fund may not be withdrawn if the withdrawal would reduce the amount in the capital reserve fund to less than the capital reserve fund requirement, except for the purpose of making payment, when due, of principal, interest, or redemption premiums on the bonds when other money of the corporation is not available for the payments. Income or interest earned by, or increment to, a capital reserve fund, from the investment of all or part of the fund, may be transferred by the corporation to other funds or accounts of the corporation if the transfer does not reduce the amount of the capital reserve fund below the capital reserve fund requirement.

Valuation shall include the amount of interest earned or accrued as of the date of valuation.

       By January 15 of each year, the chairman of the board shall certify in writing to the governor and the legislature the amount, if any, required to restore a capital reserve fund to the capital reserve fund requirement. The legislature may appropriate to the corporation the amount certified by the chairman. The corporation shall deposit the amounts appropriated under this subsection during a fiscal year in the proper capital reserve fund. This subsection does not create a debt or liability of the state.

The corporation may allow a reserve fund established under this subsection to be depleted without complying with (d) of this section.

       The legislature finds that there is a wide and unacceptable disparity between the distribution of Native teachers and Native students in rural elementary and secondary schools in the state.  Many rural schools have virtually no Native teachers and no non-Native students. The undesirable effects of this disparity include the following:
       <ol>
        <li id="t14c43a10s14.43.600ol1a1">
         there is a serious weakness in the ability of teaching staffs in rural schools to foster a sense of Native traditions and cultures in the Native students;
        </li>
        <li id="t14c43a10s14.43.600ol1a2">
         many rural students are forced to exist in two entirely separate situations: the essentially traditional atmosphere of many Native homes, and the essentially modern atmosphere of the classroom;
        </li>
        <li id="t14c43a10s14.43.600ol1a3">
         almost no Native students return to rural schools to teach, continuing the imbalance and exacerbating its effects; and
        </li>
        <li id="t14c43a10s14.43.600ol1a4">
         there is an annual turnover of 40 percent among teachers in regional educational attendance areas in the state.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t14c43a10s14.43.600ol1b">
       The legislature further finds that existing programs have failed to increase the proportion of Natives teaching in rural schools.  Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to establish the teacher education loan program to encourage rural high school graduates to return to rural schools as teachers and relieve the conditions described in this section.

        provide a clearinghouse of information on matters relating to educational problems and how they are being met in different places throughout the nation, so that the executive and legislative branches of state government and of local communities may have ready access to the experience and record of the entire country, and so that both lay and professional groups in the field of education may have additional avenues for the sharing of experience and the interchange of ideas in the formation of public policy in education;

       Section C. The party states recognize that each of them has an interest in the quality and quantity of education furnished in each of the other states, as well as in the excellence of its own educational systems and institutions, because of the highly mobile character of individuals within the nation, and because the products and services contributing to the health, welfare and economic advancement of each state are supplied in significant part by persons educated in other states.

       Section E. Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states, the executive director subject to the approval of the steering committee shall appoint, remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the functions of the commission, and shall fix the duties and compensation of such personnel. The commission in its bylaws shall provide for the personnel policies and programs of the commission.

Any modified state minimum salary schedule arrived at as a result of receiving federal money may be put into effect by executive order signed by the governor or by order of the board, whichever appears to be the most nearly proper under federal law. This minimum salary schedule shall remain valid under the order until it is altered or approved in full by the legislature.

The amount of a basic grant must be equally matched by local money, the fair value of volunteer labor, or a combination of local money and volunteer labor. If the amount available for public library assistance grants during a fiscal year is not sufficient to fully fund basic grants for all eligible libraries, the amount available shall be prorated so that the amount of basic grants for all eligible libraries is reduced by the same percentage. After payment of basic grants to all eligible libraries during a fiscal year, any amount remaining for public library assistance grants shall be distributed as per capita grants to each library that received a basic grant. The amount of the per capita grants shall be based on the population of the municipality or unincorporated community served by each of the libraries.
