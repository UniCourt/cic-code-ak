       The second 1988 amendment, which added a new paragraph referring to the regulation of electrical administrators, was superseded by the enactment of ch. 98, SLA 1988, which reestablished the Board of Electrical Examiners, referred to in former paragraph (12). Consequently, the second 1988 amendment is not set out in the text of the section.

      <p>
       Under § 57, ch. 40, SLA 2008, the repeal of paragraph (16) by § 4, ch. 19, SLA 2008 was disregarded.

Paragraph (19) was enacted as (37); renumbered in 2002, at which time other paragraphs were also renumbered to maintain alphabetical order.

       <b>
        Scope of cease and desist order. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An order issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section must be limited to directing an individual to stop activities that are otherwise prohibited by the relevant statutes and regulations.
   It is not sufficient that the order be in the public interest; rather, that is an additional condition which must be met. State v. Smith, 593 P.2d 625 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The language of this section does not suggest that a power exists to enforce an order under subsection (b) of this section which prevents negligence by the expedient of preventing the dentist from practicing or by preventing him from practicing except under stringent limitations.
   It authorizes the prohibition of specific illegal acts which are likely to occur in the future. State v. Smith, 593 P.2d 625 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since under former AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t08c36a03s08.36.310" target="_self">08.36.310</a></cite> [see now AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t08c36a03s08.36.315" target="_self">08.36.315</a></cite>], the power to revoke a dentist’s license is discretionary and the board may impose less drastic penalties, it is clear that the legislature did not intend that it be per se illegal for persons who have committed the transgressions listed in former AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t08c36a03s08.36.310" target="_self">08.36.310</a></cite> [see now AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t08c36a03s08.36.315" target="_self">08.36.315</a></cite>] to continue to practice dentistry.
   Therefore orders cannot be based on a theory that a dentist violates the statutes merely by continuing his practice in an otherwise legal manner. State v. Smith, 593 P.2d 625 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this section is very specific as to the scope of a cease and desist order issued by the commissioner, it would plainly be improper to hold that there is a broader power implied. This is especially true since other statutes pertaining to the regulation of the dental profession authorize the board of dental examiners, not the commissioner, to revoke or suspend the license of a dentist, to impose conditions under which he or she may practice, and they define in comprehensive detail the grounds for such actions. State v. Smith, 593 P.2d 625 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The specific activities listed in former AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t08c36a03s08.36.310" target="_self">08.36.310</a></cite> [see now AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t08c36a03s08.36.315" target="_self">08.36.315</a></cite>], detailing the grounds for revocation of a dentist’s license, are clearly proscribed, and a hearing officer’s order limited to directing a dentist to stop such activities or activities otherwise prohibited by the relevant statutes and regulations is proper in scope. State v. Smith, 593 P.2d 625 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an order issued by a hearing officer which imposed significant conditions on a dentist’s right to practice his profession of oral surgery pending the outcome of license revocation proceedings before the state board of dental examiners, provisions prohibiting the dentist from administering general anesthesia and requiring him to maintain detailed patient records were held to be valid, while the other provisions, requiring the dentist to practice dentistry only in the office of another duly licensed, actively practicing dentist; to practice only during normal business hours with another dentist physically present and with nurses or dental assistants in the office; and to practice only on patients specifically referred to him in writing by another, duly licensed, and actively practicing, dentist or physician and to perform only those procedures for which the patients were specifically referred, were held invalid as exceeding the statutory authority upon which the order was based. State v. Smith, 593 P.2d 625 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Severability of order. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where some of the provisions of an order were limited to forbidding illegal acts and that some of them were not, and where it was possible to elide the excessive portions, it was not necessary that the entire order be vacated. State v. Smith, 593 P.2d 625 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Finality of order. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An order of the superior court that merely vacated modified order of the commissioner without ruling on the original order would not have resulted in the original order becoming final. Only if the person involved had failed to request a hearing within 15 days would that result have occurred. State v. Smith, 593 P.2d 625 (Alaska 1979).

Time spent in the performance of the duties of the law clerk is considered time spent in the study of law. The tutor must give personal direction regularly and frequently to the law clerk, must examine the law clerk at least once a month on the work done in the previous month, and must certify monthly as to compliance with the requirements of this subsection and (e) and (g) of this section.

      <p>
       Although the definition in Bar Rule 63 literally applies only to the criminal offense of the unlicensed practice of law, that rule also necessarily defines the conduct that, at a minimum, constitutes the unlicensed practice of law for non-criminal purposes. This is necessarily so because the civil law may not permit conduct which the criminal law prohibits. Christiansen v. Melinda, 857 P.2d 345 (Alaska 1993).

       An agent authorized to act for a principal under a statutory form power of attorney may not bring suit as a pro se litigant in the principal’s stead. The unlicensed, in-court representation of another is considered “engaging in the practice of law” and is thus, prohibited by Alaska’s statute proscribing the unlicensed “practice of law” under subsection (a). The statutory power of attorney does not overcome that prohibition. Christiansen v. Melinda, 857 P.2d 345 (Alaska 1993).

A shop owner shall be licensed to operate a shop without examination, but, unless the shop owner is a practitioner, the shop owner may not conduct business without employing a manager who is a practitioner. This subsection does not apply to a shop for the practice of barbering, hairdressing, hair braiding, or esthetics located in a community having a population of less than 1,000 people that is not within 25 miles of a community of more than 1,000 people.

Each practitioner of tattooing, permanent cosmetic coloring, or body piercing who holds a workshop or demonstrates techniques at a convention or special event shall have a separate temporary shop license and a license or temporary permit under this chapter to practice tattooing, permanent cosmetic coloring, or body piercing. The board shall issue a temporary shop license upon receipt of an application from a practitioner demonstrating compliance with the regulations adopted under this section and payment of the appropriate fee; however, the temporary shop license may be summarily revoked, without refunding of the fee, if the Department of Environmental Conservation determines after an inspection that the cleanliness or sanitation conditions at the site covered by the temporary license pose a clear and immediate danger to the public health or safety.

      Scope of contractor’s surety bond. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     A construction contractor failed to pay premiums to its workers’ compensation insurer. The insurer sued the contractor’s statutory surety bond, claiming the failure to pay was “a breach of contract in the conduct of the contracting business” under this chapter. Because the breach did not relate to the sort of activities the chapter addresses, the insurer was not allowed to recover against the bond. The legislature singled out contractors for bonding and registration requirements because it thought the activities described in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t08c18a04s08.18.171" target="_self">08.18.171</a></cite>(4) pose significant risks. The legislature did not require contractors to have surety bonds in order to cover the sort of routine contract breaches common to most businesses. Alaska Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Northwest Cedar Structures, Inc., 153 P.3d 336 (Alaska 2007).

       Under Alaska’s flexible approach for determining contractor status, set forth in AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t08c18a03s08.18.151" target="_self">08.18.151</a></cite>, a builder’s agreement to frame houses for a property owner did not, standing alone, make the builder a person acting in the capacity of a contractor, and thus, did not require the builder to register as a contractor. Larson v. Benediktsson, 152 P.3d 1159 (Alaska 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a contractor did not fall under the finished products exemption, it was required to register as a specialty steel contractor to install tower-mounted wind turbines. Therefore, the contractor's counterclaim against a property owner, who cancelled a contract to install a wind turbine on the owner's property and sued the contractor to recover the owner's down payment, was prohibited. Daggett v. Feeney, 397 P.3d 297 (Alaska 2017).

       Paragraph (8) (now (7)) of this section exists in substantially identical form in statutes in California and Washington, and has been interpreted there to exempt from registration one who prefabricates but does not install materials which become a part of real property.
   The supreme court of Alaska finds this interpretation persuasive. Industrial Power &amp; Lighting Corp. v. Western Modular Corp., 623 P.2d 291 (Alaska 1981).

        Contract to purchase prefabricated modular homes. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A contract to purchase prefabricated modular homes was, from the standpoint of the purchaser, a contract for which registration was required within the meaning of AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t08c18a03s08.18.151" target="_self">08.18.151</a></cite> when the purchaser was not exempt under the provisions of this section. Industrial Power &amp; Lighting Corp. v. Western Modular Corp., 623 P.2d 291 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a manufacturer of modular homes had no installation responsibilities under its contract, it was not required to register under this chapter in order to obtain payment in compensation for its performance of that contract.

   Such a result is plainly not contemplated by the statute since paragraph (13) (now (12)) of this section specifically exempts an owner-builder who constructs one building per year. By clear implication such owner-builders would be covered by the statute except for this exemption, and owner-builders who build more than one building per year are covered by the statute.

       The word “undertakes” as it is used in paragraph (3) (now (4)) of this section is not limited to a contractual undertaking, but must be understood in the more general sense of setting about, engaging in, or entering upon an activity described by the statute.

       Alaska legislature intended to limit statutory contract breach claims, and thus claims against the bonds, to breaches of contracts that are directly related to the sorts of listed activities that caused the legislature to conclude that regulation was necessary; therefore, an insurer was not allowed to recover unpaid workers’ compensation insurance premiums from a surety bond since that was not directly related to the conduct of the work of a contractor.

       In a guardian’s Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) medical malpractice suit, the United States did not present an expert qualified under this provision. State substantive law applies in FTCA actions, and the Alaska statute here is intertwined with the state’s professional negligence law because it limits what kind of professional can testify to the standard of care. That limitation, in turn, affects the standard of care against which the defendant’s conduct will be tested — an inherently substantive inquiry.

       In 2004, “Department of Community and Economic Development” was changed to “Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development” in paragraph (2) of this section to reconcile chs. 47 and 84, SLA 2004. In 2005, in paragraph (9), “AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t08c26a01s08.26.020" target="_self">08.26.020</a></cite>” was substituted for “AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t08c26a01s08.26.040" target="_self">08.26.040</a></cite>” to correct a manifest error in ch. 84, SLA 2004.

       So long as they are employed by Native Health clinics and treat patients authorized to receive care in those clinics, individuals certified as dental health aides by the federal Community Health Aide Certification Board do not have to comply with state dental licensure laws. The state dental licensure laws stand as an obstacle to Congress’ objective to provide dental treatment to Alaska Natives by using non-dentist, non-hygienist paraprofessionals. Therefore, the federal statute that mandates the development of the dental health aide standards and the certification of dental health aides displaces (or preempts) the state’s dental licensure law and renders it unenforceable against federally-certified dental health aides.

       Under former AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t08c36a03s08.36.310" target="_self">08.36.310</a></cite> [see now AS <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t08c36a03s08.36.315" target="_self">08.36.315</a></cite>], the board could, after a hearing, revoke a dentist’s license or take other disciplinary action in the event that he conducted himself in a manner described in one of its enumerated provisions.
   Since the power was discretionary and since the board could impose penalties less drastic than license revocation, it was clear that the legislature did not intend that it be per se illegal for persons who have committed the listed transgressions to continue to practice dentistry.

       So long as they are employed by Native Health clinics and treat patients authorized to receive care in those clinics, individuals certified as dental health aides by the federal Community Health Aide Certification Board do not have to comply with state dental licensure laws. The state dental licensure laws stand as an obstacle to Congress’ objective to provide dental treatment to Alaska Natives by using non-dentist, non-hygienist paraprofessionals. Therefore, the federal statute that mandates the development of the dental health aide standards and the certification of dental health aides displaces (or preempts) the state’s dental licensure law and renders it unenforceable against federally-certified dental health aides.

      This chapter is concerned with safety.
     </b>
     Allison v. State, 583 P.2d 813 (Alaska 1978).
    </p>
    <p>
     The legislature was primarily concerned with competency for protection of the public when it enacted this chapter. Allison v. State, 583 P.2d 813 (Alaska 1978).
    </p>
    <p>
     The supreme court’s construction of this chapter as being concerned with public safety is consistent with a subsequent declaration of legislative purpose in this section. Allison v. State, 583 P.2d 813 (Alaska 1978).
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      And contains precautions not fully encompassed under AS 18.60 or AS 18.62. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Although this chapter is found in the title regulating “Business and Professions” and AS 18.60 and AS 18.62 are under the title providing for “Health and Safety,” AS 08.40 provides safety precautions not fully encompassed under either AS 18.60 or AS 18.62. Allison v. State, 583 P.2d 813 (Alaska 1978).
    </p>
    <p>
     State inspection under AS 18.60 does not provide the same protection against poor work that is contemplated by this chapter, since the presence or responsibility of a licensed electrical contractor having knowledge of the codes is a constant influence, while state inspectors cannot continuously monitor to assure quality control. Allison v. State, 583 P.2d 813 (Alaska 1978).
    </p>
    <p>
     This chapter requires that a prospective licensee be examined on his or her familiarity with the national electrical code and the national electrical safety code, while such specific knowledge is not required in order to obtain a certificate of fitness under AS 18.62. Allison v. State, 583 P.2d 813 (Alaska 1978).
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      But contains no bonding requirement. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The supreme court was further influenced in its conclusion that AS 08.40 provides for public safety by the absence of a bonding requirement or other method of assuring financial responsibility. Allison v. State, 583 P.2d 813 (Alaska 1978).
    </p>
    <p>
     The exemptions in this chapter should be narrowly construed to effect their purpose. Allison v. State, 583 P.2d 813 (Alaska 1978).

       In a case in which an association representing naturopathic physicians challenged a new regulation that effectively forbids naturopaths from using and prescribing injectable vitamins and minerals, the Supreme Court concluded neither the text nor overall structure of
   AS 08.45 indicates that it conveys to naturopaths the authority to prescribe natural substances, including injectable vitamins and minerals. Because the legislature did not intend to grant prescriptive authority to naturopaths, the superior court properly granted summary judgment against the association on this issue.

      </p>
      <p>
       Forfeiture of an airplane worth $40,000 was not grossly disproportionate to defendant’s offense of possessing and transporting illegally taken game, because under this section when a licensed guide violates a hunting statute or regulation, or aids another person in doing so, the penalty for a first offense includes a fine of not more than $30,000, while the penalty for a second or subsequent offense includes a fine of up to $50,000.

        Argument moot. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's argument regarding the ambiguous meaning of “previously purchased” was moot as to his convictions for knowingly guiding a client on a hunt without a valid nonresident tag and/or harvest ticket, failing to report the illegal hunt, and tampering with a public record for falsifying the client's hunt and tag records because the jury was faced with a choice between the client's testimony that he did not fill out the paperwork or pay for the tag, and defendant's testimony that he did.

        Jury instruction. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       District court erred in allowing both sides to offer their own definitions of the term “previously purchased” because it had a duty to resolve the question of statutory interpretation and instruct the jury on the definition; defendant was entitled to reversal of his convictions for knowingly aiding a client in taking a brown bear without a valid nonresident big game tag and tampering with a public record for falsifying the client's big game hunt and tag records to indicate he had a valid tag.

      </p>
      <p>
       It was not excessive where the judge placed defendant on probation for 10 years and, as a condition of his probation, ordered defendant not to apply for a hunting or guiding license, because a sentencing court has the power to impose a condition of probation that prohibits a defendant from pursuing a licensed activity for longer than the maximum period of license suspension or revocation that might be imposed as a direct term of the defendant’s sentence.

       Interstate fee differentials which were not predicated on movement of articles of interstate commerce across state lines, but rather upon the residency status of those applying for permits, were to be analyzed under the privileges and immunities or the equal protection clauses, not under the commerce clause. Carlson v. Commercial Fisheries Entry Comm'n, 919 P.2d 1337 (Alaska 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1101, 117 S. Ct. 789, 136 L. Ed. 2d 730 (U.S. 1997).

      <p>
       Case challenging validity of higher nonresident rates for nonresident commercial fishermen was remanded for application of the “per capita formula” in determining whether the higher fees charged to nonresidents are equivalent to the burden borne by residents as measured by the residents’ pro rata shares of state revenues to which nonresidents make no contribution. Carlson v. Commercial Fisheries Entry Comm'n, 919 P.2d 1337 (Alaska 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1101, 117 S. Ct. 789, 136 L. Ed. 2d 730 (U.S. 1997).

       A pilot organization recognized by the board shall adopt and publish rates for the provision of pilotage services. The pilot organization shall adopt rates for pilotage services as provided under this section. Notwithstanding this section, a pilot organization may enter into agreements with the master, owner, operator, or agent of a master, owner, or operator, of a vessel for the provision of pilotage services at rates of compensation that are different from the rates adopted under this section. Unless a pilot organization has an agreement with the master, owner, operator, or agent of a master, owner, or operator, of a vessel that sets rates for the provision of a pilotage service, the pilot organization may not charge a rate for the provision of the pilotage service to the vessel that is different from the rate adopted or established under this section.

       If a pilot organization intends to adopt a new or revised rate for the provision of a pilotage service, the pilot organization shall, before October 15, send a notice of intent to adopt a rate for provision of the pilotage service to the board and to all registered agents and publish the notice on at least three days during a period of 14 consecutive days in a newspaper of general circulation in the state. The notice of intent to adopt a rate must include a copy of the proposed rate and the name and mailing address of the pilot organization that intends to adopt the rate. If no objection to the proposed rate is filed with the board under (c) of this section, the rate takes effect on January 1 of the year following the year in which the notice of the intent to adopt the rate was filed with the board.

       The master, owner, operator, or agent of the master, owner, or operator, of a vessel required to employ a pilot under this chapter may object to the proposed rate for a specific pilotage service by filing a written notice of objection, containing the grounds for the objection and relevant evidence demonstrating that the rate is not reasonable, with the board within 60 days after the final date of publication of the proposed rate in a newspaper of general circulation. The pilot organization that proposed the rate has until 15 days after the close of the period for filing objections to the proposed rate to provide its written response to the notice of objection and relevant evidence demonstrating that the rate is reasonable. If the pilot organization does not respond to the notice of objection by the close of the 15-day period for response to the objection, the board may not take action on the proposed rate and the proposed rate does not take effect. If the pilot organization does respond to the notice of objection before the close of the response period, the board shall hold a hearing to determine whether the proposed rate is reasonable. If the board finds that the proposed rate is reasonable, the rate is approved and takes effect retroactive to January 1 of the calendar year in which the rate would have taken effect under (b) of this section if no objection had been filed. If the board finds that the proposed rate is not reasonable, the proposed rate is disapproved and does not take effect. In determining what constitutes a reasonable rate, the board shall consider the following factors:

If the proposed rate is less than the current rate, then the pilot organization is liable to the master, owner, or operator of the vessel or the vessel for reimbursement of the amount overpaid for the provision of pilotage services during the pendency of the review by the board due to the retroactive application of the approved rate under (c) of this section.

The notice of intent to adopt a rate must include a copy of the proposed rate and the name and mailing address of the pilot organization that intends to adopt the rate.

       The operator of a pleasure craft of foreign registry of more than 65 feet overall length but less than 175 feet overall length may apply for an exemption from the pilotage requirement of this chapter. If an exemption is applied for and the fee prescribed under AS 08.62.140(b) is paid, the board may issue the exemption to the operator of the vessel. The exemption is valid for one year from the date on which the exemption is issued. The application for an exemption must be submitted to the board at least 30 days before the vessel enters the state. The board shall approve or deny an application for the exemption within 10 working days after the application is received by the board. If the board does not approve or disapprove the application within 10 working days, the exemption is considered to be approved, and the board shall issue the exemption. The 10-day period for action by the board is suspended while the board is waiting for a response to a request by the board for additional information from the applicant. An exemption issued under this subsection may be revoked by the board if the vessel is not operated in a manner that is appropriate to protect human life, property, and the marine environment or if the vessel does not comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws. The exemption must remain on the vessel while the vessel is in state water. An exemption issued under this subsection does not exempt a vessel from the requirement to employ a pilot licensed under this chapter while the vessel is in Wrangell Narrows or in the water between Chatham Strait and Sitka via Peril Strait.

   However, a license may not be returned to the licensee if the voluntary surrender resulted in the dropping or suspension of civil or criminal charges against the physician.

A hospital shall also report to the board the name and address of a person licensed to practice medicine or osteopathy in the state if the person resigns hospital staff privileges while under investigation by the hospital or a committee of the hospital and the investigation could result in the revocation, suspension, conditioning, or restricting of, or the refusal to grant, hospital privileges, or in the imposition of a consultation requirement.

A report is not required if the sole reason for the action is the person’s failure to complete hospital records in a timely manner or to attend staff or committee meetings.

        Unethical behavior. —

       A physician may be subject to loss of license, censure or reprimand for violating the state Medical Association declaration that publication of patients’ names by board members in complying with AS 39.50 (Conflict of Interest law) is unethical.
   However, the possibility of professional discipline for unethical behavior is irrelevant because the statutory exemption applies only to legal privileges, not ethical mandates.
   Moreover, to equate ethical directives with legal privilege for purposes of AS 39.50, particularly where a relevant professional standard has been enacted subsequent to the passage of the Conflict of Interest law, would effectively allow an elite professional group to amend the law by declaring itself exempt.

       Upon receiving a notice of a finding under AS 47.05.055 that a certified nurse aide has committed abuse, neglect, or misappropriation of property, the board shall immediately revoke the nurse aide’s certification without a hearing, enter the finding in the registry, and notify the nurse aide of the revocation and entry of the finding. Notice is considered given when delivered personally to the nurse aide or deposited in the United States mail addressed to the nurse aide’s last known mailing address on file with the board. The department shall retain proof of mailing.

       If the certified nurse aide is employed in a skilled nursing facility or a nursing facility, other than an intermediate care facility for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities, that is participating in the Medicaid or Medicare program, only the state survey and certification agency may make, and report to the board, a finding that the certified nurse aide has committed abuse, neglect, or misappropriation of property in connection with the nurse aide’s employment at the facility.

       The board shall establish procedures under which a finding under AS 47.05.055 that a certified nurse aide has committed abuse, neglect, or misappropriation of property and the resulting revocation of certification will be removed from the registry if the certified nurse aide requests a hearing and can establish mistaken identity or the finding has been set aside by the reporting agency or by a court of competent jurisdiction.

    <p>
     Pharmacists employed by tribal health programs generally do not need to be licensed in Alaska as long as they are licensed in another state, under the provisions of 25 U.S.C. 450 et seq., known as “Section 221”. This provision expressly overrides state licensing requirements for a pharmacist who qualifies by being licensed in another state. The State Board may require proof of out-of-state licensure and tribal health program employment status, and retains disciplinary authority over tribal health program pharmacists who are licensed in Alaska. Also, federally certified community health aides do not have to obtain pharmacist or pharmacy technician license even if they are performing pharmacy-related functions as long as they are within their scope of practice. 25 U.S.C. § 1616l implicitly preempts state law in that regard. See 2005 Inf. Op. Att’y Gen. (Sept. 8; 663-05-0152). 2012 Op. Alaska Att’y Gen. (April 17).

       If the board of directors of a community association allows a broker to exercise control over community association fees or other community association funds, the broker must provide evidence to the commission that the broker is covered by a blanket fidelity insurance bond. The bond may be in the name of the broker with the association as an additional insured or in the name of the association with the broker as an additional insured. The bond must cover the maximum funds that will be within the control of the community association manager at any time while the bond is in force. The commission may grant an exemption from the bonding requirement of this subsection if the commission determines that the community association manager has equivalent comparable coverage or that coverage is unavailable. The commission may adopt regulations to implement this subsection, including regulations concerning the minimum coverage and terms of coverage that are required and proof of bond and the granting of exemptions.

      <p>
       The purpose of this section, which requires a written listing, was not to relieve agents of their fiduciary obligations, but rather to protect the public from the fraudulent acts of dishonest agents. Black v. Dahl, 625 P.2d 876 (Alaska 1981).

        Enforcement of oral agreement. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Although a real estate agent cannot enforce an oral agreement, a client can. Black v. Dahl, 625 P.2d 876 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the absence of a written listing, a fiduciary duty is established between a real estate agent and a client by their oral agreement. Black v. Dahl, 625 P.2d 876 (Alaska 1981).

      A real estate broker shall maintain a sign at each of the broker’s registered real estate offices prominently showing the name of the real estate business as registered with the commission. The required size, content, and location of signs under this section may be determined by the commission under regulations. The regulations must allow signs in offices located on premises with more restrictive sign requirements than would otherwise be applicable under the commission’s regulations to be considered to be in compliance with the regulations if the signs meet the requirements of the premises and the licensee submits a copy of the sign requirements of the premises to the commission.

       A real estate licensee, when applying for or renewing a real estate license, in lieu of obtaining a corporate surety bond, shall pay to the commission, in addition to the license fee, a recovery fund fee not to exceed $125. After each two-year licensing cycle, if the commission finds that the average balance in the recovery fund during the two-year licensing cycle was less than $250,000 or more than $500,000, the commission shall by regulation adjust the recovery fund fees so that the average balance of the recovery fund during the next two-year licensing cycle is anticipated to be an amount that is not less than $250,000 or more than $500,000. In this subsection, “average balance” means the average balance after taking into account anticipated expenditures for awards from the fund and legal expenses directly related to fund operations, and for real estate educational purposes.

       The Real Estate Commission erred in denying a seller’s claim for reimbursement when it failed to address the question, raised by the seller, of the refundability of an advance down payment. Thus, remand was necessary for a determination of this issue. Knedlik v. Dept. of Commerce &amp; Economic Dev., 803 P.2d 400 (Alaska 1990).

      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support the Alaska Real Estate Commission’s finding of fraudulent misrepresentation, where the listing agent misrepresented the home’s availability by: (1) Inaccurately describing the home as an “active listing;” (2) prematurely telling the buyer that the originally-accepted offer had been rescinded; and (3) incorrectly assuring the buyer that her own offer had been accepted and that the house was hers, and the listing agent knew the representations were untrue or unfounded when he made them, or expected that the buyer would rely on them.
