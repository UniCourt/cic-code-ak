The new plat’s notation of the 30-foot right of way in the subdivision had the legal effect of dedicating the disputed land to the public. Cowan v. Yeisley, 255 P.3d 966 (Alaska 2011).

        Many of the cases cited in the notes below were decided under former law.

        <b>
         Equitable estoppel against assertion of title. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        A properly recorded title normally precludes an equitable estoppel against assertion of that title due to the requirement that the party raising the estoppel be ignorant of the true state of title or reasonable means of discovering it. Dressel v. Weeks, 779 P.2d 324 (Alaska 1989).

         Interest of real estate lender in fixtures. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Industrial lighting and circuit breakers wired into a warehouse’s electrical system that could be removed without damaging the warehouse structure were fixtures, and the holder of a recorded deed of trust had a security interest in the fixtures which followed them upon their removal by the installer who took them subject to the lender’s interest. K &amp; L Distribs. v. Kelly Elec., 908 P.2d 429 (Alaska 1995).

         Notice of invalid claim held ineffective. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a vacant property sold by a wife was no longer the family residence, it did not constitute a home or homestead and this section did not protect any interest of the husband’s in the property. The husband’s notice of interest was not a valid claim, and summary judgment was properly granted against the husband. Gottstein v. Kraft, 274 P.3d 469 (Alaska 2012).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where a deed had but one witness, two then being necessary to to authorize the recording of a deed, and the only acknowledgment was before the deed was altered, it was filed without authority, was not entitled to registration and had no effect as against people with actual notice.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the expressed consideration is nominal, and not paid, a grantee accepting a quitclaim deed with full knowledge of a prior unrecorded deed, is not a bona fide purchaser for value, nor a “subsequent innocent purchaser... in good faith for a valuable consideration,” such as is described in this section, and the outstanding deed would not be void as to such a purchaser.
        Crossly v. Campion Mining Co., 1 Alaska 391 (D. Alaska 1901), distinguishing Sabo v. Horvath, 559 P.2d 1038 (Alaska 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        A quitclaim grantee can be protected by the recording system, assuming, of course, the grantee purchased for value consideration and did not otherwise have actual or constructive knowledge as defined by the recording laws. Sabo v. Horvath, 559 P.2d 1038 (Alaska 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Quitclaim deed, recorded outside the chain of title, did not give constructive notice to subsequent grantees and was not “duly recorded” under former AS 34.15.290. Sabo v. Horvath, 559 P.2d 1038 (Alaska 1976).

        An unrecorded conveyance is void only against a subsequent innocent purchaser in good faith and for a valuable consideration of the same property, and is otherwise valid as between the parties. Pilip v. United States, 186 F. Supp. 397 (D. Alaska 1960).

        does not make an instrument invalid as between the parties to it, but rather only precludes its recordation and thus its effectiveness as against third persons. Smalley v. Juneau Clinic Bldg. Corp., 493 P.2d 1296 (Alaska 1972).

         An unrecorded deed is valid as to privies of parties. —

       </p>
       <p>
        Failure of recordation does not affect the validity of a deed as between parties and privies, for purposes of estoppel or otherwise. James v. Nelson, 90 F.2d 910, 9 Alaska 117 (9th Cir. Alaska), cert. denied, 302 U.S. 721, 58 S. Ct. 41, 82 L. Ed. 556 (U.S. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        This statute was intended to protect innocent purchasers against unrecorded deeds to third parties, and not to deprive such purchasers of their title, as against their own grantors’ privies, merely because their grantors had failed to record their deed. As to innocent purchasers, this section is a shield, not a sword. James v. Nelson, 90 F.2d 910, 9 Alaska 117 (9th Cir. Alaska), cert. denied, 302 U.S. 721, 58 S. Ct. 41, 82 L. Ed. 556 (U.S. 1937).

        It would be impossible for one who was not present on the ground to pay valuable consideration in good faith for real property in reliance upon the public records if his title could be overthrown by proof of vague squatter’s occupancy of land, general rumors, reports, surmises or general assertions as to ownership or title to lands where the deed is not timely of record.

      As to confidentiality of oil and gas documents held by state agencies, see Nov. 24, 1980 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the taxpayer files the notice of appeal, a Department of Revenue hearing decision may be made public because the taxpayer is, in effect, waiving any right to confidentiality he may have had. June 16, 1983 Op. Att’y Gen., modifying March 12, 1980 Op. Att’y Gen. to the extent that the time when the decision becomes a part of the public record is changed from the issuance of a court order to prepare the record to the filing of the notice of the appeal.

      Certain provisions contained in a Subscriber Service Agreement with the Credit Bureau of Alaska, which provided that the subscriber (the Division of Accounting and Collections) agreed to make available to the credit bureau “all its consumer credit experience records pertaining to individuals located with the Bureau’s geographic area of file building,” did not violate the individual privacy of borrowers. May 11, 1984 Op. Att’y Gen.

      Documents of the Alaska Real Estate Commission, including complaints (both licensing and surety fund), investigative files (to the extent that they do not contain constitutionally protected private information and insofar as the integrity of the investigation is not compromised), closed license files, hearing officer’s proposed decisions, and subpoenas are public information and may not be kept confidential. Also, the hearing officer’s proposed decisions are public record. 1984-2 Inf. Op. Atty. Gen. 269 (October 9; 166-154-85).
     </p>
     <p>
      All materials received in response to the request for proposals (RFP) for the Anchorage Office Complex (AOC) were “public documents” subject to disclosure, but disclosure of certain records could have been delayed until a tentative contract award. During the evaluation process, the financial component of any proposal was not subject to disclosure. Further, the state or its agents could have properly declined to disclose records which would have compromised the anonymity of the aesthetic evaluation process. Jan. 30, 1985 Op. Att’y Gen.

      The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has the authority to provide the public with copies of the audits it receives under 2 AAC 45.010 (audits submitted by entities that have received state financial assistance from state agencies). Aug. 12, 1987 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Mental Health Board may have access to documents reflecting communications between the Department of Law and the Department of Health and Social Services to the extent that the commissioner of health and social services believes is appropriate. To the extent that the commissioner authorizes such access for documents which nonetheless are not subject to public disclosure (e.g., subject to the attorney/client privilege or the executive privilege), the board is required to preserve that confidentiality. Aug. 15, 1988 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The names of purchasers of homes and condominiums, and the sales prices, are not confidential, and thus may be released to the public. Jan. 9, 1989 Op. Att’y Gen.

     <p>
      College transcripts of certified teachers or certificate applicants are not confidential, and they must be released at the request of a member of the public. Nov. 4, 1992 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The policy favoring disclosure of public records supports the conclusion that records maintained by the charitable gaming division are open to public scrutiny. Any conclusion to the contrary would require compelling evidence of legislative intent to shroud these records in confidentiality. In the absence of such evidence, these records are open to public inspection. 1996 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 4.

      Disclosing library use records, while deleting any references which would allow the library patron to be identified, should, in most cases, satisfy the policies underlying the Freedom of Information Act without interfering with privacy interests. There may, however, be some instances in which the release of names is necessary to accomplish an important public interest. Such requests should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis with advice from the Department of Law. July 13, 1984 Op. Att’y Gen.

      The Alaska Judicial Council is a public agency, and its records are public records subject to the provisions of this section. Oct. 3, 1984 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Judicial Council is authorized to adopt rules and regulations regarding the confidentiality of its own records, provided they are consistent with state statutes, including this section. For those cases where considerations favoring disclosure are nearly equal to those favoring confidentiality, rules or regulations may, and indeed should, be adopted to set guidelines for use in deciding whether disclosure should be made.

      Any letters concerning judicial applicants which are transferred by the Judicial Council to the governor remain confidential in the hands of the governor and should not be disclosed to the public.

      Portions of trip memoranda prepared by the governor which related to personal matters were not public records subject to release. Further, the “public record” portion of the trip memoranda were communications which the governor’s office, in its discretion, could have declined to release under the doctrine of executive privilege. Finally, even if the governor waived any claim to executive privilege, he should have declined to release material which compromised an individual’s privacy rights, unless a waiver was obtained.

      The radio frequencies of the Department of Fish and Games telemetry transmitters that are used to track wildlife in the state should not normally be disclosed to the public because this disclosure would be against the public interest. While there is no state statute specifically requiring these radio frequencies to be kept confidential, there are two other sources of “state law” under which records may be required to be kept confidential: (1) the right of privacy specified in article I, section 22 of the Alaska Constitution: and (2) the common-law “public interest” exception.

      In response to a public records request received by the Division of Retirement and Benefits concerning former state troopers, firemen, and fish and wildlife protection officers who were receiving occupational disability benefits under the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS), which request included asking for the recipients’ names, former positions with the state, dates of injury, types of injury or disability, retirement dates, and amounts of monthly benefits, the public interest was served by providing the requested information, but, in order to protect the privacy interests of the benefit recipients, all personal references and information that would have easily allowed identification of individuals had to be deleted.

      Certain private business records in the possession of the Department of Commerce and Economic Development, which were submitted voluntarily, in order for the department to carry out its statutory duty to conduct economic development studies relating to domestic fish harvesting, which records included those used by seafood processors to formulate business plans for future years — data on volume/species mixes, target areas of the state, and market share information — were probably not a matter of public record, but this result may have varied depending on the content of particular documents. Without a regulation based on statutory or constitutional authority, the department had to, in each case, balance the interest of the business with the public’s right to know. Dec. 8, 1986 Op.

      Active investigation files of the Alaska Public Offices Commission (APOC) cannot be viewed and copied. There are at least three demonstrable public and private interests which, at least in the aggregate, outweigh the public’s right to have access to these files: (1) the agency and the public have an interest in preserving the integrity and effectiveness of law enforcement investigations, and that interest may be jeopardized by the release of active investigative files; (2) release of unevaluated information to the public may unfairly impair the reputation of the subjects of the investigation, and may come perilously close to violating their due process rights guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions; and (3) Alaska’s constitutional right to privacy requires APOC to use extreme caution in disclosing unverified or unevaluated charges of materials obtained by the agency in the course of an investigation.

      The Child Support Enforcement Division could release a list of child support obligors who are in arrears, pursuant to a request by a newspaper under the state’s public records statutes. In releasing this information, however, the division could not identify those cases which were related to Aid to Family with Dependent Children. The division also had to explain to the newspaper that the existence of arrears was disputable by the individual obligors. May 30, 1989 Op. Att’y Gen.

      The Workers’ Compensation Division may not, in response to a public information request, release its electronic data base in its entirety, but may release the information contained in the data base if social security numbers are deleted. Public agencies are prohibited under the federal Privacy Act of 1974 from disclosing claimants’ social security numbers if the claimants were not informed whether the disclosure was voluntary or mandatory or told of the potential uses of the numbers when the number was provided. Furthermore the release of an electronic data base that contains names matched with individual social security numbers in response to a public information request appears to violate the protections intended under the Privacy Act.

      The first step when a request for records is received is to determine whether the requester is involved in litigation, or is representing someone involved in litigation, with the state or one of its agencies. If so, the request must be denied. The person should be advised that the records can only be produced in response to a subpoena or discovery order. In other instances, a specific determination as to the existence of an exemption should be made, especially in cases related to criminal investigations.

      remains a public record subject to disclosure and copying even if the record is used for, included in, or relevant to litigation, including law enforcement proceedings, involving a public agency, except that with respect to a person involved in litigation, the records sought shall be disclosed in accordance with the rules of procedure applicable in a court or an administrative adjudication. In this section, “involved in litigation” means a party to litigation or representing a party to litigation, including obtaining public records for the party.

     <p>
      There are legitimate public policy reasons for differentiating between record requests made by parties involved in litigation against the state and those made by other parties. When the state is involved in the litigation, requiring the discovery rules to apply to documents sought by the other side ensures that the state is not disadvantaged in litigation by its public records statutes. In short, it ensures equal footing for the state. This analysis simply does not apply when the state isn’t a party to the litigation. Thus, a request for public records from a person who is involved in litigation with the state should be declined, with the explanation that the person must obtain the document through the discovery process under the Civil Rules. If it not clear from the face of the request, the person should be asked if he or she is involved in litigation with an agency of the state. 1994 Inf. Op. Atty. Gen. 99 (February 4; 663-94-0509).

       Residents, who had a strong interest in the issue at hand, challenged plans of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) for various shipping entities with respect to oil discharge. DEC violated the residents’ due process rights under Alaska Const. art. I, § 7 by predicating their request for relevant records on completion of those records by the agency, and by dismissing them from the appeal when they did not pay preparation costs for the agency’s record.

       Environmental groups were properly assessed the costs to prepare an administrative record because (1) an agency’s governing regulations did not require the agency to use a particular record-keeping process, and (2) the cost assessed was voluntarily reduced to account for the agency’s admitted inefficiencies in compiling the record.

      Permanent fund dividend applications are most certainly included as records developed by a public agency preserved both for informational value and as evidence of the operation of the agency, i.e., they are public records. In 1990, the legislature passed laws directing the state to provide special notice when requiring a person to supply personal information so that the person may, among other things, challenge the accuracy or completeness of the information. As a part of this Act, the legislature adopted a definition of “personal information.” This definition specifically excludes a person’s name and address. Thus, a person’s name and address are subject to disclosure, and the Department of Revenue must provide the names and addresses of PFD applicants to any member of the public who requests the information and pays the required fees. 1992 Inf. Op. Atty. Gen. 161 (April 1; 663-92-0163).
