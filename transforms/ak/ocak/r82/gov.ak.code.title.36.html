The rate shall remain in effect for the life of the contract or for 24 calendar months, whichever is shorter. At the end of the initial 24-month period, if new wage determinations have been issued by the department, the latest wage determination shall become effective for the next 24-month period or until the contract is completed, whichever occurs first. This process shall be repeated until the contract is completed.

        “Public construction.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Factors considered in determining whether a project constituted “public construction” included: (1) the nature of the contract (whether the contract was for the provision of funds or for the construction itself; (2) whether the structure would be used for a public purpose; (3) whether the state would control the structure after construction; (4) whether the state would continue to fund the project after construction; and (5) the relative portion of project financing that the state supplied. Western Alaska Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council v. Inn-Vestment Assocs., 909 P.2d 330 (Alaska 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case involving the question whether involvement of the Alaska Railroad Corporation (ARRC) in a general partnership with private investors for construction of a hotel implicated Alaska’s Little Davis-Bacon Act, evidence was sufficient to conclude that the project was “public construction” where it showed that ARRC undertook significant liability that was of benefit to the investors in obtaining a construction loan, that its involvement in the project was due not only to an investment incentive, but also to its desire to augment its passenger business and further development of the area, that ARRC had pursued investment in hotels in a continuing course of action, and that it wielded substantial power in the functioning of the partnership.

       Whether employer was required to pay prevailing wages under the Little Davis-Bacon Act to workers employed at a quarry thirteen miles from the site of an airport construction project, under Department of Labor’s regulation that broadly defined the term “on-site” to encompass activities occurring away from the construction site but dedicated exclusively to the construction project, required fact-specific analysis under 8 AAC 30.910. Bd. of Trade, Inc. v. State, DOL, Wage &amp; Hour Admin., 968 P.2d 86 (Alaska 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employer did not have to pay prevailing wages under Alaska’s Little Davis-Bacon Act to workers employed at a quarry located 13 miles from the site of an airport construction project; the quarry was not “on-site” because the quarry could not be viewed as “adjacent” to the airport project when there were alternative sites that separated the quarry from the project footprint.

       A city as the contracting government entity meets the requirement of subsection (a) by appending to its invitation to bid the most recent schedule of prevailing wages as published by the Department of Labor. Fowler v. City of Anchorage, 583 P.2d 817 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where neither the city or the contractor had knowledge of a change in the wage rates prior to the bidding on the contract and the wage rates attached to the invitation to bid were correct when the invitation was published, even though three days after publication the rate schedule was revised, the city was not negligent in failing to amend its specifications when it discovered the change, after the contract was let but before the work had commenced and reliance by the contractor on any wage representations in the contract was unreasonable. Fowler v. City of Anchorage, 583 P.2d 817 (Alaska 1978).

       The legislature finds that
       <ol>
        <li id="t36c10s36.10.005ol1a1">
         because of its unique climate and its distance from the contiguous states, the state has historically suffered from unique social, seasonal, geographic, and economic conditions that result in an unstable economy;
        </li>
        <li id="t36c10s36.10.005ol1a2">
         the unstable economy is a hardship on the residents of the state and is aggravated by the large numbers of seasonal and transient nonresident workers;
        </li>
        <li id="t36c10s36.10.005ol1a3">
         the rate of unemployment among residents of the state is one of the highest in the nation;
        </li>
        <li id="t36c10s36.10.005ol1a4">
         the state has one of the highest ratios of nonresident to resident workers in the nation;
        </li>
        <li id="t36c10s36.10.005ol1a5">
         the state has a compelling interest in reducing the level of unemployment among its residents;
        </li>
        <li id="t36c10s36.10.005ol1a6">
         the construction industry in the state accounts for a substantial percentage of the available employment;
        </li>
        <li id="t36c10s36.10.005ol1a7">
         construction workers receive a greater percentage of all unemployment benefits paid by the state than is typical of other states;
        </li>
        <li id="t36c10s36.10.005ol1a8">
         historically, the rate of unemployment in the construction industry in the state is higher than the rate of unemployment in other industries in the state;
        </li>
        <li id="t36c10s36.10.005ol1a9">
         it is appropriate for the state to consider the welfare of its residents when it funds construction activity;
        </li>
        <li id="t36c10s36.10.005ol1a10">
         it is in the public interest for the state to allocate public funds for capital projects in order to reduce unemployment among its resident construction workers;
        </li>
        <li id="t36c10s36.10.005ol1a11">
         the influx of nonresident construction workers contributes to or causes the high unemployment rate among resident construction workers because nonresident workers compete with residents for the limited number of available construction jobs;
        </li>
        <li id="t36c10s36.10.005ol1a12">
         nonresident workers displace a substantial number of qualified, available, and unemployed Alaska workers on jobs on state funded public works projects;

         the natural resources of land owned by the state belong to the citizens of the state;

         the vast majority of the state’s revenue is derived from natural resource income rather than from other forms of taxation;
        </li>
        <li id="t36c10s36.10.005ol1a17">
         because the state has no personal income tax or sales tax, nonresident workers use services provided by the state but do not contribute fairly to the costs of those services; and
        </li>
        <li id="t36c10s36.10.005ol1a18">
         Alaskans, more than the residents of other states, suffer economically when nonresidents displace qualified residents since resident workers contribute local taxes as well as their share of the royalties from natural resources.

        <li id="t36c10s36.10.005ol1b1">
         the state and its political subdivisions, when acting as a market participant in funding public works projects, should give Alaska residents an employment preference to promote a more stable economy;

         the state and its political subdivisions have a duty of loyalty to their citizens and should fulfill this duty by giving residents preference for employment on public works projects they fund;

         there is a legitimate and compelling governmental interest and that the public health and welfare will suffer if state residents are not afforded employment preference in state-funded construction-related work.

         many rural state residents who wish to work do not seek employment as frequently as necessary to meet federal definitions of unemployment because of continuing lack of employment opportunities in rural areas of the state.

      It is not exactly clear how the current United States Supreme Court will treat state home-state purchasing preference laws when “downstream” effects, interfering with natural market forces, are substantial, so state and municipal corporation administrators using state money to finance public projects should be cautious about reaching too far into the market place beyond those directly supplying to and contracting with public agencies, and should be especially cautious when foreign commerce is involved.

       The award of a state public works contract and the making of payments under that contract raise a presumption that the required bond has been furnished; thus, a laborer or materialman should not have to inquire into the validity of the bond before furnishing labor or materials.

       A person furnishing labor or materials on a state public works project does not deal directly with the surety company or its purported agent.
       In many cases he does not even deal directly with the prime contractor who obtained the bond.
       He is in a relatively poor position to inquire into whether an agent with whom the prime contractor dealt had authority to bind the insurance company appearing as surety on the bond.
       The insurance company has far better access to the facts surrounding the nature of the purported agency relationship than does a laborer or materialman on a state public works project.

     Superior court properly granted a motion by the State, as lessee, to dismiss the lessor's breach of contract action because the action was governed by the Alaska State Procurement Code and the lessor had failed to exhaust its remedies before filing suit where the lease at issue was a State lease of privately owned real property for the use of the State, and procurement included functions that pertained to all phases of contract administration, not just the initial signing of a lease or purchase contract.

     Percentage of savings claim. — A building owner's claim seeking monetary compensation calculated as a percentage of the savings on a lease was a form of creative advocacy, and without evidence that the owner asserted the claim in order to delay, harass, or increase the costs of litigation, the claim, by itself, did not constitute an abuse of the judicial process. Because the percentage of savings claim was based on a non-frivolous argument for establishing new law, it was an abuse of discretion to sanction the owner for bringing the claim.

      While the Alaska Energy Authority may execute contracts for construction of power projects, it probably cannot execute a project labor agreement that prefers the hire of employees who are members of a labor union (based upon the equal protection concern of favoring one group of similarly situated workers over another). But see
      1999 Op. Att’y Gen. No. 12, which, based upon the decision in
      <i>
       Laborers Local # 942 v. Lampkin, 956 P.2d. 422 (Alaska 1998)
      </i>
      , rescinded the portion of this opinion which addressed the equal protection concerns raised by the use of project labor agreements. The portion of this opinion which addressed the possible illegality of project labor agreements under state procurement regulations remains in effect.

      The purpose of bidder preference for resident firms when the state acts as a market participant is to encourage local industry, strengthen and stabilize the economy, decrease unemployment, and strengthen the tax and revenue base of the state.

      A contract modification, change order, or contract price adjustment under a construction contract in excess of an amount established by regulation of the commissioner is subject to prior written certification by the fiscal officer of the agency responsible for funding the project or the contract, or other official responsible for monitoring and reporting upon the status of the costs of the total project budget or contract budget, as to the effect of the contract modification, change order, or adjustment in contract price on the total project budget or the total contract budget. If the certification of the fiscal officer or other responsible official discloses a resulting increase in the total project budget or the total contract budget, the procurement officer may not approve the contract modification, change order, or adjustment in contract price unless sufficient funds are available, or the scope of the project or contract is adjusted to permit the degree of completion that is feasible within the total project budget or total contract budget as it existed before the contract modification, change order, or adjustment in contract price under consideration. A contract modification, change order, or adjustment in contract that is signed by both parties and has been reasonably relied on by a contractor is presumed to be valid even if the provisions of this section have not been met.

Except for a lease rate adjustment called for in the lease, a claim under this section must be filed within 90 days after the contractor becomes aware of the basis of the claim or should have known the basis of the claim, whichever is earlier.

      The exception in paragraph (b)(1) for grants applies where: 1) the legislature makes an appropriation to a specific program for a specific purpose; 2) the appropriation is for a donative purpose that would more traditionally be characterized as a grant (rather than the purchase of services or supplies); and 3) the nature of the program, known to the legislature, makes application of the procurement code difficult or unreasonable.

      The State Procurement Code does not apply to decisions of the Department of Fish and Game (DF&amp;G) concerning allocation to private nonprofit hatcheries of federal funds granted to the state in connection with the U.S./Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty, since the transaction that occurs when DF&amp;G selects and allocates federal grant money to private nonprofit hatchery projects is not contractual under the State Procurement Code.

      The State Procurement Code does not apply to contracts for the administration of insurance license tests by the Division of Insurance, where the division does not pay any money to the testing service.
      Instead, all test fees are paid by the applicants directly to the testing service, and therefore, these fees paid do not fit within the definition of state money.

       Factors considered in determining whether a project constituted “public construction” included: (1) the nature of the contract whether the contract was for the provision of funds or for the construction itself; (2) whether the structure would be used for a public purpose; (3) whether the state would control the structure after construction; (4) whether the state would continue to fund the project after construction; and (5) the relative portion of project financing that the state supplied. Western Alaska Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council v. Inn-Vestment Assocs., 909 P.2d 330 (Alaska 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case involving the question whether involvement of the Alaska Railroad Corporation (ARRC) in a general partnership with private investors for construction of a hotel implicated Alaska’s Little Davis-Bacon Act, evidence was sufficient to conclude that the project was “public construction” where it showed that ARRC undertook significant liability that was of benefit to the investors in obtaining a construction loan, that its involvement in the project was due not only to an investment incentive, but also to its desire to augment its passenger business and further development of the area, that ARRC had pursued investment in hotels in a continuing course of action, and that it wielded substantial power in the functioning of the partnership.

       The coverage of the Little Davis-Bacon Act is broader than the federal Davis-Bacon Act and does not require the worker to be employed directly upon the site of the work. Bd. of Trade, Inc. v. State, DOL, Wage &amp; Hour Admin., 968 P.2d 86 (Alaska 1998).

       For a large public construction project, a property will be considered “on-site” only if it is in close geographic proximity to the project footprint, and such determination will necessarily be fact specific and decided on a case-by-case basis.
