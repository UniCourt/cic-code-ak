       A person may not operate a seafood processing establishment or a seafood processing vessel without a written hazard analysis critical control point plan that explains the procedures used at each critical control point in the operation of the seafood processing establishment or the seafood processing vessel. The department may review, and comment on, the completeness of the hazard analysis critical control point plan prepared for a seafood processing establishment or a seafood processing vessel; however, the department may not require annual submission of the plan unless a change in operation, product, or process necessitates a change in the plan. In this subsection, “critical control point” means a point, step, or procedure in a food process at which control can be applied, and a food safety hazard can as a result be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.

      "(a) The controlled substance prescription database is established in the Board of Pharmacy. The purpose of the database is to contain data as described in this section regarding every prescription for a schedule II, III, or IV controlled substance under federal law dispensed in the state to a person other than those administered to a patient at a health care facility.
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) The pharmacist-in-charge of each licensed or registered pharmacy, regarding each schedule II, III, or IV controlled substance under federal law dispensed by a pharmacist under the supervision of the pharmacist-in-charge, and each practitioner who directly dispenses a schedule II, III, or IV controlled substance under federal law other than those administered to a patient at a health care facility, shall submit to the board, by a procedure and in a format established by the board, the following information for inclusion in the database on at least a weekly basis:
     </p>

      (1) the name of the prescribing practitioner and the practitioner's federal Drug Enforcement Administration registration number or other appropriate identifier;
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) the date of the prescription;
     </p>
     <p>
      (3) the date the prescription was filled and the method of payment; this paragraph does not authorize the board to include individual credit card or other account numbers in the database;
     </p>
     <p>
      (4) the name, address, and date of birth of the person for whom the prescription was written;
     </p>
     <p>
      (5) the name and national drug code of the controlled substance;
     </p>
     <p>
      (d) The database and the information contained within the database are confidential, are not public records, are not subject to public disclosure, and may not be shared with the federal government. The board shall undertake to ensure the security and confidentiality of the database and the information contained within the database. The board may allow access to the database only to the following persons, and in accordance with the limitations provided and regulations of the board:
     </p>
     <p>
      (1) personnel of the board regarding inquiries concerning licensees or registrants of the board or personnel of another board or agency concerning a practitioner under a search warrant, subpoena, or order issued by an administrative law judge or a court;
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) authorized board personnel or contractors as required for operational and review purposes;
     </p>
     <p>
      (3) a licensed practitioner having authority to prescribe controlled substances or an agent or employee of the practitioner whom the practitioner has authorized to access the database on the practitioner's behalf, to the extent the information relates specifically to a current patient of the practitioner to whom the practitioner is prescribing or considering prescribing a controlled substance; the agent or employee must be licensed or registered under AS 08;
     </p>
     <p>
      (4) a licensed or registered pharmacist having authority to dispense controlled substances or an agent or employee of the pharmacist whom the pharmacist has authorized to access the database on the pharmacist's behalf, to the extent the information relates specifically to a current patient to whom the pharmacist is dispensing or considering dispensing a controlled substance; the agent or employee must be licensed or registered under AS 08;
     </p>
     <p>
      (5) state and local law enforcement authorities may receive printouts of information contained in the database under a search warrant or order issued by a court establishing probable cause for the access and use of the information;
     </p>
     <p>
      (6) an individual who is the recipient of a controlled substance prescription entered into the database may receive information contained in the database concerning the individual on providing evidence satisfactory to the board that the individual requesting the information is in fact the person about whom the data entry was made and on payment of a fee set by the board under

     </p>
     <p>
      (p) The board shall promptly notify the State Medical Board, the Board of Nursing, the Board of Dental Examiners, and the Board of Examiners in Optometry when a practitioner registers with the database under (o) of this section.

        Disclosure of information as to debilitating conditions. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska’s medical marijuana law does not require medical marijuana users to divulge any details about the debilitating conditions they suffer, and although it does require them to register and to identify their approving physicians, the law explicitly requires the department to keep the registry confidential; therefore, the law’s confidential registration process does not violate the constitutional right to privacy.

      <p>
       Special condition of probation that prohibited defendant from possessing, applying for, or obtaining a medical marijuana card, which directly impacted his constitutional right to make independent medical choices in consultation with a physician, was vacated as it was not narrowly tailored to the superior court’s stated purpose that defendant be clean and sober when he was evaluated for substance abuse and mental health issues, nor did it appear that the superior court affirmatively considered less restrictive alternatives to the categorical prohibition it imposed.
