       The purpose of a prohibition such as contained in this section is to eliminate any hope in the mind of the legislator that an office created while he is a member of the legislature may be filled by himself, and to insure to the people independent judgment of their representatives.

      <p>
       It is necessary to good government that legislators exercise their judgment free from selfish motives and, to this end, prohibitions such as contained in this section have been placed in constitutions and on statute books.

      Under § 2, 2006 General Election Ballot Measure No. 1, § 1 of the initiative, adding subsection (b), is to “[take] effect on the first day of the Second Regular Session of the 25th Alaska Legislature.”
      Under
      article XI, section 6, Constitution of the State of Alaska, “[a]n initiated law becomes effective ninety days after certification” of the election results by the lieutenant governor.
      The lieutenant governor certified the results of the 2006 general election on December 5, 2006, thereby giving 2006 General Election Ballot Measure No. 1 an actual effective date of March 5, 2007.
      It is possible, however, that § 2, 2006 General Election Ballot Measure No. 1 will be interpreted as an applicability section, in which case subsection (b) will not apply until the first day of the Second Regular Session of the 25th Alaska State Legislature.

      The Alaska Legislative Council is established as a permanent interim committee and service agency of the legislature.
      The establishment of the council recognizes the need of the legislature for full-time technical assistance in accomplishing the research, reporting, bill drafting, and examination and revision of statutes, and general administrative services essential to the development of sound legislation in the public interest.

      A legislator may not be held to answer before any other tribunal for any statement made in the exercise of legislative duties while the legislature is in session.
      A member attending, going to, or returning from legislative sessions is not subject to civil process and is privileged from arrest except for felony or breach of the peace. The immunities provided in this section extend to a legislator attending, going to, or returning from a meeting of an interim standing or special committee of the legislature of which the legislator is a member.
      For the purposes of going to and returning from a session or meeting, the immunities provided extend to a legislator for a period of five days immediately preceding and following the legislator’s attendance at the session or meeting.

     <p>
      The legislature finds and declares that the operation of responsible representative democracy requires that the fullest opportunity be afforded to the people to petition their government for the redress of grievances and to express freely to individual members of the legislature, to its committees, and to officials of the executive branch, their opinions on pending legislation or administrative actions; and that the people are entitled to know the identity, income, expenditures, and activities of those persons who pay, are paid or reimbursed for expenses, or who make expenditures or other payments in an effort to influence legislative or administrative action.

The lieutenant governor communicated her determination to that effect to the initiative sponsors by letter dated May 29, 1996. See also May 21, 1996 Op. Att’y Gen.

       high moral and ethical standards among public servants in the legislative branch of government are essential to assure the trust, respect, and confidence of the people of this state;
      </li>
      <li id="t24c60a01s24.60.010ol12">
       a fair and open government requires that legislators and legislative employees conduct the public’s business in a manner that preserves the integrity of the legislative process and avoids conflicts of interest or even appearances of conflicts of interest;
      </li>
      <li id="t24c60a01s24.60.010ol13">
       the public’s commitment to a part-time citizen legislature requires legislators be drawn from all parts of society and the best way to attract competent people is to acknowledge that they provide their time and energy to the state, often at substantial personal and financial sacrifice;
      </li>
      <li id="t24c60a01s24.60.010ol14">
       a part-time citizen legislature implies that legislators are expected and permitted to earn outside income and that the rules governing legislators’ conduct during and after leaving public service must be clear, fair, and as complete as possible; the rules, however, should not impose unreasonable or unnecessary burdens that will discourage citizens from entering or staying in government service;
      </li>
      <li id="t24c60a01s24.60.010ol15">
       in order for the rules governing conduct to be respected both during and after leaving public service, the code must be administered fairly without bias or favoritism;
      </li>
      <li id="t24c60a01s24.60.010ol16">
       no code of conduct, however comprehensive, can anticipate all situations in which violations may occur nor can it prescribe behaviors that are appropriate to every situation; in addition, laws and regulations regarding ethical responsibilities cannot legislate morality, eradicate corruption, or eliminate bad judgment;
      </li>
      <li id="t24c60a01s24.60.010ol17">
       compliance with a code of ethics is an individual responsibility; thus all who serve the legislature have a solemn responsibility to avoid improper conduct and prevent improper behavior by colleagues and subordinates;

       the purpose of this chapter is to establish standards of conduct for state legislators and legislative employees and to establish the Select Committee on Legislative Ethics to consider alleged violations of this chapter and to render advisory opinions to persons affected by this chapter;

       Alaska legislature clearly knows how to establish a duty to disclose and has done so in several instances. Its failure to include an explicit duty to disclose in subsection (e)(3) is significant; reading
       AS 24.60 as a whole, it would be inappropriate to imply a duty to disclose matters within the ambit of (e)(3).

The committee shall upon request provide a form for a complaint to a person wishing to file a complaint. Upon receiving a complaint, the committee shall advise the complainant that the committee or the subject of the complaint may ask the complainant to testify at any stage of the proceeding as to the complainant’s belief that the subject of the complaint has violated this chapter.

The staff recommendation shall be based on the information and evidence contained in the complaint as supplemented by the complainant and by the subject of the complaint, if requested to do so by the staff member. The committee shall consider the recommendation of the staff member, if any, and shall determine whether the allegations of the complaint, if true, constitute a violation of this chapter. If the committee determines that the allegations, if proven, would not give rise to a violation, that the complaint is frivolous on its face, that there is insufficient credible information that can be uncovered to warrant further investigation by the committee, or that the committee’s lack of jurisdiction is apparent on the face of the complaint, the committee shall dismiss the complaint and shall notify the complainant and the subject of the complaint of the dismissal. The committee may ask the complainant to provide clarification or additional information before it makes a decision under this subsection and may request information concerning the matter from the subject of the complaint.

A copy of this resolution shall be provided to the complainant and to the subject of the complaint.

The committee shall issue a decision explaining its dismissal. Committee deliberations and vote on the dismissal order and decision are not open to the public or to the subject of the complaint.

Within 20 days after receiving the opinion, the subject of the complaint may request a confidential meeting with the committee at which meeting the committee shall explain the reasons for its recommendations. The committee may divulge confidential information to the subject of the complaint. The information remains confidential. The subject of the complaint may comply with the opinion or may request a hearing before the committee under (j) of this section. After the hearing, the committee may amend or affirm the opinion. If the subject of the complaint agrees to comply with the opinion but later fails to complete the corrective action in a timely manner, the committee may formally charge the person as provided in (h) of this section or may refer the matter to the appropriate house of the legislature, in the case of a legislator, or, in the case of a legislative employee, to the employee’s appointing authority. The appropriate house of the legislature or the appointing authority, as appropriate, may take action to enforce the corrective action or may decline to take action and refer the matter to the committee.

The charge shall be served on the person charged, in a manner consistent with the service of summons under the rules of civil procedure, and a copy of the charge shall be sent to the complainant.

       When the committee has a complaint concerning the conduct of a candidate for state office pending before it at the beginning of a campaign period that has not resulted in the issuance of formal charges under (h) of this section, the committee may proceed with its consideration of the complaint only to the extent that the committee’s actions are confidential under this section. The committee may not, during a campaign period, issue a dismissal order or decision under (f) of this section, issue an opinion under (g) of this section, or formally charge a person under (h) of this section. If the committee has formally charged a person under (h) of this section and the charge is still pending when a campaign period begins, the committee shall suspend any public hearings on the matter until after the campaign period ends. The parties to the hearing may continue with discovery during the campaign period. If a hearing has been completed before the beginning of a campaign period but the committee has not yet issued its decision, the committee may not issue the decision until after the end of the campaign period. Notwithstanding the suspension of public proceedings provided for in this subsection, a candidate who is the subject of a complaint may notify the committee in writing that the candidate chooses to have the committee proceed with the complaint under this section.

       A campaign period under this section begins on the later of 45 days before a primary election in which the legislator or legislative employee is a candidate for state office or the day on which the individual files as a candidate for state office and ends at the close of election day for the general or special election in which the individual is a candidate or on the day that the candidate withdraws from the election, if earlier. For a candidate who loses in the primary election, the campaign period ends on the day that results of the primary election showing that another individual won the election are certified.

       At any point in the proceedings when the subject of a complaint appears before the committee, the subject of a complaint may choose to be accompanied by legal counsel or another person who may also present arguments before the committee. The choice of counsel or another person is not subject to review and approval or disapproval by the committee. The choice by the subject of a complaint to be accompanied under this subsection does not constitute a waiver of any confidentiality provision in this chapter.
