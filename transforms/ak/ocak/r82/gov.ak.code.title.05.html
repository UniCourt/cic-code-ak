If social security numbers are voluntarily provided by persons completing reports to the division, disclosure of those documents is not prohibited so long as the documents are normally subject to public review. However, if those completing reports are required to provide social security numbers, they may not be disclosed unless the state has complied with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. § 552a.

      A political entity could obtain a permit for and conduct bingo or pull-tab games, but it could not use any of the proceeds for general operating funds, or for any purpose connected to the entity’s objectives. For all purposes, there is virtually nothing that a political entity could do for itself with funds raised from the conduct of charitable games other than raffles and lotteries. A political entity could, though, raise funds using pull-tabs or bingo and donate these in their entirety to an eleemosynary organization or a municipality. May 16, 1997 Op. Att’y Gen.

      Within first amendment restrictions, the state may prohibit the broadcasting of gaming activities or advertisements, but there are serious concerns, from an equal protection standpoint, with any proposal that would allow one particular group or organization to conduct or advertise game activities on the air while excluding all others. May 4, 1990 Op. Att’y Gen.

     <p>
      On its face, ch. 33, SLA 1990 does not appear to be constitutionally invalid because it only creates a possibility that the Department of Commerce and Economic Development (now Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development) will allow noncommercial broadcasting stations to conduct gaming to the exclusion of other organizations. If the department does allow this, then the department must be able to justify the distinction between the two types of organizations, and the analyses set out in the opinion should be used.

      Formerly AS 05.15.210. Renumbered in 1994. Reorganized in 1983 to alphabetize the defined terms and in 1986, 1988, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2012, and 2014 to maintain alphabetical order. In 1994, in the definition of “vendor” “the business” was deleted from the beginning of (C) and “an establishment holding a” was deleted from the beginning of (C)(ii), to correct a manifest error in § 36,

      the commissioner [now department] has authority to further limit the number of activities which may be conducted pursuant to any permit.
      Therefore, absent any regulation to the contrary, a permit could be issued for more than one activity to a qualified organization. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 8.

      That the term “lottery” as used in item (29) (now (41)) of this section does not include an ice pool is indicated by the express provisions of item (18) (now (26)). 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 8.
     </p>
     <p>
      While the conduct of an ice pool might come within the definition of a lottery, by the language in item (29) (now (41)) of this section, the legislature has limited a lottery to a game conducted by a drawing for prizes. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 8.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the term lottery in item (29) (now (41)) of this section was meant to include an ice classic, then item (18) (now (26)) would be meaningless. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 8.
     </p>
     <p>
      While there may have been other ice pools conducted prior to the date of this section, the language of item (18) (now (26)) showed that the legislature intended to authorize only two pools, the Nenana and Chena, and none other. 1960 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 8.

      “Ice classics” are not exempt from the provisions of this title regulating games of chance generally.

     <p>
      By designating specific organizations to operate the Big Lake Ice Classic, HB 323 [ch. 22, SLA 1990] might violate the constitutional prohibition against local and special legislation since Alaska Const., art. II, § 19, provides in part, “The legislature shall pass no local or special act if a general act can be made applicable. April 17, 1990 Op. Att’y Gen.

      Promotional latex game tickets constituted pull-tab games under this chapter even though an “information product” containing information about an arctic animal was attached to the game piece and free game pieces could be obtained by mailing a request to the company, since the company’s primary business was selling the game cards and the tickets had a prize structure much like traditional pull-tab games.

      , the owner of a boat is liable for injury or damage caused by the negligent operation of the owner’s boat whether the negligence consists of a violation of a state statute or the failure to exercise ordinary care in the operation of the boat as the rules of the common law require. The owner is not liable, however, unless the boat is used with the owner’s express or implied consent. It is presumed that the boat is being operated with the knowledge and consent of the owner if, at the time of the injury or damage, it is under the control of the owner’s spouse, father, mother, brother, sister, son, daughter, or other member of the owner’s immediate family. This chapter does not relieve any other person from a liability that the person would otherwise incur and does not authorize or permit recovery in excess of injury or damage actually incurred.

A plan of operation must include written provisions for ski patrol, avalanche control, avalanche rescue, grooming procedures, tramway evacuation, hazard marking, missing person procedures, and first aid. Before the operation of the ski area for that season, the plan shall be reviewed and approved by the commissioner of natural resources except that if an agency of the United States manages the land on which the ski area operates, the plan shall be reviewed and approved by that agency. The commissioner of natural resources may require a ski area operator to pay a fee not to exceed the department’s cost of reviewing the plan, and may adopt regulations to implement this subsection.

       A skier is responsible for knowing the range of the skier’s own ability to negotiate a ski slope or trail and to ski within the limits of the skier’s ability. A skier is responsible for an injury to a person or property resulting from an inherent danger and risk of skiing, except that a skier is not precluded under this chapter from suing another skier for an injury to person or property resulting from the other skier’s acts or omissions. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the risk of a skier’s collision with another skier is not an inherent danger or risk of skiing in an action by one skier against another.

      <li id="t05c45s05.45.100ol1b">
       A skier has the duty to maintain control of the skier’s speed and course at all times when skiing and to maintain a proper lookout so as to be able to avoid other skiers and objects. However, a person skiing downhill has the primary duty to avoid collision with a person or object below the skier.
