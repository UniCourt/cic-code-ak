     When the various articles of the state law providing for the administration, management, and conservation of fish and wildlife became effective, acts of Congress on the same subject were no longer of any force. Metlakatla Indian Community v. Egan, 362 P.2d 901 (Alaska 1961), vacated in part, 369 U.S. 45, 82 S. Ct. 552, 7 L. Ed. 2d 562 (U.S. 1962), aff'd in part, 369 U.S. 60, 82 S. Ct. 562, 7 L.

     There is no intimation in the Alaska Statehood Act of an intent that any United States administration under the commercial fishery laws be carried out after the state had been certified as capable of its own management. Metlakatla Indian Community v. Egan, 362 P.2d 901 (Alaska 1961), vacated in part, 369 U.S. 45, 82 S. Ct. 552, 7 L. Ed. 2d 562 (U.S. 1962), aff'd in part, 369 U.S. 60, 82 S. Ct. 562, 7 L.

     Upon Alaska’s admission on January 3, 1959, the Alaska game laws and acts regulating commercial fisheries as “territorial laws” continued in force, but were modified by Ordinance No. 3 of the state constitution prohibiting the use of fish traps for the taking of salmon for commercial purposes and by the Alaska Constitution, art. VIII, § 15, providing that “no exclusive right or special privilege of fishery shall be created or authorized in the natural waters of the State.” They were further modified by the enactment by the first state legislature of a law making it unlawful to erect, moor, or maintain fish traps (SLA 1959, ch. 17), and by a later enactment (SLA 1959, ch. 95) making it unlawful to operate fish traps and prescribing penalties therefor.

     The federal regulations in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.A. §§ 1801-1883, are not intended to supplant applicable state regulations. The federal law is intended to be a concurrent regulation of the sablefish fishery in Alaska waters, not an exercise of exclusive control; therefore, defendant was obligated to conform his conduct to both the federal and the state sablefish regulations.

       The commissioner had authority to issue an exploratory permit for the purpose of conducting a test fishery; financing the operation through an agreement with a private fisher that allowed the fisher to finance an exploratory fishing operation by allowing a private contractor to sell the catch did not constitute “commercial fishing.” Kodiak Seafood Processors Ass'n v.

       The commissioner’s issuance of an exploratory permit to conduct a research trip to determine the abundance of scallops and crab bycatch in limited areas of closed waters for the purpose of developing a scallop management plan was not an abuse of discretion.

     <p>
      The department shall avoid destruction of nuisance moose if a practicable alternative exists for the relocation of the moose to suitable habitat where the moose will not be a nuisance. The commissioner may authorize one or more private individuals or groups to relocate nuisance moose to suitable habitat designated by the department if, upon review and evaluation of a written application and proposal, the commissioner finds that the individual or group is qualified to relocate nuisance moose without undue danger to the public, themselves, or the moose. Before relocating nuisance moose, an authorized individual or group shall provide financial assurances acceptable to the commissioner that will cover the state’s reasonable anticipated costs of the relocation and indemnify the state for liability for damages to private persons and property arising from the actions of the individual or group in relocating nuisance moose under this section. The authorized individual or group shall reimburse the state for its costs that arise from relocating nuisance moose. A civil action to recover damages or costs that arise from relocating nuisance moose may not be brought against the state or a political subdivision, officer, or employee of the state. If darts containing narcotics are used to tranquilize moose, all of the darts shall be recovered and properly disposed. In this section, “nuisance moose” means moose designated by the department in an area of concentrated human population that pose a significant risk to the health, safety, or economic well-being of persons in the area.

      There is no reason why the Department of Fish and Game could not issue different categories of emergency orders under this section in cases of, for example, true biological emergency, and possible “field” orders for other situations, although it would be advisable to adopt a regulation describing how the department intends to apply this section.
      Also, it probably would be advisable for clarity’s sake to include the statutory cite in the title of the order — “AS

      The dedication under this section was created subsequent to the date of the ratification of the Alaska Constitution, art. IX, § 7; hence, there was no protection for the fund under the grandfather clause.
      However, the fund was protected by the fact that federal law requires dedication of fishing and hunting license proceeds. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 14.

Before establishing or amending the schedule of bail amounts required by this subsection, the supreme court shall appoint and consult with an advisory committee consisting of two law enforcement officers of the Department of Public Safety engaged in fish and wildlife protection, two representatives of the Department of Fish and Game, two district court judges, and the chairpersons of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees of the legislature.

      This section is tailored carefully to art. I, § 14, of the Alaska Constitution and is therefore valid. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 15.
     </p>
     <p>
      Requiring a written signed statement of the reason for the search is objectionable but valid.
      It is objectionable because it unnecessarily ties the hands of the field agents charged with enforcement of the fish and game laws, and is a provision which is quite uncommon, if not unique.
      1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 15.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is no constitutional requirement that all searches be with warrant, and reasonable searches may be made without warrant. A reasonable search is one made (a) upon probable cause that fruits of a crime or evidence relating to the crime will be found; (b) under circumstances which would make the securing of a warrant impracticable. 1961 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 19.
     </p>
     <p>
      A search may be made pursuant to a valid arrest, providing that the arrest is made prior to the search. 1961 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 19.
     </p>
     <p>
      The statutory requirement that fish and game agents fill out a form stating the objects of search will not make an otherwise invalid search valid, but it may invalidate an otherwise valid search if not complied with. 1961 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 15.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the case of a vessel, the limits of the area open to search probably include the entire vessel. 1961 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 19.

       The standards of due process under the Alaska and federal constitutions require that a deprivation of property be accompanied by notice and opportunity for hearing at a meaningful time to minimize possible injury. F/V Am. Eagle v. State, 620 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the seized property is used by its owner in earning a livelihood, notice and an unconditioned opportunity to contest the state’s reasons for seizing the property must follow the seizure within days, if not hours, to satisfy due process guarantees even where the government interest in the seizure is urgent. F/V Am. Eagle v. State, 620 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Due process does not require that any owner of a vessel seized by the state for suspected use in illegal activity has an absolute right to obtain release of the property upon the posting of an adequate bond.
       To permit this would frustrate one purpose of forfeitures, which is to prevent possible use of the property in further illicit acts. F/V Am. Eagle v. State, 620 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The State was not liable for federal or state constitutional violations, or for common-law conversion, for its ex parte seizure and retention of defendant’s fishing boat during a criminal prosecution and civil in rem forfeiture action, and although the seizure was based on an erroneous criminal charge, due process required no more than a prompt postseizure hearing.

       In case of forfeiture, the decree of the court acts upon the thing itself and binds the interest of all the world, whether any party actually appears or not.
       If it is condemned, the title of the property is completely changed, and the new title acquired by the forfeiture travels with the thing in all its future progress. United States v. Pollastrine, 8 Alaska 104 (D. Alaska 1929) (decided under prior law).

        Purposes for forfeiture. —
       </b>

        Strict construction against government. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       As a general rule, forfeitures are disfavored by the law, and thus forfeiture statutes should be strictly construed against the government. F/V Am. Eagle v. State, 620 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Due process requirements. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The standards of due process under the Alaska and federal constitutions require that a deprivation of property be accompanied by notice and opportunity for hearing at a meaningful time to minimize possible injury. F/V Am. Eagle v. State, 620 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the seized property is used by its owner in earning a livelihood, notice and an unconditioned opportunity to contest the state’s reasons for seizing the property must follow the seizure within days, if not hours, to satisfy due process guarantees even where the government interest in the seizure is urgent. F/V Am. Eagle v. State, 620 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Due process does not require that any owner of a vessel seized by the state for suspected use in illegal activity has an absolute right to obtain release of the property upon the posting of an adequate bond.
       To permit this would frustrate one purpose of forfeitures, which is to prevent possible use of the property in further illicit acts. F/V Am. Eagle v. State, 620 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the seizure of a fishing vessel is authorized by a judicially approved warrant issued upon probable cause and the state files a civil complaint on the next working day following the seizure, and the owners are promptly notified, the owners are afforded procedural due process. State v. F/V Baranof, 677 P.2d 1245 (Alaska), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 823, 105 S. Ct. 98, 83 L. Ed. 2d 43 (U.S. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       The State was not liable for federal or state constitutional violations, or for common-law conversion, for its ex parte seizure and retention of defendant’s fishing boat during a criminal prosecution and civil in rem forfeiture action, and although the seizure was based on an erroneous criminal charge, due process required no more than a prompt postseizure hearing.

       After defendant was convicted of knowingly supplying his clients with bait and tackle that was prohibited in Fish Creek, forfeiture of his boat and motors was authorized because when he used them to transport his clients to the site of the illegal fishing, he was using them in aid of his intended offense.

       <b>
        Effect of stipulation agreement. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the rules of admiralty, once a stipulation for value is posted with the court, the once-seized vessel is free from re-arrest in the same action. F/V Am. Eagle v. State, 620 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Stipulation agreements for the value of a vessel constitute an agreement with the court, involving substitution of a chose in action against the owner in place of the vessel sued in rem. The bond filed becomes the res which alone is sufficient to give the court in rem jurisdiction. F/V Am. Eagle v. State, 620 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The superior court did not err in relying on the general rules of admiralty law in holding that the stipulated bond served as a complete substitute for the res, thereby limiting the state’s recovery to that bond, rather than a form of bail in order to allow for the temporary release of the vessel only. F/V Am. Eagle v. State, 620 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Amount of stipulation bond. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent fraud, mistake, or duress, the amount of the stipulation bond will not be raised even though the value of the vessel increases. F/V Am. Eagle v. State, 620 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Forfeiture of bond. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The superior court did not err in allowing the owners of a vessel to forfeit the $350,000 bond they posted, rather than requiring the forfeiture of the vessel itself, or ordering an increase in the value of the bond to reflect a rise in the vessel’s appraised value subsequent to the stipulation whereby the vessel was released. F/V Am. Eagle v. State, 620 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the violations alleged involved taking for commercial profit a crucial biological resource of the state, the existence of which depends on careful regulation of harvest, forfeiture of the bond and sale proceeds of the illegal taking was not an abuse of the superior court’s discretion. F/V Am. Eagle v. State, 620 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Statutory provisions for remission. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska’s forfeiture statute only allows for remission when an innocent buyer subsequently purchases, in good faith, property subject to forfeiture.
       It makes no provision for remission to an innocent owner or security holder. State v. Rice, 626 P.2d 104 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Remission to innocent nonnegligent third parties. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where property is forfeited under this section, if an innocent nonnegligent third party can show the manner in which the property came into possession of the violator and that prior to parting with the property he did not know, nor have reasonable cause to believe, either that the property would be used to violate the law, or that the violator had a criminal record or a reputation for commercial crime, substantive due process under the Alaska Constitution requires that a procedure be available for remission of the forfeited item. State v. Rice, 626 P.2d 104 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the state files an action pursuant to this section for forfeiture of property, a remission procedure is mandated under the Alaska Constitution, since not to allow innocent owners and security holders to show that they have not been involved in the criminal activity that triggered the forfeiture proceeding violates Alaska’s constitutional due process provision. State v. Rice, 626 P.2d 104 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       An innocent holder of an interest in the seized airplane which did all it could reasonably be expected to do was deprived of its constitutional rights to substantive due process through the failure of the statutory scheme relating to forfeitures to provide for remission of the interests of innocent nonnegligent third parties in the forfeited item. State v. Rice, 626 P.2d 104 (Alaska 1981).

      <p>
       The power of the Board of Fisheries to control fishery resource utilization allows it to allocate the salmon harvest between two competing subgroups of commercial users by a regulation requiring a salmon fisherman who wishes to transfer from one district to another in a bay to register in the new district at least 48 hours before transferring, and to cease fishing in any district during the 48-hour period, which burdens mobile driftnetters more than setnetters.

      <p>
       The Board of Fisheries possessed the authority to allocate Pacific Salmon Treaty chinook between sport and commercial users, since the Board’s allocation decision was not a limitation or admission to a particular user group and was not violative of the “common use” or “no exclusive right of fishery” clauses of Article VIII of the Alaska Constitution.

       The development of a mixed stock policy involves the fisheries board’s expertise, and therefore the courts review the regulation for a reasonable basis. Native Village of Elim v. State, 990 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1999).

        Proposed initiative held unconstitutional. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Proposed ballot initiative that would ban commercial set net fishing in nonsubsistence areas violates the Alaska Constitution because it effects a prohibited appropriation via initiative; it would have resulted in a give-away program of salmon stock from set netters to other types of fishers, and it would have significantly narrowed the Alaska Legislature’s and Alaska Board of Fisheries’ range of freedom to make allocation decisions.

        Intergroup allocations. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the Alaska Board of Fisheries has the statutory authority to allocate fishery resources among personal use, sport, guided sport, and commercial fisheries, the Board is not precluded from making intragroup allocations within those general categories. Therefore, in an initiative dispute, it was error to conclude that the relevant user group was “commercial fishers” as a whole instead of the subset of commercial fishers who used set nets.

      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether a regulation is authorized by statute the Court of Appeals of Alaska looks to four things:
       First, the scope of authority conferred by the authorizing statute; second, the extent to which the regulation is in accordance with “standards prescribed by other provisions of law”; third, the extent to which the regulation is consistent with the authorizing statute; and fourth, the extent to which the regulation is reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose of the authorizing statute. Beran v. State, 705 P.2d 1280 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislature authorized the Alaska Board of Fisheries to enact regulations that allow the Department of Fish and Game to establish harvest limits through the permitting process; the Board was given the authority to control or supervise all facets of fishing, and the Legislature has given the Board the authority to enact regulations providing for the issuance of subsistence permits as needed for authorizing, regulating, and monitoring the subsistence harvest of fish.

      <p>
       The boards of fisheries and game have the discretion to adopt regulations that recognize the needs, customs, and traditions of Alaska residents, but they are not mandated to do so when formulating their subsistence regulations. State v. Morry, 836 P.2d 358 (Alaska 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Board of Fisheries has authority to ban fish spotting if such a ban is properly based on conservation, development, or allocation goals. Alaska Fish Spotters Ass'n v. State, Dep't of Fish &amp; Game, 838 P.2d 798 (Alaska 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Recognition of user groups defined by use of a particular means or method of access would not be in accordance with the views of the framers of Alaska’s constitution and would needlessly impair the board of fisheries’ power and duty to control utilization, development, and conservation of fisheries resources for maximum public benefit.

       In affirming the grant of summary judgment to the state in a management team’s challenge to 5 AAC 85.045, the court determined that the regulation violated neither the sustained yield principle of Alaska Const. art. VIII, § 4, nor this section and 16.05.258; the Board of Game acted within its discretion in adopting the regulation that allowed for the issuance of “up to” 400 hunting permits in a controlled use area because creating a controlled use area did not necessarily amount to designating a relevant animal population for management purposes, and it was reasonable not to manage moose in the region as a distinct game population.

        Rural residency requirement unconstitutional. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement contained in the 1986 subsistence statute (ch. 52, SLA 1986), that one must reside in a rural area in order to participate in subsistence hunting and fishing, violates Alaska Const., art. VIII, §§ 3, 15, and 17. McDowell v. State, 785 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1989).

        Prohibition of subsistence permits for residents in nonsubsistence areas invalid. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The requirements of the equal access clauses apply to both tiers of subsistence users. Just as eligibility to participate in all subsistence hunting and fishing cannot be made dependent on whether one lives in an urban or rural area, eligibility to participate in Tier II subsistence hunting and fishing cannot be based on how close one lives to a given fish or game population. Subsection (b)(4)(B)(ii), which uses the proximity of the domicile of the Tier II subsistence permit applicant to the fish or game population which the applicant wishes to harvest as a basis for the applicant’s eligibility, violates sections 3, 15, and 17 of article VIII of the Alaska Constitution.

        Creation of nonsubsistence areas not unconstitutional. —

      <p>
       The statutory provision in subsection (c) mandating the creation of nonsubsistence areas does not violate sections 3, 15, and 17 of article VIII of the Alaska Constitution because the provision by itself without the proximity of domicile provisions does not absolutely bar subsistence uses for certain residents.

       The boards of fisheries and game have the discretion to adopt regulations that recognize the needs, customs, and traditions of Alaska residents, but they are not mandated to do so when formulating their subsistence regulations. State v. Morry, 836 P.2d 358 (Alaska 1992).

      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of the Alaska Joint Boards of Fisheries and Game to use large nonsubsistence starting areas or even to combine two proposed areas did not exceed their discretion; although the boundaries encompassed relatively large areas, an “area or community” as the words are used in subsection (c) of this section may encompass several subdistricts grouped together.

      <p>
       The term “sustained yield” in subsection (b) is potentially broad enough to include authority in the game board to restrict even subsistence hunting in order to rebuild a damaged game population.
       However, the board does not have absolute discretion in this area.
       There must be a balance of minimum adverse impact upon rural residents who depend upon subsistence use of resources and recognized scientific principles of game management. Kwethluk IRA Council v. Alaska, 740 F. Supp. 765 (D. Alaska 1990).

The subsistence law provides a preference only by giving subsistence users “reasonable opportunity” to harvest the resource, and the superior court erred in its decision that the least intrusive standard was implied as a rule of construction for the term “reasonable opportunity.” State v.

       Legislature authorized the Board of Fisheries to enact regulations that allow the Department of Fish and Game to establish harvest limits through the permitting process; where the fish population is an important subsistence resource, but the subsistence harvest is too great to maintain a sustained yield from the population, the Board is required to enact regulations that prohibit all non-subsistence use of the population and impose tailored restrictions on the subsistence harvest.

      <p>
       Summary judgment in favor of the Department of Fish of Game. upholding regulations promulgated by the Alaska Board of Game, managing caribou hunting, was proper because considerable evidence justified the Board’s “amount reasonably necessary for subsistence” calculation; the Board reasonably concluded that there was a reasonable opportunity for subsistence uses, and managing the Nelchina caribou hunt was consistent with the statute and was reasonable and not arbitrary.

       Superior court properly granted the Alaska Board of Game summary judgment upholding its regulations managing caribou hunting because considerable evidence justified the Board’s “amount reasonably necessary for subsistence” calculation and demonstrated that it took a hard look at the salient problems and engaged in reasoned decision making; the Board reasonably concluded that there was a reasonable opportunity for subsistence uses, and managing the caribou hunt was consistent with the statute.

       Superior court properly denied a citizen's motion to amend his complaint to challenge the constitutionality of subsection (c) because addition of the claim would be futile since the supreme court rejected the argument over 20 years ago. Manning v. State, 420 P.3d 1270 (Alaska 2018).

      <p>
       Superior court properly denied a citizen's motion to amend his complaint to allege that the conditions required to receive a community harvest permit violated the federal and State equal protection clauses and the State equal access clauses on the ground that amendment would be futile because the community hunt permit condition did not implicate either equal protection or the equal access clauses. Manning v. State, 420 P.3d 1270 (Alaska 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Community harvest permit condition applies equally to all Alaskans, does not meaningfully limit admission to the user group, and does not discriminate between user groups; all Alaskans are eligible for a community harvest permit; the only requirements are finding a group of other hunters with whom to collaborate and complying with the “applicable customary and traditional use pattern”, and any inconvenience these requirements may pose does not implicate constitutional rights. Manning v. State, 420 P.3d 1270 (Alaska 2018).

      <p>
       Board of game regulations establishing seasons and bag limits on the taking of moose and caribou were arbitrary and invalid, where the board did not follow or articulate its use of the statutory analytical process for adopting bag limits as to subsistence hunting, and the regulations imposed seasons not consistent with the board’s findings as to established village customs and thereby unacceptably restricted the statutory preference for subsistence uses. Bobby v. Alaska, 718 F. Supp. 764 (D. Ala. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trophy hunting regulations adopted by the board of game do not constitute compliance with the requirement of subsection (c) that the board adopt subsistence hunting regulations for game. State v. Morry, 836 P.2d 358 (Alaska 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where no hearing was ever held regarding whether regulations of the board of game were consistent with the subsistence law prior to their adoption as subsistence regulations, the challenged tag/fee and sealing regulations, as subsistence regulations applicable to the taking and use of brown/grizzly bears in the affected game management units, were invalid. State v. Morry, 836 P.2d 358 (Alaska 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Charges against certain fishermen for violating the limits placed on subsistence fishing permits were dismissed because the Department of Fish and Game’s failure to comply with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act when it promulgated the harvest limits rendered them inapplicable where the core characteristics of a regulation were present, the fishermen’s activities were restricted by the addition of specific, concrete content to the general rule, the public was not provided the participation required by statute, and the limit was first announced after it was adopted, in a letter the Department sent to community leaders.

      The boards shall set the number and terms of each of the members of the advisory committees, shall delegate one member of each committee as chairman, and shall give the chairman authority to hold public hearings on fish or game matters. Recommendations from the advisory committees shall be forwarded to the appropriate board for their consideration but if the Board of Fisheries or the Board of Game chooses not to follow the recommendations of the local advisory committee the appropriate board shall inform the appropriate advisory committee of this action and state the reasons for not following the recommendations.
      The commissioner shall delegate authority to advisory committees for emergency closures during established seasons.
      The commissioner is empowered to set aside and make null and void only opening of seasons set by the advisory committees under this section. The appropriate board shall adopt the necessary regulations governing these closures.

      For discussion of compatibility of state local-participation law with local-participation standards of Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. § 3115 et seq.), see 1981 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 11.

      This section does not preclude a board from “determining” the necessity for submitting plans and specifications by regulation rather than on a case-by-case basis. March 4, 1982 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under this section, it is probably possible for the Board of Game to create an advisory committee for marine mammals, and the committee might be able to have some limited emergency closing authority by delegation from the commissioner. However, although state law regarding delegation to private entities is not entirely clear, it is probably impermissible for the board to delegate carte blanche discretionary authority to an advisory committee to adopt regulations. Mar. 14, 1988 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      A marine mammal advisory committee could develop a management plan, which should then, if approved, be adopted by the board by regulation. The commissioner probably could enter into a cooperative agreement with the committee to help administer the plan. Mar. 14, 1988 Op. Att’y Gen.

        “Previously purchased.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       District court erred in allowing both sides to offer their own definitions of the term “previously purchased” because it had a duty to resolve the question of statutory interpretation and instruct the jury on the definition; defendant was entitled to reversal of his convictions for knowingly aiding a client in taking a brown bear without a valid nonresident big game tag and tampering with a public record for falsifying the client's big game hunt and tag records to indicate he had a valid tag. Kinmon v. State, 451 P.3d 392 (Alaska Ct. App. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Delivery of the tag with a binding promise to pay is sufficient to qualify as a “previous purchase” under the statute; construing the statute this way is in accord with the rule of lenity and ensures that licensed big game guides are on notice of the prohibited conduct. Kinmon v. State, 451 P.3d 392 (Alaska Ct. App. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's argument regarding the ambiguous meaning of “previously purchased” was moot as to his convictions for knowingly guiding a client on a hunt without a valid nonresident tag and/or harvest ticket, failing to report the illegal hunt, and tampering with a public record for falsifying the client's hunt and tag records because the jury was faced with a choice between the client's testimony that he did not fill out the paperwork or pay for the tag, and defendant's testimony that he did. Kinmon v. State, 451 P.3d 392 (Alaska Ct. App. 2019).

      The state can require an Alaska resident to have a guide if there is a sufficient factual basis to support the need for residents to be accompanied by a guide. Mar. 14, 1988 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, the validity of big game guide requirements is premised upon the need to protect public resources and the hunting public. Hazards of rugged terrain, dangerous animals, and inclement weather have also been raised as justifications for requiring hunters to be accompanied by guides. Similarly, the need to protect public resources from hunters unfamiliar with state conservation laws has also been cited as a basis for requiring a guide. Mar. 14, 1988 Op. Att’y Gen.

      A member of the military who claims Alaska residency, and who is transferred to another state, may be allowed to obtain a “resident” rather than a “nonresident” hunting or fishing license in that state, based upon the service member’s military status. Alaska statutes allow for such a limited availability of resident licenses for military personnel who are stationed in Alaska but claim residency elsewhere. Determination of each service member’s status must be made on a case–by–case basis, but where the licensing and residency laws of other jurisdictions mirror Alaska’s, a service member may obtain a “resident” license in the other jurisdiction without forfeiting Alaska residency.

        Constitutionality of fee differential. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue of the constitutionality of the fee differential for resident and nonresident licenses does not implicate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. Carlson v. Commercial Fisheries Entry Comm'n, 919 P.2d 1337 (Alaska 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1101, 117 S. Ct. 789, 136 L. Ed. 2d 730 (U.S. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       The constitutionality of the fee differential for resident and nonresident licenses under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution turns on whether there is a sufficient relationship between the higher fees charged nonresidents and the state’s interest in imposing on nonresidents their share of the costs for managing the state’s commercial fisheries; the disparate fees charged to nonresidents are not unconstitutional if the differential does not exceed the contribution made by residents, because the differential will be justified as imposing on nonresidents their share of the costs of commercial fisheries. Carlson v. Commercial Fisheries Entry Comm'n, 919 P.2d 1337 (Alaska 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1101, 117 S. Ct. 789, 136 L. Ed. 2d 730 (U.S. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a lawsuit centering on whether Alaska could charge nonresidents more for commercial fishing licenses than it charged resident commercial fishers, the fee differential satisfies the three-part constitutional test: (1) the fee differential was compensating for a clearly defined intrastate burden; (2) the fee differential was limited such that it did not exceed the burden borne by state residents; and (3) the event being taxed, namely the license to use state fisheries, was the same for residents and nonresidents. State v. Carlson, 65 P.3d 851 (Alaska 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 963, 124 S. Ct. 387, 157 L. Ed. 2d 305 (U.S. 2003), rev'd in part, 270 P.3d 755 (Alaska 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a lawsuit centering on whether Alaska could charge nonresidents more for commercial fishing licenses than it charged resident commercial fishers, a refund for overpayment of taxes would only be necessary if the difference between the actual fees charged to resident and nonresident commercial fishers was substantially in excess of the allowable fee differential indicated by the formula, such that the actual fees did not bear a reasonable relationship to costs not otherwise paid by nonresidents. State v. Carlson, 65 P.3d 851 (Alaska 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 963, 124 S. Ct. 387, 157 L. Ed. 2d 305 (U.S. 2003), rev'd in part, 270 P.3d 755 (Alaska 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a lawsuit centering on whether Alaska could charge nonresidents more for commercial fishing licenses than it charged resident commercial fishers, although nonresident commercial fishers may be expected to reimburse the State for a share of the costs of fisheries management, inclusion of general governmental costs would expand the scope of the fisheries budget beyond the bounds of constitutionality. State v. Carlson, 65 P.3d 851 (Alaska 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 963, 124 S. Ct. 387, 157 L. Ed. 2d 305 (U.S. 2003), rev'd in part, 270 P.3d 755 (Alaska 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a lawsuit centering on whether Alaska could charge nonresidents more for commercial fishing licenses than it charged resident commercial fishers, although general capital expenditures were rejected by the trial court, capital expenditures directly related to the commercial fishing industry, such as for boat harbors and salmon hatcheries, or expenditures to the hatcheries loan fund, could be included in the fisheries budget to the extent that they were not already included in the direct operating expenditures; on remand, a determination of whether the costs were already included in the direct operating expenditures would be required as the State would not be allowed to count them twice. State v. Carlson, 65 P.3d 851 (Alaska 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 963, 124 S. Ct. 387, 157 L. Ed. 2d 305 (U.S. 2003), rev'd in part, 270 P.3d 755 (Alaska 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a lawsuit centering on whether Alaska could charge nonresidents more for commercial fishing licenses than it charged resident commercial fishers, the State had consciously chosen the manner in which it managed its fish, and had therefore decided to forgo any revenues that could be obtained from alternate forms of management; thus, the State could not recoup from nonresidents the possible revenue it had forgone in making policy decisions regarding its fisheries management, and the trial judge properly excluded forgone revenues from the cost of commercial fisheries management. State v. Carlson, 65 P.3d 851 (Alaska 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 963, 124 S. Ct. 387, 157 L. Ed. 2d 305 (U.S. 2003), rev'd in part, 270 P.3d 755 (Alaska 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a lawsuit centering on whether Alaska could charge nonresidents more for commercial fishing licenses than it charged resident commercial fishers, although the class argued that the trial court erred by including interest income deposited into state savings accounts as a part of oil revenue, the State’s methodology provided a reasonable means for calculating the percentage of the state budget derived from oil revenues; thus, the State’s methodology for calculating the costs associated with the fisheries was affirmed. State v. Carlson, 65 P.3d 851 (Alaska 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 963, 124 S. Ct. 387, 157 L. Ed. 2d 305 (U.S. 2003), rev'd in part, 270 P.3d 755 (Alaska 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a lawsuit centering on whether Alaska could charge nonresidents more for commercial fishing licenses than it charged resident commercial fishers, because the State’s expert witness testified that the disputed direct and indirect costs were directly related to the costs of fisheries management, the superior court’s findings with regard to the methodology for determining direct and indirect operating expenditures and the corresponding calculations were appropriate. State v. Carlson, 65 P.3d 851 (Alaska 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 963, 124 S. Ct. 387, 157 L. Ed. 2d 305 (U.S. 2003), rev'd in part, 270 P.3d 755 (Alaska 2012).

       Penalties for strict liability commercial fishing violations under subsection (a), including a maximum fine of $3,000 for a first offender, or $6,000 for a repeat offender, do not connote criminality in the context of the highly-regulated multimillion-dollar fishing industry, nor is the fact that the amount of forfeiture for such violation may be substantial suggestive of criminality.

      <p>
       Entities charged with strict liability commercial fishing violations under subsection (a) are not entitled to a trial by jury; such violations are minor offenses which do not fall within established standards for determining whether a criminal jury trial is required, and, being criminal rather than civil in nature, a civil jury trial is not required.

       Vacating of defendants’ conviction for taking salmon in closed waters was appropriate when defendants claimed that defendants’ fishing vessel drifted into the closed waters while defendants attempted to repair a leak in the hydraulic system of their fishing vessel because the trial court erred in concluding that the potential damage to defendant’s vessel and equipment and the destruction of the salmon catch onboard defendants’ vessel resulting from the hydraulic spill did not constitute a significant evil for purposes of the necessity defense.

      <p>
       This section states that fishermen may be sanctioned in two ways for their conduct — fine and forfeiture. The statute allows the state to seize the illegal catch itself, or, if it has already been sold, the statute allows the state to seize the proceeds or fair market value of the sale. McCann v.

      <p>
       The clear intent of the forfeiture language in this section is to prevent the violator from profiting in any way from the illegal catch. Nothing in the statute allows for a forfeiture in order to “make the state whole”. McCann v. State, 817 P.2d 484 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).

      <p>
       Given the nature and consequences of defendant's conduct, the trial court acted reasonably within its discretion to order forfeiture of defendant's interests in a fishing vessel, seine skiff, and the net he used while committing misdemeanor commercial fishing offenses; defendant's conduct caused significant biological impact and showed a blatant disregard for the resource. Demmert v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 25, 2021) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Forfeiture did not violate the excessive fines clause of the Eighth Amendment or plainly violate the right to rehabilitation in the Alaska Constitution because defendant failed to make a record as to the value of his interests in a skiff, and the net he used while committing misdemeanor commercial fishing offenses; the court of appeals, therefore, had no meaningful way of assessing the value of the forfeiture of interests in the skiff and net. Demmert v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 25, 2021) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Forfeiture did not violate the excessive fines clause of the Eighth Amendment or plainly violate the right to rehabilitation in the Alaska Constitution because although defendant could no longer have ownership of a fishing vessel, skiff, and the net he used while committing misdemeanor commercial fishing offense, nothing in the trial court's sentence appeared to preclude him from engaging in his livelihood of commercial fishing on another boat.

       Subsection (a) of this section provides for the mandatory forfeiture only of fish taken or retained as a result of the violation for which the defendant has been convicted. When the statute is so construed, the defendant must still overcome the presumption that all fish on board his vessel were taken as the result of the violation for which he was convicted.

       Unlike the forfeiture authorized by subsection (a) of this section, the fine provided for in subsection (b) of the statute does not depend on the amount of fish taken as a result of the violation.

      On July 1, 1980, the attorney general advised the governor that the house and senate did not pass the same bill (SCS HB 207 am S (H. failed eff. date)), and the governor, acting on that advice, returned the bill to the house unsigned. For governor’s transmittal letter, see 1980 House Journal, p. 2240, and 1980 Senate Journal, p. 1781. Legislative counsel advised that under art. II, §§ 17 and 18, Constitution of Alaska, the bill became law without the governor’s signature, with an effective date of October 5, 1980. By judgment dated March 19, 1981, in Alaska Legislative Council v. Hammond, case no. 4FA-80-1689, the superior court for the fourth judicial district upheld the validity of the enactment of ch. 177, SLA 1980.

       Although this section is not clearly written, the likely intent of the legislature was that subsection (a) defines permitted purposes for which salmon may be taken and also requires that the carcasses of salmon taken for permitted purposes be utilized.

       The most literal interpretation of subsection (b) of this section is that it is a grant of authority to the commissioner of fish and game to add other uses to those listed in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a). O'Callaghan v. Rue, 996 P.2d 88 (Alaska 2000).

        Sufficiency of the evidence. —

      <p>
       Evidence supported defendant's conviction for fishing with an over-length commercial salmon seine vessel because the testimony of state troopers who measured defendant's vessel was sufficient to establish that the overall length of the vessel exceeded 58 feet and that defendant knew or should have known that the vessel was longer than 58 feet. Moreover, the jury reasonably could have concluded that an assembly that was attached to the vessel should have been included in the overall length measurement as it was not an anchor roller.

       The definition of the term “anchor roller” in the Alaska Administrative Code was inconsistent with the intent of the statutory provisions that excluded the anchor roller from the overall measurement of a vessel. Furthermore, the regulation was reasonably necessary to implement the statute; was neither arbitrary, nor irrational, and was not so vague that it deprived a person of due process.

        Procedure for gaining permission to ford controlled river or stream. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A person seeking to ford a controlled river or stream must first give notice to the commissioner and include in his notice sufficient “plans and specifications” so that the commissioner will know what he intends to do, when he intends to do it, what risk he foresees to fish in the vicinity, and what steps he intends to undertake for their protection.
       The commissioner will then review the notification and either grant the request, reject the application, or request “full” plans and specifications requiring the actor to go into greater detail and answer specific questions.

       Defendant’s motion to suppress was properly denied because there was an objectively reasonable basis for the stop where a trooper, while not citing the correct statute, knew that defendant was violating the law by driving on the bed of a river, a special use permit issued by the Commissioner of the Department of Fish and Game to the public at large did not permit the activity to which defendant engaged, and the statute was broad enough to encompass noncommercial activities.

      A domestic or nondomestic animal becomes feral when it returns to a wild state. In the case of a partially domesticated or captive wild animal such as a fox that escapes, this generally means when the animal is no longer under the control of its owner or the owner is not in direct pursuit. In the case of a domestic animal such as a cow or pig that escapes, it is “feral” when it is living as a wild creature, and this may take more or less time depending on the circumstances. In the case of a domestic animal trespassing upon public lands, it could be declared “feral” under statute or regulation.

Moreover, the jury reasonably could have concluded that an assembly that was attached to the vessel should have been included in the overall length measurement as it was not an anchor roller.

      Definition of “subsistence uses” in terms of “customary and traditional uses of wild, renewable resources” reflects the equating of “subsistence use” with use by rural residents. 1981 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 11.

      A domestic or nondomestic animal becomes feral when it returns to a wild state. In the case of a partially domesticated or captive wild animal such as a fox that escapes, this generally means when the animal is no longer under the control of its owner or the owner is not in direct pursuit. In the case of a domestic animal such as a cow or pig that escapes, it is “feral” when it is living as a wild creature, and this may take more or less time depending on the circumstances. In the case of a domestic animal trespassing upon public lands, it could be declared “feral” under statute or regulation.
      July 30, 1987 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The statutory term “feral domestic animal” found in the definition of “game” is a contradiction in terms; any regulatory clarification should focus on what is a “feral animal” and explain that the term “feral domestic animal” is interpreted to mean a domestic or domesticated animal that has become feral. July 30, 1987 Op. Att’y Gen.

      If factual information supported the proposition that it is “customary and traditional” to make handicraft articles from sea otter skins, and if sea otters are or have been taken customarily and traditionally for direct personal or family consumption as food, shelter, fuel, clothing, tools, or transportation, then skins of sea otters could be used for making handicrafts, even if the meat were not eaten.
      If sea otters were not customarily and traditionally taken for food, shelter, fuel, clothing, tools, or transportation, it would arguably not be permissible to harvest the animals only for handicraft purposes under subsistence regulations. Mar. 14, 1988 Op. Att’y Gen.

      A member of the military who claims Alaska residency, and who is transferred to another state, may be allowed to obtain a “resident” rather than a “nonresident” hunting or fishing license in that state, based upon the service member’s military status. Alaska statutes allow for such a limited availability of resident licenses for military personnel who are stationed in Alaska but claim residency elsewhere. Determination of each service member’s status must be made on a case–by–case basis, but where the licensing and residency laws of other jurisdictions mirror Alaska’s, a service member may obtain a “resident” license in the other jurisdiction without forfeiting Alaska residency.
      2003 Op. Att'y Gen. 14.

       Although the Alaska Board of Fisheries has the statutory authority to allocate fishery resources among personal use, sport, guided sport, and commercial fisheries, the Board is not precluded from making intragroup allocations within those general categories. Therefore, in an initiative dispute, it was error to conclude that the relevant user group was “commercial fishers” as a whole instead of the subset of commercial fishers who use set nets.

       is not intended to grant subsistence rights to any long-term users of an area, and it was proper to consider the cultural, social, and economic context in which a harvest takes place; even if personal use fisheries met the subsistence statute’s consistency and duration requirements, they might not have carried the cultural, social, spiritual, and nutritional importance that the subsistence statute protects.

       Since manageability is the key element in the classification of a category of fish as a “stock,” it was not unreasonable for the fisheries board to group salmon stocks together where it determined that subsistence users themselves “customarily and traditionally” took the species interchangeably.

       Legislative policy on utilization of herring.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature finds the following: (1) extensive and valuable herring populations are available for harvest in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the state; (2) commercial markets are available for herring processed in several forms; (3) one processing technique presently employed involves deliberately permitting decomposition of the herring carcass to allow for removal and subsequent sale of the roe product, with the consequence that the flesh is unusable and discarded.
      The legislature declares that the process referred to in (3) of this section is wasteful and does not constitute utilization of this resource for the maximum benefit of the people. Therefore, it is the policy of the legislature that this process should be eliminated to the fullest extent possible.

        A state may reasonably extend its jurisdiction to control fish and game resources outside the limited area of its territorial sovereignty,
       </b>
       if such an exercise is based on the conservation principles inherent in migratory characteristics and not based on artificial boundaries or political circumstances.
       State v. Bundrant, 546 P.2d 530 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska’s interest in regulating extraterritorial fishing qualifies as one recognized for a legitimate exercise of police power.
       There is an established fishery with clear economic impact in the Bering Sea fishery area.
       The migratory habits of the crab are predictable and fishing outside the three-mile limit depends on growth and development within the limit.
       If the fishery outside the three-mile limit destroys the resource outside, it will similarly destroy the resource inside the three-mile limit.

       Paragraphs (4) and (5) of this section make it clear that the purpose of the application of fisheries laws to the high seas is to conserve shellfish found “inside the waters of the state.” State v. Bundrant, 546 P.2d 530 (Alaska 1976).

      In 1997, to reconcile §§ 2 and 10, ch. 62, SLA 1994 with § 2, ch. 73, SLA 1994 the provisions of (a)(1)(C) and the references to a quota share loan in (a)(8) added by ch. 73, SLA 1994 were retained despite the delayed reenactment of subsection (a) by § 2, ch. 62, SLA 1994. For the same reason, “to” was inserted at the beginning of (a)(1)(A) and (B).

      Five-year residency requirements provided for in subparagraphs (a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(B), and (a)(1)(C) (now repealed) of this section were unconstitutional, since the state’s interest in ensuring that only bona fide resident commercial fishermen qualify for the commercial fishing loan program did not outweigh the infringement on the right of less-than-five-year residents to share in the economic benefits of the program.

      Since the conditions for issuance of a hatchery permit do not appear to be inconsistent with the operation of a fish processing and marketing facility in conjunction with the hatchery, a nonprofit hatchery can also process and market fisheries’ products, but any profit would have to be used for expansion or improvement of facilities, hatcheries research or other authorized purposes of the regional association within which the corporation is located.

        <li id="t16c10a12s16.10.750ol1a1">
         the salmon fishing industry is among the state’s largest industries and generates hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of jobs each year; the salmon fishery is vitally important to commercial, subsistence, personal use, and sport fishing interests, and to the state’s developing tourist industry;
        </li>
        <li id="t16c10a12s16.10.750ol1a2">
         the state is committed to maintaining and enhancing its wild stocks of salmon by careful management, by initiating a 20-year rebuilding program, and by investing in the fishing industry;
        </li>
        <li id="t16c10a12s16.10.750ol1a3">
         millions of Alaska salmon are being caught and injured by high seas fisheries that intercept salmon contrary to state, federal, or international law; the high seas interception of Alaska salmon defeats the state’s management and rebuilding programs, deprives the state of a return on its investment in the fishing industry, and detrimentally affects subsistence and sport fishing uses of Alaska salmon;
        </li>
        <li id="t16c10a12s16.10.750ol1a4">
         vessels that engage in the high seas interception of salmon can move relatively freely and undetected from region to region in the North Pacific and thus are able to harvest whatever species is most readily available or most valuable; by moving farther westward, a greater proportion of the take is Asian salmon; moving eastward results in a greater proportion of the take being Alaska salmon; although there is intermixing of Asian and North American salmon stocks, scientific evidence proves that even a minimal harvest of salmon within the migratory range of each species will contain Alaska salmon;
        </li>
        <li id="t16c10a12s16.10.750ol1a5">
         the illegal taking of salmon detrimentally affects the Alaska fishing industry; the illegal taking of Alaska salmon is of primary concern because of the direct and immediate effect on the state; in addition, the illegal taking of Asian salmon is also of concern because depletion of those stocks will ultimately result in a shifting of high seas fishing efforts, both legal and illegal, to Alaska salmon;
        </li>
        <li id="t16c10a12s16.10.750ol1a6">
         high seas interception of salmon occurs beyond the exclusive economic zone of the United States, or through incursion within the exclusive economic zone and the state’s territorial sea, by vessels that are usually not registered in this state; moreover, these vessels are not based in Alaska and can thus avoid detection more easily than Alaska-based vessels; as a practical matter, it is extremely difficult to directly or indirectly regulate the vessels themselves; it is therefore necessary to prohibit activities within the state that give aid, comfort, and financial incentives to high seas interception of salmon.

      The most logical interpretation of statutory provisions gives the Alaska Department of Fish and Game permit authority in special areas over any activity which the department determines may affect fish or game or their habitat; that interpretation is consistent with the language of the statutes and the general rule articulated by the Alaska Supreme Court, in
      <i>
       Kenai Peninsula Fisherman’s Coop. Ass’n v. State
      </i>
      , Sup. Ct. Op. No. 2358 (File No. 5072), 628 P.2d 897 (1981), that “conservation laws such as fish and game laws should be liberally construed to achieve their intended purpose.”

       There are due process problems inherent in the application of this section where game has been illegally taken.
       After a big game animal has been illegally killed a hunter should not have to incriminate himself, nor subject himself to liability for further criminal acts. Gudmundson v. State, 822 P.2d 1328 (Alaska 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendants’ due process rights were violated because they were placed in a “cruel dilemma” at the scene of the shooting since they would have committed a crime whether they acted or failed to act. On the day of the kill, they had two choices, both illegal, available to them: They could salvage the sheep and become criminally liable for illegal transportation of game (5 AAC 92.140) or they could decline to salvage and become liable for wanton waste under subsection (a). Gudmundson v. State, 822 P.2d 1328 (Alaska 1991).

       The determination that the mandatory minimum sentence should be divided between codefendants is unsupported by legal authority, and the double jeopardy clauses of the United States and Alaska Constitutions do not preclude vacating the sentences and ordering the sentencing judge to impose the full mandatory minimum sentence and fine on both defendants. Knutson v. State, 736 P.2d 775 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).

      </p>
      <p>
       By requiring stock to be intended for use for further growth or propagation, the statutory definition of “stock” demands something more than passive growth; its express terms command an intent to “use” the wild stock “for” further growth, and these purposive words unmistakably signal an intended use that will produce growth through action; a mere waiting period between issuance of a permit and commercial harvest would not meet this definition.

        Purposes. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the legislature’s statement of purpose in this section, the following broad purposes can be discerned: 1) enhancing the economic benefit to fishermen since too many involved in the industry prevented those relying on fishing for a livelihood from securing adequate remuneration; 2) conserving the fishery; and 3) avoiding unjust discrimination in the allocation of a limited number of entry permits. Commercial Fisheries Entry Comm'n v. Apokedak, 606 P.2d 1255 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       This chapter’s purposes are not merely economic; it was designed to protect the reliance interests of all individuals using the fishery, as well as aiding the dependent fishermen. Rutter v. State, 668 P.2d 1343 (Alaska 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Limited Entry Act has two purposes:
       enabling fishermen to receive adequate remuneration and conserving the fishery. Johns v. Commercial Fisheries Entry Comm'n, 758 P.2d 1256 (Alaska 1988).

       The requirement that applicants for entry permits be past gear licensees bears a fair and substantial relationship to the purpose of preventing unjust discrimination in allocating entry permits. Commercial Fisheries Entry Comm'n v. Apokedak, 680 P.2d 486 (Alaska 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Setting the maximum number of permits at 73 was reasonable and in accord with the letter and spirit of the Limited Entry Act; because the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission considered past participation and other related factors, its decision regarding the maximum was not arbitrary. Simpson v. State, 101 P.3d 605 (Alaska 2004).

       Denial of applications for limited entry permits in the sablefish fishery for insufficient points was proper because substantial evidence supported the conclusion by the Alaska Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission that appellants were not misinformed, and the commission had a reasonable basis for its conclusion that appellants’ mechanical troubles did not constitute extraordinary circumstances.

      <p>
       The Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission committed an error of law in its interpretation of the unavoidable circumstances regulation, 20 AAC 05.630(a)(5), and the special circumstances regulation, 20 AAC 05.630(b)(2), in awarding points for a limited entry permit; there is nothing in the language of either regulation to suggest a one-year limitation on unavoidable or special circumstances.

       Fisherman’s claim that, because he obtained his gear license in 1974, his income dependence was not realistically reflected by his income dependence percentage for the years 1971 and 1972, entitling him to “special circumstances” points, was unpersuasive; although he worked on his father’s boat in the years preceding 1974, he did so as a crew member, not a co-owner. He began fishing as a crew member long before the passage of the Limited Entry Act, but did not acquire a gear license until 1974. Brandal v. State, 128 P.3d 732 (Alaska 2006).

      <p>
       Where the failure of the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission to consider a non-English speaking Alaska native’s dependence on others had the potential to result in unjust discrimination, the case was remanded to the commission for explicit determination as to whether the factual circumstances relating to the native’s application for crewing points warranted granting an exception in her case to the commission’s licensure requirement.

        Allocating one permit between two partners

       solely on the fortuitous circumstances of which one held the gear license in two given years did not realistically weigh the relative hardship which each partner would suffer by denial of a permit, and the commission was required to issue the permit to both partners in order to avoid “unjust discrimination.” Commercial Fisheries Entry Comm'n v. Templeton, 598 P.2d 77 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       While a gear license may be a good general indicator of ownership and operation of gear for the purpose of weighing relative hardship, to foreclose automatically consideration of special circumstances under a regulation establishing means of measuring economic dependence in the absence of a gear license would result, in many cases, in unjust discrimination.

      A limited entry fishing permit does not have the status of a property right such that otherwise constitutional legislative changes to the nature of a limited entry permit would require the payment of compensation.

      </p>
      <p>
       The equal protection clause of art. I, § 1 of the state constitution is not violated by the permit transfer provisions of the Limited Entry Act. State v. Ostrosky, 667 P.2d 1184 (Alaska 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Free transferability of entry permits violates neither art. VIII, § 3 nor art. VIII, § 15 of the state constitution.State v. Ostrosky, 667 P.2d 1184 (Alaska 1983).

       <b>
        Purpose of subsection (g). —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (g) of this section resulted from a legislative aim to avoid subjecting fishermen to “economic coercion” as a result of holding a valuable license to participate in the fishery; its effect is to allow fishermen to take advantage of the value of their permits if they no longer wish to participate in the fishery, but to prevent the forced loss of livelihood that would result from court-ordered sales of permits. Brown v. Baker, 688 P.2d 943 (Alaska 1984).

        Security interest in entry permit illegal. —

       Encumbrance or reservation of a security interest in a limited entry fishing permit is illegal under subsection (g) of this section. Brown v. Baker, 688 P.2d 943 (Alaska 1984).

       <b>
        Illegal contract unenforceable. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The parties’ oral agreement to retransfer a fishing permit directly contravened paragraph (g)(2) of this section. Thus, the promise was unenforceable. Pavone v. Pavone, 860 P.2d 1228 (Alaska 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a transfer agreement is found to contain an illegal term, the agreement either wholly or in part should not be enforced. Diksen v. Troxell, 938 P.2d 1009 (Alaska 1997).

       Expressions of legislative intent in combination with the clear provisions of the 1982 Exemptions Act are persuasive that the legislature meant to permit a parent with past due child support claims to execute against an otherwise exempt limited entry permit.

      </p>
      <p>
       A deceased permit holder’s “contrary intention” under subsection (h) of this section is to be discovered through the application of Title 13 will provisions, including will construction statutes. Wik v. Wik, 681 P.2d 336 (Alaska 1984).

      <p>
       “Lien” against limited entry permit, to the extent allowed by law, was effectively an order against the husband’s person requiring him to turn over sales proceeds in the event he sold his permit, to use the money to satisfy his property division debts, and did not improperly encumber the permit. Brandal v. Shangin, 36 P.3d 1188 (Alaska 2001).

        Fishing entry permit not compensable property. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the plain language of subsection (e), fishing entry permit is not compensable property for purposes of takings clauses in the Fifth Amendment, Alaska Const., art. I, § 18, and Alaska Const., art VIII, § 16; therefore, commercial salmon fishers failed to state a takings claim based on regulations that reduced the amount of fish they were able to catch, which reduced the value of their entry permits. Vanek v. State, 193 P.3d 283 (Alaska 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Regulatory changes to permit holders’ entry permits for commercial salmon fishing did not require payment of just compensation under the Fifth Amendment takings clause; an entry permit is a use privilege, not “property” for purposes of a takings claim. Vandevere v. Lloyd, 644 F.3d 957 (9th Cir. Alaska), cert. denied, 565 U.S. 1093, 132 S. Ct. 850, 181 L. Ed. 2d 550 (U.S. 2011).

        Constitutionality of fee differential. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue of the constitutionality of the fee differential for resident and nonresident permits does not implicate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. Carlson v. Commercial Fisheries Entry Comm'n, 919 P.2d 1337 (Alaska 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1101, 117 S. Ct. 789, 136 L. Ed. 2d 730 (U.S. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue of the constitutionality of the fee differential for resident and nonresident permits under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution turns on whether there is a sufficient relationship between the higher fees charged nonresidents and the state’s interest in imposing on nonresidents their share of the costs for managing the state’s commercial fisheries; the disparate fees charged to nonresidents are not unconstitutional if the differential does not exceed the contribution made by residents, because the differential will be justified as imposing on nonresidents their share of the costs of commercial fisheries.
       Carlson v. Commercial Fisheries Entry Comm'n, 919 P.2d 1337 (Alaska 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1101, 117 S. Ct. 789, 136 L. Ed. 2d 730 (U.S. 1997).

      <p>
       Commercial fishing is a sufficiently important activity to come within the purview of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and license fees which discriminate against nonresidents are prima facie a violation of it. Carlson v. State, 798 P.2d 1269 (Alaska 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       State’s 3:1 fee differential for nonresident commercial fishing permits violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1, because it is not rationally related to the state’s goal of equalizing the burden of fisheries management between nonresidents and residents; a fee scheme substantially related to the state’s goal would guarantee substantial, rather than precise, equality. State v. Carlson, 191 P.3d 137 (Alaska 2008), overruled in part, Burton v. Fountainhead Dev., Inc., 393 P.3d 387 (Alaska 2017).

       The state may equalize the economic burden of fisheries management; where residents pay proportionately more by way of foregone benefits than nonresidents for fisheries management, nonresidents may be charged higher fees to make up the difference. Carlson v. State, 798 P.2d 1269 (Alaska 1990).

      </p>
      <p>
       Limited Entry Act fees were intended to substitute for the previous differential gear license fees as the means of ensuring nonresident contribution toward the cost; therefore, the 3:1 differential in fees was a proper implementation of the purposes of the Act. Carlson v. State, 798 P.2d 1269 (Alaska 1990).

        Regulatory point scheme held constitutional. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The point scheme under regulations promulgated by the commission to regulate entry into the commercial fisheries based on a “hardship” standard of economic dependence is reasonable and not arbitrary, as it provides for consideration of all the factors which the legislature thought relevant to economic dependence, and bears a fair and substantial relation to the object of the act: an applicant with a higher income dependence percentage has a greater degree of dependence on the fishery for income, and would therefore tend to suffer greater hardship by exclusion than would an applicant with a lower income dependence percentage who has a greater reliance on alternative occupations and is less dependent on the fishery.
       If income from alternative occupations is invested into the fishery, the applicant receives recognition of that investment by being awarded points for ownership of vessels and gear.
       It cannot reasonably be argued that the percentage of income derived from the fishery is substantially unrelated to the hardship an applicant would suffer by exclusion from the fishery. The regulations are not facially unconstitutional. Younker v. Alaska Commercial Fisheries Entry Comm'n, 598 P.2d 917 (Alaska 1979).

      <p>
       Within the scheme of the point system used for issuing limited entry permits, the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission’s administrative regulation specifying the number of points awarded for availability of alternative occupations based solely on the total population and the proportion of rural population in the census district or county of an applicant’s domicile (20 AAC 05.630(b)(4)) violates equal protection rights guaranteed by Alaska Const., art. I, § 1. Deubelbeiss v. Commercial Fisheries Entry Comm'n, 689 P.2d 487 (Alaska 1984).

      <p>
       Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission regulation requiring that setnetters applying for permits to enter the gill net fishery be 90 percent dependent upon income from fishing in 1972 to receive full income dependence points was not arbitrary and unreasonable, and did not deny equal protection.

The commission may define fishing capacity in terms of quantity of fishing gear, a proportion of the maximum amount of gear that can be utilized in the fishery under regulations of the Board of Fisheries, fishing vessel size or other characteristics, or other factors determined by the commission to affect the amount of fishing effort in the fishery. The recipient or transferee of an entry permit issued subject to this subsection may not exceed the fishing capacity allowed under the entry permit.

        Commission authority to revoke licenses. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       While the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission has the inherent authority to revoke a license it has granted because of fraud in the application, it does not have the authority to revoke licenses merely because it granted them improvidently. Kjarstad v. State, 703 P.2d 1167 (Alaska 1985).

        Knowing submission of false information. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though substantial evidence supports the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission’s conclusion that a fisherman was not domiciled in Alaska, revocation of his permit does not automatically follow; the language of this section requires that the fisherman knowingly have submitted false information. Kjarstad v. State, 703 P.2d 1167 (Alaska 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Merely making a claim for points to which one is unentitled
       </b>
       does not constitute providing false information under this section; the permit application form itself encourages applicants to claim points to which they may not be entitled by instructing applicants to claim all additional points for which they have evidence. Kjarstad v. State, 703 P.2d 1167 (Alaska 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the information that a fisherman supplied to the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission was certainly not complete, but neither was it false, the commission had the opportunity to return the obviously incomplete application for completion or to simply deny the fisherman the permit.
       The fact that the fisherman’s permit was granted as a result of “administrative error” does not demonstrate that he violated the terms of this section by claiming one point for availability of alternative occupations, for the instructions advised applicants to claim all the additional points for which they could submit evidence. Kjarstad v. State, 703 P.2d 1167 (Alaska 1985).

       Question of whether the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission has committed obvious error in using a vessel count to calculate the maximum “unit of gear,” as defined in (11), clearly falls within the agency’s expertise. Therefore, a fisher was required to exhaust administrative remedies before challenging the method of calculation in the court. Doubleday v. State, 238 P.3d 100 (Alaska 2010).

      <p>
       The duty of the said commission is to make inquiry and ascertain from time to time the methods, practices, circumstances, and conditions which are disclosed for bringing about the conservation and the prevention of the depletion and physical waste of the fisheries, marine, shell, and anadromous, in all of those areas of the Pacific Ocean and adjacent waters over which the compacting states jointly or separately have or acquire jurisdiction.
       The commission may recommend the coordination of the exercise of the police powers of the several states within their respective jurisdictions and the conservation zones to promote the preservation of those fisheries and their protection against overfishing, waste, depletion, or any abuse whatsoever and to assure a continuing yield from the fisheries resources of the signatory parties to this compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       To that end the commission shall draft and, after consultation with the advisory committee authorized by art. VII of this compact, recommend to the governors and legislative branches of the signatory states to this compact legislation dealing with the conservation of the marine, shell, and anadromous fisheries in all of those areas of the Pacific Ocean over which the compacting states jointly or separately have or acquire jurisdiction.
       The commission shall, more than one month before a regular meeting of the legislative branch in a signatory state, present to the governor of the state its recommendations relating to enactments by the legislative branch of that state in furthering the purposes of this compact.
      </p>
