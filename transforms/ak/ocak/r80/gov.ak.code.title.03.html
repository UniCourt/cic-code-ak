        Constitutionality of livestock inspection law. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The livestock inspection law (SLA 1919, ch. 55), prohibiting the sale of diseased cattle, is not unconstitutional because its title states the purpose of the act to be to prohibit the importation into Alaska of diseased livestock and to make provision for the eradication of diseased livestock now in Alaska. The act itself has a single subject, the protection of the people of Alaska from diseased livestock.
       Its title discloses this in its proposed protection against disease by importation of cattle and disease in the cattle in the state. The penalizing of the sale of diseased livestock is germane to such protection, since sale is an incident of a likely transportation of the diseased livestock, with the contagious saliva droppings on the highway or land traversed, and its communication to other stock of the vendee. Martin v. Sheely, 144 F.2d 754, 10 Alaska 437 (9th Cir. Alaska 1944).
