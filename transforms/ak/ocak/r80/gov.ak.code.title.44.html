        Canadian territorial waters. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute setting jurisdiction of the state in offshore waters did not extend the state criminal jurisdiction into Canadian territorial waters; therefore, charges against defendant for sexual misconduct aboard a state ferry traveling in Canadian territorial waters had to be dismissed. State v. Jack, 67 P.3d 673 (Alaska Ct. App. 2003), rev'd, 125 P.3d 311 (Alaska 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States’ authority over its flagged vessels while they are in foreign territorial waters is not exclusive. The coastal state has a concurrent interest in regulating the conduct aboard vessels within its territorial waters. In other words, the fact that the United States has criminal jurisdiction over its flagged vessels does not preclude Canada from exercising its own jurisdiction when conduct aboard the vessel affects Canada’s peace, dignity or tranquility. And even if the United States has jurisdiction over a vessel while it is in Canada’s territorial waters, it does not follow that Alaska has the same jurisdiction, because nothing in this section indicates that the legislature intended to assert jurisdiction over an Alaskan vessel operating outside the territorial waters specifically described in the statute. State v. Jack, 67 P.3d 673 (Alaska Ct. App. 2003), rev'd, 125 P.3d 311 (Alaska 2005).

        Jurisdiction over alleged crime on state ferry in Canadian waters. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska had jurisdiction under this section to prosecute defendant for a sexual assault that allegedly occurred on an Alaska state ferry in Canadian waters because the alleged crime occurred in “water offshore from the coast” of Alaska within the meaning of that phrase as used in this section, and Alaska has jurisdiction over crimes committed on state ferries operating in Canadian waters; two independent alternative grounds support jurisdiction: Paragraph (2) of this section, and the effects doctrine.

      When land shifts occur by earthquake-generated avulsion, the element of suddenness creates a situation where no change occurs in the limits of state boundaries or private tracts; the old state and private boundaries, submerged or otherwise, survive. 1964 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 6.

       Because the effects doctrine is widely recognized by case law and legal commentators, it is a “reason recognized by law” within the meaning of paragraph (1) of this section; no other or more specific statute is needed to justify the exercise of state extraterritorial jurisdiction: What is required is that the state must have a substantial interest so that the exercise of jurisdiction under the effects doctrine is reasonable.

     Section 1, ch. 143, SLA 1978 added a new chapter, designated AS 44.63 and renumbered in 1978 as AS 44.07. Chapter 143, however, had a conditional effective date and that condition has never been met. Section 7, ch. 143, SLA 1978 provided that the Act would take “effect 30 days after certification that a bond issue for costs of relocation of the capital has been adopted by the voters of the state.” In November 1978, the voters rejected a bond issue for costs of relocation of the capital. Chapter 54, SLA 1981, placed a ballot question before the voters related to the relocation of the capital. At the November 1982 general election that ballot measure failed, and by the conditions of ch. 54, SLA 1981 all other provisions related to capital relocation were repealed. The failure to include the repeal of ch. 143, SLA 1978 may have been intentional, because the law had not gone into effect and, therefore, did not need to be repealed. All other provisions of the Alaska Statutes that would have been affected by ch. 143, SLA 1978 have subsequently been repealed or amended by the legislature. For the text of the law enacted by ch. 143, SLA 1978, see either the 1980 or 1984 pamphlets for this title, or the 1978 Session Laws of Alaska.

      <p>
       Since a statute forbidding the use of the official state seal “for any advertising or commercial purpose” does not impact any non-commercial use of the seal, and since the state has a legitimate governmental interest in regulating the commercial use of that seal, there was no constitutional bar to the prosecution of the defendant for marketing commemorative coins bearing the seal.

       Federal copyright law did not preempt this section, as it was clear that states had the power to protect symbols of their sovereignty, state seals appeared to be more akin to trademarks or service marks than they were to the type of work Congress intended copyrights to cover, and it seemed evident that Congress, by protecting specific important federal seals that were left unprotected by copyright law and by federal trademark law, did not intend to prohibit states from protecting seals that represented state sovereignty. Robart v. State, 82 P.3d 787 (Alaska Ct. App.), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 940, 125 S. Ct. 310, 160 L. Ed. 2d 249 (U.S. 2004).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The design of the official flag is eight gold stars in a field of blue, so selected for its simplicity, its originality, and its symbolism. The blue, one of the national colors, typifies the evening sky, the blue of the sea and of mountain lakes, and of wild flowers that grow in Alaskan soil, the gold being significant of the wealth that lies hidden in Alaska’s hills and streams.
     </p>
     <p>
      The stars, seven of which form the constellation Ursa Major, the Great Bear, the most conspicuous constellation in the northern sky, contains the stars which form the “Dipper,” including the “Pointers” which point toward the eighth star in the flag, Polaris, the North Star, the ever constant star for the mariner, the explorer, hunter, trapper, prospector, woodsman, and the surveyor. For Alaska the northernmost star in the galaxy of stars represents Alaska, the forty-ninth star in the national emblem.
     </p>
     <p>
      The flag of the Territory of Alaska is the official flag of the state. The standard proportions and size graphically delineated herein shall be used in the manufacture of the official flag of Alaska. The stars shall be the color of natural yellow gold and the field of blue shall be of the same shade of blue used in the official manufacture of the national emblem of the United States. The design, standard proportions, and size are as follows:

       The University of Alaska is an instrumentality of the sovereign which enjoys in some limited respects a status which is co-equal rather than subordinate to that of the executive or the legislative arms of government.
       Therefore, it is not necessarily subject to such allocation under this section. University of Alaska v. National Aircraft Leasing, 536 P.2d 121 (Alaska 1975).

       is an agency of the state within the meanings of Civ. R. 4(d)(7) and (8), which require that a summons and complaint be served upon the attorney general or his designee, and within the meaning of Civ. R. 12(a), which allows a state agency 40 days after service within which to answer a complaint. Thus, the trial court erred in entering default judgment against the State-Operated School System, in effect holding that plaintiffs’ action was not against the state or an agency of the state.

     <p>
      The commission is created to encourage and supervise the development of an integrated public broadcasting system for the state and for the coordination of all public broadcasting stations.
      The primary purpose of the commission is the encouragement and support of noncommercial public broadcasting in the state through the provision of operating and capital grants in support of the delivery of noncommercial programs intended for a general audience by locally controlled nonprofit broadcast stations or telecommunications entities. The commission may support stations and entities that also engage in the delivery of instructional, for-credit programs, and the commission may provide funds for those purposes, but the primary purpose of commission funds is the support of activities that result in the delivery of general audience, noncommercial material.

       This section indicates that the office of the attorney general is to function with those powers and duties normally ascribed to it at common law. Public Defender Agency v. Superior Court, Third Judicial Dist., 534 P.2d 947 (Alaska 1975).

        Under the common law, an attorney general is empowered to bring any action which he thinks necessary

       to protect the public interest, and he possesses the corollary power to make any disposition of the state’s litigation which he thinks best. Public Defender Agency v. Superior Court, Third Judicial Dist., 534 P.2d 947 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where four federally recognized Native American tribes and a member of a fifth tribe sued the U.S. Department of the Interior and the Secretary of the Interior, challenging the validity of a regulatory bar prohibiting the Secretary from acquiring land located in Alaska into trust status, the Attorney General of the State of Alaska, under this section, had the authority to bring suit in court and waive Eleventh Amendment immunity to the extent necessary for the litigation.

       Discretionary control over the legal business of the state, both civil and criminal, includes the initiation, prosecution, and disposition of cases. Public Defender Agency v. Superior Court, Third Judicial Dist., 534 P.2d 947 (Alaska 1975).

        Discretion not subject to judicial review. —

      </p>
      <p>
       When an act is committed to executive discretion, the exercise of that discretion within constitutional bounds is not subject to the control or review of the courts.
       To interfere with that discretion would be a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers. Public Defender Agency v. Superior Court, Third Judicial Dist., 534 P.2d 947 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the supreme court has jurisdiction to entertain a case and to find the existence of legal authority, it does not have power to control the exercise of the attorney general’s discretion as to whether he will take action in any particular cases of contempt for nonsupport.

      When grouped together, the powers and duties of the local boundary commission are as follows: (1) To consider any local government boundary change (Alaska Constitution art. X, § 12); (2) to present proposed changes to the legislature (Alaska Const., art. X, § 12; § 7, ch. 64, SLA 1959); (3) (subject to law) to establish procedures whereby boundaries may be adjusted by local action (Alaska Const., art. X, § 12); (4) to make studies of local government boundary problems (Sec. 7, ch. 64, SLA 1959); (5) to develop proposed standards and procedures for changing local boundary lines (Sec. 7, ch. 64, SLA 1959); (6) to hold hearings on proposed boundary changes (Sec. 7, ch. 64, SLA 1959). 1959 Alas.

        There are questions of public policy to be determined in annexation proceedings which are beyond the province of the court.
        Examples are the desirability of annexation, as expressed in published standards.
        Judicial techniques are not well adapted to resolving these questions.
        In that sense, these may be described as “political questions,” beyond the compass of judicial review.
        But other annexation issues, such as whether statutory notice requirements were followed, are readily decided by traditional judicial techniques. United States Smelting, Ref. &amp; Mining Co. v. Local Boundary Comm'n, 489 P.2d 140 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The policy decision as to the mode of annexation is an exercise of lawfully vested administrative discretion which the supreme court will review only to determine if administrative, legislative or constitutional mandates were disobeyed or if the action constituted an abuse of discretion.

        underlying the statutory requirement of annexation standards. First, such standards expose the basic decision-making processes of the commission to public view. Second, the standards guide local governments in making annexation decisions and in preparing proposals for the commission. Third, annexation standards objectify the criteria of decision-making and delineate the battleground for a public hearing. Port Valdez Co. v. Valdez, 522 P.2d 1147 (Alaska 1974).

      <p>
       Applicant for a permit to mine a mineral deposit received procedural due process because the administrative hearing was appropriate given the limited number of questions of fact the hearing was intended to resolve and the applicant did not show prejudice. Moreover, the applicant expressly chose to proceed before a communications file of the State of Alaska, Department of Natural Resources, was released and failed to adequately demonstrate how the late release of documents prejudiced it.

       Company had an interest in the production of hydrocarbons from beneath its lease, and the decision of the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to exclude that acreage resulted in lost revenue to the company, adversely affecting its financial interests; this alleged injury was sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirement that the company be aggrieved by DNR's decision, and thus the company had standing to appeal DNR's decision to the commissioner.

A regulation may not impose a restriction on document recording unless the restriction is required by statute or furthers a legitimate administrative need of the recorder; a “legitimate administrative need” includes ensuring the legibility of the documents and identifying the parties, the capacity of each party, and the affected property.

     <p>
      Section 77, ch. 63, SLA 1993 enacted a subsection (c) for this section that is almost identical to that enacted by § 13, ch. 74, SLA 1993 and set out above. The only difference between the two is that the latter contains the words “and indirect” after the word “direct”. Because § 13, ch. 74, SLA 1993 was the later enactment and had an immediate effective date, the amendment made by ch. 63 will not be codified.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 1998, in the last sentence of (d) of this section, “subsection” was substituted for “section” to correct a manifest error in ch. 90, SLA 1995.

       In determining whether a regulation is authorized by statute the Court of Appeals of Alaska looks to four things:
       First, the scope of authority conferred by the authorizing statute; second, the extent to which the regulation is in accordance with “standards prescribed by other provisions of law”; third, the extent to which the regulation is consistent with the authorizing statute; and fourth, the extent to which the regulation is reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose of the authorizing statute.

       By expressly adopting the pertinent portions of the federal regulations and revising them as necessary to apply them to Alaska roadways, the Department acted consistent with its statutory authority and the legislature’s objective; defendant did not show that the State lacked the authority to adopt and enforce commercial motor vehicle regulations patterned on the corresponding federal regulations, nor did he show that the state’s commercial motor vehicle regulations were unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

       In determining whether a regulation is authorized by statute the Court of Appeals of Alaska looks to four things:
       First, the scope of authority conferred by the authorizing statute; second, the extent to which the regulation is in accordance with “standards prescribed by other provisions of law”; third, the extent to which the regulation is consistent with the authorizing statute; and fourth, the extent to which the regulation is reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose of the authorizing statute.

       Legislature authorized the Alaska Board of Fisheries to enact regulations that allow the Department of Fish and Game to establish harvest limits through the permitting process; the Board has been enacting this type of regulation for decades, i.e., regulations that allow the Department of Fish and Game to set harvest limits and other harvesting restrictions through the permitting process, and the Legislature has never taken action to prohibit or restrict the Board’s practice. State v. Estrada, 315 P.3d 688 (Alaska Ct. App. 2013), rev'd, 362 P.3d 1021 (Alaska 2015).

        Agency cannot adopt future amendments to code, etc., by reference. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the Legislative Affairs Agency [now Department of Law] drafting manual, an administrative agency may not adopt by reference a code or set of standards from another state, the federal government, or a private organization and provide that future amendments as they become effective are being adopted also. Northern Lights Motel v. Sweaney, 561 P.2d 1176 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       One reason for the prohibition against delegation of the future law-making power of the state to private groups is that when amendments are adopted by these groups the public does not necessarily receive notice of, or have an opportunity to comment on or criticize, the amendments, as it does when they are adopted by the legislature or promulgated under this chapter.

     <p>
      Where a lengthy regulation on one subject is to be proposed the best policy would be to briefly summarize the content and purpose of the regulation. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 26.
     </p>
     <p>
      If only a very short regulation is proposed then ordinarily it would be most practicable to set forth the regulation in full. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 26.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a great many regulations are to be promulgated which are of a varied nature, such as fish and game regulations, or oil leasing regulations, then the only practical thing to do would be to give a general listing of the subjects to be covered, a reference to any other existing body of regulations being adopted, amended, or superseded that might be informative to the particular public or industry concerned (such as a reference to existing regulations of a state agency or department or to existing federal regulations) and a brief listing of any significant changes proposed if an existing body of regulations is to be effected.
      In such case it would be well to indicate that copies of the proposed regulations can be obtained from the agency in order to indicate the agency has done everything reasonably possible to give the public affected by its regulations an opportunity to familiarize itself with the regulations and to prepare itself to submit its views at the hearing.
      This should constitute substantial compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and would serve the purpose of the act. 1959 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 26.
     </p>
     <p>
      And when a summary of a large number of proposed regulations is to be used it would be safe for the departments and agencies of the state government to follow the Ohio and federal practice and to give notice of the areas in which regulations may or may not be promulgated by listing the subject matter to which the proposed rules would relate. 1959 Alas.

        The rule-making function of an administrative agency frequently resembles the legislative process of passing a statute.
       </b>
       Each entity determines the need for a particular enactment in light of chosen policies; each has procedures for the expression of views upon the merits of the proposal; and each, after consideration of the relevant policies and arguments, decides whether to adopt the proposed enactment.
       When administrative rule making is based upon clear authority from the legislature to formulate policy in the adoption of regulations, the rule-making activity takes on a quasi-legislative aspect. Under proper standards, such delegations of legislative power to administer agencies are constitutional. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Natural Resources
       </b>
       are subject to the rule-making provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (AS 44.62) and must be adopted according to the procedures set forth therein.
       Among the required procedures for adoption of regulations are notice of the proposed adoption, a public hearing in which any interested person may submit statements to the agency, filing of the regulation, if adopted, with the secretary of state (now the lieutenant governor), and publication. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).

        Agency cannot adopt future amendments to code by reference. —

      </p>
      <p>
       According to the Legislative Affairs Agency (now Department of Law) drafting manual, an administrative agency may not adopt by reference a code or set of standards from another state, the federal government or a private organization and provide that future amendments as they become effective are being adopted also. Northern Lights Motel v. Sweaney, 561 P.2d 1176 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       One reason for the prohibition against delegation of the future law-making power of the state to private groups is that when amendments are adopted by these groups the public does not necessarily receive notice of, or have an opportunity to comment on or criticize, the amendments, as it does when they are adopted by the legislature or promulgated under the Alaska Administrative Procedure Act.

       Where no hearing was ever held regarding whether regulations of the board of game were consistent with the subsistence law prior to their adoption as subsistence regulations, the challenged tag/fee and sealing regulations, as subsistence regulations applicable to the taking and use of brown/grizzly bears in the affected game management units, were invalid. State v. Morry, 836 P.2d 358 (Alaska 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Charges were dismissed against certain fishermen for violating the limits placed on subsistence fishing permits because the Department of Fish and Game’s failure to comply with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act when it promulgated the harvest limits rendered them inapplicable. The core characteristics of a regulation were present, the fishermen’s activities were restricted by the addition of specific, concrete content to the general rule, the public was not provided the participation required by statute, and the limit was first announced after it was adopted, in a letter the Department sent to community leaders.

       Where the informative summary published by the Board of Fisheries offered details of matters to be considered in setting harvest levels for sockeye salmon and adequately informed interested fishermen of the subject matter to be considered, there was no “substantial failure” to comply with the informative summary requirement of the Administrative Procedures Act. Thus, the trial court correctly concluded that the board complied with subsection (a)(3). Gilbert v. Dept. of Fish &amp; Game, Bd. of Fisheries, 803 P.2d 391 (Alaska 1990).

       Alaska Board of Game’s amendment to Alaska Admin. Code tit. 5, § 92.072(d) was properly noticed where the notice set out proposed changes to unit 13 seasons for caribou and moose, as well as proposed changes to community subsistence harvest areas and conditions, and was thus sufficient to comply with this section.

        Regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Natural Resources
       </b>
       are subject to the rule-making provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (AS 44.62) and must be adopted according to the procedures set forth therein.
       Among the required procedures for adoption of regulations are notice of the proposed adoption, a public hearing in which any interested person may submit statements to the agency, filing of the regulation, if adopted, with the secretary of state (now the lieutenant governor), and publication.

        Agency cannot adopt future amendments to code by reference. —

      </p>
      <p>
       An administrative agency may not adopt by reference a code or set of standards from another state, the federal government, or a private organization and provide that future amendments as they become effective are being adopted also. Northern Lights Motel v. Sweaney, 561 P.2d 1176 (Alaska 1977) (revision of note appearing in main pamphlet).
      </p>
      <p>
       One reason for the prohibition against delegation of the future law-making power of the state to private groups is that when amendments are adopted by these groups the public does not necessarily receive notice of, or have an opportunity to comment on or criticize, the amendments, as it does when they are adopted by the legislature or promulgated under the Alaska Administrative Procedure Act.

      </p>
      <p>
       Charges were dismissed against certain fishermen for violating the limits placed on subsistence fishing permits because the Department of Fish and Game’s failure to comply with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act when it promulgated the harvest limits rendered them inapplicable. The core characteristics of a regulation were present, the fishermen’s activities were restricted by the addition of specific, concrete content to the general rule, the public was not provided the participation required by statute, and the limit was first announced after it was adopted in a letter the Department sent to community leaders.

      If a regulation adopted by an agency under this chapter is primarily legislative, the regulation has prospective effect only.
      A regulation adopted under this chapter that is primarily an “interpretative regulation” has retroactive effect only if the agency adopting it has adopted no earlier inconsistent regulation and has followed no earlier course of conduct inconsistent with the regulation.
      Silence or failure to follow any course of conduct is considered earlier inconsistent conduct.

       Fishermen who challenged an agency regulation setting a maximum number for entry into a fishery were “interested parties” even though no actual harm had yet resulted (since they had not yet been finally denied entry) and even though they had not shown that any future harm was inevitable; their showing of possible future harm was sufficient.

        The distinction between legislative and interpretative rule making
       </b>
       is a helpful one when reviewing regulations adopted by state administrative agencies. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference in judicial attitude toward certain administrative rules has been characterized as a distinction between “legislative regulations” and “interpretative regulations.” “Legislative rule” has been defined as “the product of an exercise of legislative power by an administrative agency, pursuant to a grant of legislative power by the legislative body.” “Interpretative rules” are rules which do not rest upon a legislative grant of power (whether explicit or inexplicit) to the agency to make law. The distinction is not always easy to draw, since interpretative rules sometimes rest upon statutory authority to issue them.
       The distinction can be demonstrated better by examining representative cases than by an abstract definition. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Two distinct types of administrative decisions on questions of law. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       One type involves questions in which the particularized experience and knowledge of the administrative personnel goes into the determination.
       When this type of question is presented to the court for review, deference should be given to the administrative interpretation, since the expertise of the agency would be of material assistance to the court.
       The amount of deference will vary depending upon the apparent degree of reasonableness of the administrative decision and the degree to which the problem involves knowledge peculiar to an industry or business.
       The other kind of case presents questions of law in which knowledge and experience in the industry afford little guidance toward a proper consideration of the legal issues. These cases usually concern statutory interpretation or other analysis of legal relationships about which courts have specialized knowledge and experience. Consequently, courts are at least as capable of deciding this kind of question as an administrative agency. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The supreme court has distinguished between two types of questions that may confront a court in judicial review of administrative action.
       Where the agency decision involves the formulation of fundamental policy or the particularized expertise and experience of administrative personnel, the court will defer to the administrative decision, inquiring only whether it has a reasonable basis.
       On the other hand, where the issues to be resolved turn on statutory interpretation, the knowledge and expertise of the agency are not conclusive of the intent of the legislature in passing a statute.
       Statutory interpretation is within the scope of the court’s special competency, and it is the court’s duty to consider the statute independently. Hood v. State, Workmen's Comp. Bd., 574 P.2d 811 (Alaska 1978).

      <p>
       <b>
        Manner of review. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an administrative regulation has been adopted in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act, and it appears that the legislature has intended to commit to the agency discretion as to the particular matter that forms the subject of the regulation, the supreme court will review the regulation in the following manner: First, it will ascertain whether the regulation is consistent with and reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of the statutory provisions conferring rule-making authority on the agency.
       This aspect of review insures that the agency has not exceeded the power delegated by the legislature.
       Second, the supreme court will determine whether the regulation is reasonable and not arbitrary.
       This latter inquiry is proper in the review of any legislative enactment. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).

       When a regulation has been adopted under a delegation of authority from the legislature to the administrative agency to formulate policies and to act in the place of the legislature, the supreme court should not examine the content of the regulation to judge its wisdom, but should exercise a scope of review not unlike that exercised with respect to a statute. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).

        “Reasonable basis” standard of review. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasonable basis approach should be used for the most part in cases concerning administrative expertise as to either complex subject matter or fundamental policy formulations. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971); Stevenson v. Burgess, 570 P.2d 728 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Application of the reasonable basis test is extremely useful where the administrative action under review resembles executive as opposed to legislative or judicial activity. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasonable basis approach, in the review of agency action which is essentially executive in character, recognizes that the application of law to facts in an administrative setting may require techniques quite different from those traditionally associated with judicial functions. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is primarily a question of a statutory interpretation and legislative intent, it is a question of whether “the administrative agency has acted within the scope of its authority” and concerns “statutory interpretations requiring the special competency of the courts.”
       Therefore, the reasonable basis test is not the appropriate standard of review. Stevenson v. Burgess, 570 P.2d 728 (Alaska 1977).

       Action taken contrary to this section is voidable. A lawsuit to void an action taken in violation of this section must be filed in superior court within 180 days after the date of the action. A member of a governmental body may not be named in an action to enforce this section in the member’s personal capacity. A governmental body that violates or is alleged to have violated this section may cure the violation or alleged violation by holding another meeting in compliance with notice and other requirements of this section and conducting a substantial and public reconsideration of the matters considered at the original meeting. If the court finds that an action is void, the governmental body may discuss and act on the matter at another meeting held in compliance with this section. A court may hold that an action taken at a meeting held in violation of this section is void only if the court finds that, considering all of the circumstances, the public interest in compliance with this section outweighs the harm that would be caused to the public interest and to the public entity by voiding the action.

      The mental health lands working group is not a public body covered by the Open Meetings Act, and its meetings are not covered by the Open Meetings Act. That working group was not a formally established entity with a specific charge to take specific action or give specific advice, and the activities of the group were not financed by public money. It consisted of individuals, including state department heads, meeting merely to begin settlement discussions to resolve the legal issues in a lawsuit. January 1, 1992, Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The notice requirements of the Open Meetings Act require that the Museum Collections Advisory Committee publish a schedule of its fixed monthly meetings twice yearly, stating the date, time, and place of the meetings. For unscheduled meetings, the public may be notified by public service announcements on the radio, as long as there is confidence that the announcements will in fact be made; but regardless of the media used, at least three days notice should be given. December 30, 1992, Op. Att’y Gen.

      The present practice of allowing boards and commissions to conduct routine business by mail does not violate the Open Meetings Act. It neither constitutes a meeting nor is it motivated by an intent to circumvent the Open Meetings Act. Rather, mail voting is expressly authorized by statute. It also furthers sound policy by reducing both administrative costs and administrative burdens. July 5, 1994 Op. Att’y Gen.

       A private meeting between a quorum of the Anchorage Municipal Assembly and a developer to discuss in detail the developer’s application for rezoning violated this section; a “meeting” for purposes of the Open Meetings Act includes every step of the deliberative and decision-making process when a governmental unit meets to transact public business.

       Neither the Department of Corrections nor the Department of Administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act, because the act does not apply to informal groups of state employees who have no power to take collective action by vote, as it would be impossible to apply the act to the everyday dealings of public employees when they meet with each other and those outside of state government in the day-to-day conduct of state’s business.

       Because the attorney-client privilege operates concurrently with this section although it is not an expressed exception, the board’s executive session, called to discuss the status of this case with its attorney, did not violate this section. The privilege should not be applied blindly. It is not enough that the public body be involved in litigation. Rather, the rationale for the confidentiality of the specific communication at issue must be one that the confidentiality doctrine seeks to protect: candid discussion of the facts and litigation strategies. The privilege thus should be applied only when the revelation of the communication will injure the public interest or there is some other recognized purpose in keeping the communication confidential.

       In assessing the remedial benefits to be gained in light of the Open Meeting Act’s goals when fashioning a remedy for an at-will employee who was terminated during a meeting that violated the act, the superior court should consider the goals of maximizing informed and principled decision-making in individual cases and deterring future violations, as well as the goad of encouraging “public participation and input in the operation of government.” The superior court should weigh these benefits against the prejudice likely to accrue to the public if the employee is awarded back pay and benefits. Ordinarily, there must be a nexus between the violation of the act and the termination. However, the superior court could conclude that the public body’s conduct was particularly egregious and that the goal of deterring such conduct in the future is paramount. In such a case, the superior court could conclude that, even in the absence of a nexus, the employee is entitled to at least his costs and full reasonable attorney’s fees. Revelle v. Marston, 898 P.2d 917 (Alaska 1995).

      The purpose of the adjudication procedure is to prescribe a fair procedure for determinations of fact; this is indicated by paragraph (d)(4), which excepts from the adjudication procedure related matters that in their context do not relate to procedure. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 10.

      The policy of subsection (d) of this section is to limit the adjudication procedure set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act to procedural matters, and matters regarding which the agency must make substantial determinations of fact. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 10.

      The accusation and hearing procedure set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act was not applicable to the suspension or revocation of liquor licenses by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board after a conviction of a licensee of certain offenses as set forth in former AS 04.15.100(b). 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 10.

      Where the power to suspend or revoke a license is implied by the statutory authority to issue a license, it is clear that suspension or revocation may be ordered only after formal accusation and hearing as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. 1963 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 10.

      Not all of this chapter, as it relates to workers’ compensation proceedings, has been repealed by implication. For example, the Alaska Workers’ Compensation Act is silent as to judicial review and the scope of judicial review.

       Alaska Workers' Compensation Commission's conclusion that the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board did not abuse its discretion in excluding attorney witnesses' testimony was incorrect because the Board prevented them from testifying at all and did not sustain objections to specific questions eliciting irrelevant information, even though the proposed testimony was relevant; at the time the claimants sought to call the witnesses, the Board did not have the information they could have supplied Rusch v.

       Given the absence of any Workers’ Compensation Board rule pertaining to medical reports that parallels its affidavit rule, and in light of the absence of a system requiring notice of intention to cross-examine to be filed before hearing when medical reports are served upon opposing parties pursuant to the Board’s current medical report rules, the superior court erred in its conclusion that appellants had waived their right to cross-examine the doctors who had authored the reports.

     <p>
      A person whose license is revoked or suspended may petition the agency for reinstatement or reduction of penalty after one year from the effective date of the decision or from the date of the denial of a similar petition.
      The agency shall give notice to the attorney general of the filing of the petition, and the attorney general and the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to present either oral or written argument before the agency.
      The agency shall decide the petition, and the decision must include the reasons for the decision.
      This section does not apply if the statutes dealing with the particular agency contain different provisions for reinstatement or reduction of penalty.

       While a doctor was barred under the memorandum of agreement from appealing the merits of the Alaska State Medical Board’s (Board) decision to discipline her, she was not barred from challenging the enforceability of the underlying agreement which granted the Board power to act; to bar an appeal of the agreement’s validity related to the violation of a condition would presumably mean also finding a waiver of the right to challenge the validity of the agreement on other grounds, such as fraud or duress, which would be unreasonable.

        Questions for review. —

      </p>
      <p>
       One type of administrative decision on questions of law involves questions in which the particularized experience and knowledge of the administrative personnel go into the determination.
       When this type of question is presented to the court for review, deference should be given to the administrative interpretation, since the expertise of the agency would be of material assistance to the court.
       The other kind of case presents questions of law in which knowledge and experience in the industry afford little guidance toward a proper consideration of the legal issues. These cases usually concern statutory interpretations or other analysis of legal relationships about which courts have specialized knowledge and experience.
       Consequently, courts are at least as capable of deciding this kind of question as is an administrative agency. Swindel v. Kelly, 499 P.2d 291 (Alaska 1972).

        Four principal standards of review. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In interpreting this section the supreme court has recognized at least four principal standards of review of administrative decisions.
       These are the “substantial evidence test” for questions of fact; the “reasonable basis test” for questions of law involving agency expertise; the “substitution of judgment test” for questions of law where no expertise is involved; and the “reasonable and not arbitrary test” for review of administrative regulations. Jager v. State, 537 P.2d 1100 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The reasonable basis test is as follows:
       </b>
       In cases where a decision involves administrative expertise as to either complex subject matter or fundamental policy formulations, deference should be given to an administrative determination if it has a reasonable basis in law and fact. Alaska Pub. Utils. Comm'n v. Chugach Elec. Ass'n, 580 P.2d 687 (Alaska 1978), overruled, Juneau v. Thibodeau, 595 P.2d 626 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Use of rational basis test. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasonable basis approach should be used for the most part in cases concerning administrative expertise as to either complex subject matter or fundamental policy formulations. Swindel v. Kelly, 499 P.2d 291 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Application of the reasonable basis test is extremely useful where the administrative action under review resembles executive as opposed to legislative or judicial activity, where the decision under review clearly has nothing to do with the agency’s rule making function. Swindel v. Kelly, 499 P.2d 291 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The “rational basis” test applied in a case involving the interpretation of the Multistate Tax Compact, since interpretation of that compact depends upon the “particularized experience and knowledge of the administrative personnel.” Department of Revenue v. Parsons Corp., 843 P.2d 1238 (Alaska 1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 940, 113 S. Ct. 2416, 124 L. Ed. 2d 638 (U.S. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Regulatory Commission of Alaska had a reasonable basis for denying as untimely under 3 AAC 48.110(d) the shippers’ challenge of 1986 through 1996 rates because the shippers did not timely petition to intervene in another company’s protest, they did not protest any of the suspended rates filed during that time period, they did not petition to intervene as to the justness and reasonableness of the rates for any additional years after 1987, and the settlement order clearly set out the need to protest and the fact that, absent a protest, the commission was going to accept the settlement and rates correctly calculated under the TAPS Settlement Methodology.

      <p>
       Abuse of discretion by agencies is established on review if the agency’s findings are not supported by “substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.” In re Peterson, 499 P.2d 304 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The substantial evidence criterion has been adopted as the appropriate scope of review in regard to appeals from administrative agencies to the superior court. Pan Am. Petro. Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., 455 P.2d 12 (Alaska 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is well settled in Alaska that an initial order of the Workers’ Compensation Board should be reviewed in accordance with the principle of substantial evidence. Interior Paint Co. v. Rodgers, 522 P.2d 164 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       The substantial evidence standard restricts the court on review to considering only whether the administrative findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, and whether the award is contrary to law. Interior Paint Co. v. Rodgers, 522 P.2d 164 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       The standard of review of agency findings of fact is that the findings will be set aside if they are not supported by substantial evidence on the whole record. Inherent in this standard is a requirement, in part statutory, that the facts found be based on evidence in the record. City of Fairbanks v. Alaska Pub. Utils. Comm'n, 611 P.2d 493 (Alaska 1980).

       Sanctions against a real estate appraiser were not supported by the evidence where the expert witness for the state neither viewed the appraised properties at issue nor presented supporting citations for his statements regarding the standards and practices of real estate appraisers in Alaska.

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The requirement that the facts found be based on evidence in the record serves three purposes:
       </b>
       First, it helps to ensure that the agency does not make decisions that have no adequate basis in fact; second, it gives opposing parties the opportunity to challenge the agency’s reasoning process and the correctness of the decision; and third, it affords reviewing courts the opportunity to evaluate the decision.

        The substantial evidence standard is employed by the superior court

       Superior court had power to remand worker’s compensation matter to the Alaska Workers’ Compensation Board while appeal was pending because an injured worker had presented some evidence at his first hearing that no one had informed him of his right to request an independent medical examination, although he did not make an explicit legal argument related to the issue; superior court in remanding the matter ensured that both parties could present evidence to support their arguments and rebut the other party’s arguments.

       The combination of investigative and judicial functions within an agency does not violate due process; a board may make preliminary factual inquiry on its own in order to determine if charges should be filed.
       And minimum requirements of procedural due process are not offended by the attorney for the agency acting as advisor on procedural matters. In re Cornelius, 521 P.2d 497 (Alaska 1974).

       Due process requires some separation between those persons prosecuting a complaint and those adjudicating it, since the prosecutor, who has a “probable partiality,” should not be in a position to influence the decision makers, but there may be some combination of these functions within a particular agency.

       In a proceeding before the Alaska Board of Workers’ Compensation, an ex parte communication was violative of accepted standards of conduct for an adjudicatory body where one of the board members, with three other board members present, initiated a conversation with two witnesses of the employer, one of whom was the employer’s rehabilitation expert.
       In effect, a representative of one of the parties was privately communicating his recommendations to the decision makers. Louisiana Pac. Corp. v. Koons, 816 P.2d 1379 (Alaska 1991).

        The label placed on a particular statement by an administrative agency does not determine the applicability of this chapter. Kenai Peninsula Fisherman's Coop. Ass'n v. State, 628 P.2d 897 (Alaska 1981).

        Though certain provisions in a policy and procedure manual used by the Department of Natural Resources might plausibly have been considered regulations, those provisions had no bearing on a case in which they fell within the scope of the internal management exception to this chapter because they merely listed statutory procedures for an adjudicator to follow. Messerli v. Department of Natural Resources, 768 P.2d 1112 (Alaska 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a policy of the Child Support Enforcement Division (now the Child Support Services Agency) was a “regulation” within the meaning of this section and was not validly adopted, it would have been entitled to some degree of deference if it reflected a reasonable interpretation of statutory law. Flanigin v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 946 P.2d 446 (Alaska 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because an administrative interpretation of a statute governing a pipeline right-of-way appraisal did not impose new substantive requirements but simply interpreted and applied the plain language of the statute, it was not a regulation as defined in paragraph (a)(3) and thus was not subject to the notice and public comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.

       <p>
        Although the court recognized that some elements of the third-party verification requirement for a claim of experience warranting waiver of the engineering exam resembled a regulation subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, the Act’s overall purpose is to reduce the risk of arbitrary application and to inform the public of regulations. Here, plaintiff did not demonstrate that the third-party verification requirement in the application instructions is obscure or creates a meaningful risk of arbitrary application so as to justify creation of a regulation.

        Trial court properly upheld the denial of a company’s appeal of “permit administration fees” issued by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation in connection with the company’s administrative appeals of air quality control permits where the Department’s interpretation of AS 46.14.240(c)(3) was a commonsense interpretation, and was therefore not subject to the Alaska Administrative Procedure Act’s notice and comment requirements in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

         “Regulation.” —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        “Regulation” encompasses many statements made by administrative agencies, including policies and guides to enforcement. Kenai Peninsula Fisherman's Coop. Ass'n v. State, 628 P.2d 897 (Alaska 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under paragraph (2) of subsection (a), one of the indicia of a regulation is that it implements, interprets, or makes specific the law enforced or administered by the state agency. Kenai Peninsula Fisherman's Coop. Ass'n v. State, 628 P.2d 897 (Alaska 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the residential/recreational distinction policy in the Department of Natural Resources Procedure Manual appeared to bear both of the Kenai indicia, and since the term “regulation” has been read to include “policies and guides to enforcement,” that part of the manual was a “regulation”. Reichmann v. State, Dep't of Nat. Res., 917 P.2d 1197 (Alaska 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        A decision of the Department of Natural Resources that a mining company owed back royalties because it erroneously calculated its “adjusted gross value” was not a “regulation” within the meaning of the Administrative Procedures Act. Usibelli Coal Mine, Inc. v. State, Dep't of Nat. Res., 921 P.2d 1134 (Alaska 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a 20-foot visibility requirement for marking of horses included both core characteristics of a regulation in that the requirement was developed precisely to interpret, make specific, and implement the statutory requirement that a mark or brand show distinctly and also to deal with the public, rather than to operate as in internal guideline, the fact that the regulation did not satisfy the procedural standards of the administrative procedure statute rendered it invalid. Jerrel v. Department of Natural Resources, 999 P.2d 138 (Alaska 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Division of Governmental Coordination’s interpretation of its major energy facility regulation was not an addition to a regulation involving requirements of substance, but instead was the interpretation of the regulation according to its own terms; the Division’s interpretation thus was not a “regulation” within the meaning of paragraph (a)(3) of this section and did not need to be promulgated in accordance with the Alaska Administrative Procedure Act. Alaska Ctr. for the Env't v. State, 80 P.3d 231 (Alaska 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        State of Alaska Department of Health and Social Services’ (DHSS) protocol was not a regulation that had to be promulgated pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act; DHSS’s properly promulgated regulation authorizing the use of “statistically valid sampling methodologies” was sufficient.

        Bristol Bay Area Plan affects the public in a limited way, but it does not itself alter the rights or interests of the parties, as is required of a regulation; therefore, it is not a regulation under the Administrative Procedures Act.

       <p>
        Prior department employee acknowledged that he failed to apply and interpret the statute correctly when he recommended reimbursement for the borough's previous bonds, but his failure to abide by applicable law did not constitute a regulation, and the department's current interpretation corrected a previous oversight; the department was not required to comply with notice and comment provisions before determining that the borough's bonds did not comply with statutory requirements.

       <p>
        Alaska Department of Revenue (DOR) did not have to meet Alaska Administrative Procedure Act rulemaking requirements when interpreting “economically interdependent” in former AS 43.55.013(j) because (1) the decision was a commonsense interpretation of the statute, since the decision added no requirements of substance, (2) the interpretation was foreseeable, given the applicable tax regime's purposes, (3) the decision did not depart from a prior interpretation, since DOR's internal documents were not official policy positions and, as a whole, did not depart from prior interpretations of “economically interdependent,” (4) this was the first time the phrase was interpreted, and (5) DOR reviewed DOR's precedent.

       </p>
       <p>
        While the board of fisheries did have the authority to establish priorities of use between recreational and commercial fisheries of the salmon stocks in the Upper Cook Inlet, the policy and option establishing these priorities were regulations that should have been adopted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Kenai Peninsula Fisherman's Coop. Ass'n v. State, 628 P.2d 897 (Alaska 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a Board of Fisheries policy on managing mixed stock fell squarely within the definition of “regulation” contained in paragraph (a)(3) and, therefore, was required to be implemented pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act but had not been, the regulation promulgated to further that policy fell within the ambit of the board’s authority and was reasonably necessary to “conserve” and “develop” fish resources; hence, the regulation was upheld.

       <p>
        The supreme court has declined to construe the phrase “internal management of a state agency” to encompass all individuals and activities affected by regulations promulgated by the lieutenant governor during a statewide election. Coghill v. Boucher, 511 P.2d 1297 (Alaska 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supervision of personnel and activities relating to the conduct of a statewide election is not the same as the management of employees and internal affairs of a state agency. Executive organization of the election machinery goes well beyond the lieutenant governor’s control of his own staff and their actions. Coghill v. Boucher, 511 P.2d 1297 (Alaska 1973).

      et seq. is not withdrawn or diminished during the sunset (or wind-down) year. The commission should comply with the Sunset Law by preparing for the exigency of closing shop; this does not mean, however, that the commission cannot carry on its usual business of regulating utilities and pipelines. Since many of the commission’s statutory duties are mandatory, the commission must reconcile performance of those duties with the provisions of the Sunset Law. The commission should continue to perform its statutory duties to the extent possible while developing a plan to phase out its work by the close of the sunset year. In deciding how to do this, the commission has a considerable amount of discretion. June 21, 1994 Op. Att’y Gen.

      </p>
      <p>
       It is apparent that if “given” modified “money,” “labor,” “materials” and “supplies,” each term would have a double modifier and the statute would be subject to construction not contemplated by the legislature. State v. Zia, Inc., 556 P.2d 1257 (Alaska 1976).

      </p>
      <p>
       For the purposes of the filing of contract claims, “promptly” is not defined in calendar terms. State v. Zia, Inc., 556 P.2d 1257 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the legislature had intended to define “promptly” for other claims (including contract claims) and had a period of time in mind, it can be assumed that a reasonable legislature would have so legislated.
       In the absence of those intentions, no definite time limit should delimit “promptly” as applied to contract claims under subsection (a). State v. Zia, Inc., 556 P.2d 1257 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature chose to define “promptly” only for medical claims. State v. Zia, Inc., 556 P.2d 1257 (Alaska 1976).

        Breach of good faith covenant not tort. —

      </p>
      <p>
       As a matter of law, a covenant of good faith and fair dealing is an implied component of any contract. Breach of this covenant in an ordinary commercial contract does not constitute a tort. Creating a broader tort remedy would disrupt the certainty of commercial transactions to allow parties to escape contractual allocation of losses. State, Dep't of Nat. Res. v. Transamerica Premier Ins. Co., 856 P.2d 766 (Alaska 1993).

        “Bad faith” by state not found. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The belief of the state that a suit in superior court would be costly to the contractor does not prove a premeditated scheme to reject all of the contractor’s cost claims in “bad faith”. Similarly, the fact that the contractor had to break down his claim item by item does not indicate bad faith, because the use of the “total cost” method in calculating claims is not allowed. State, Dep't of Nat. Res. v. Transamerica Premier Ins. Co., 856 P.2d 766 (Alaska 1993).

      </p>
      <p>
       Where, in its complaint, a corporation sought recovery against the state for money expended for labor, materials, administrative expenses, design and lost profits due to breach of contract, it sought “reimbursement for money expended . . . for the state . . .” as contemplated by this section.

        Project owner not liable as design professional. —

      </p>
      <p>
       To expose a project owner to liability as a design professional might negate the ability of contracting parties to allocate and bargain for risk of loss in commercial transaction. Therefore, even if the owner negligently provides defective plans and specifications, which cause economic loss to the contractor in the course of performance, the contractor’s action for the owner’s breach is in contract, not tort. Also a project owner does not assume the duties of a design professional through its review of the project plans and specifications or its assignment of an on-site inspector. State, Dep't of Nat. Res. v. Transamerica Premier Ins. Co., 856 P.2d 766 (Alaska 1993).

       This chapter applies to actions for breach of contract against the Alaska Legislature, but the exhaustion of remedies requirement was waived with regard to a plaintiff who sought compensation for performing legislative consultation because this chapter had not previously been construed to apply to non-executive branch claims; the plaintiff’s one-year delay in filing the action was not unreasonable given his assumption that the six-year statute of limitations for contract actions was applicable; and the claimant had not ignored the administrative process entirely, but had requested payment from the Legislative Council and had sought reconsideration when that claim was denied.

The notification shall include the amount of the capital reserve fund to be established, the amount of bonds proposed to be issued, and the total cost of the project for which the bonds are to be issued.  The notification shall be accompanied by an estimate by the authority of the need to withdraw money from the capital reserve fund during the term of the bond issue, the amount that it may be necessary to withdraw, and the time at which withdrawals are estimated to be needed.  The authority shall annually prepare a revised estimate, considering the same factors, and a statement of all withdrawals that have occurred from the date of issuance of the bonds to the end of the calendar year.  The revised estimate and statement shall be submitted to the state bond committee and the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee by January 30 of the succeeding year.

The authority is authorized to include this pledge and agreement of the state, insofar as it refers to holders of bonds of the authority, in a contract with the holders, and insofar as it relates to a federal agency, in a contract with the federal agency.

      All bonds issued under this chapter are issued by a body corporate and public of this state and for an essential public and governmental purpose and the bonds and the interest and income on and from the bonds and all income of the authority are exempt from taxation except for transfer, inheritance, and estate taxes.

      The bond bank authority consists of the following five directors: the commissioner of revenue, the commissioner of commerce, community, and economic development, who shall each be a director ex officio with voting privileges, and three directors appointed by the governor.

The three directors appointed by the governor serve at the governor’s pleasure for four-year terms. They must be residents of the state and qualified voters at the time of appointment and shall comply with the requirements of AS 39.50 (public official financial disclosure). Each director shall hold office for the term of appointment and until a successor has been appointed and qualified. A director is eligible for reappointment. A vacancy in a directorship occurring other than by expiration of term shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment but for the unexpired term only. Each director before entering upon the duties of office shall take and subscribe to an oath to perform the duties faithfully, impartially, and justly to the best of the director’s ability. A record of the oath shall be filed in the office of the governor.

      In connection with the transaction and purchase of bond anticipation notes, the bond bank authority may by agreement with the municipality impose any terms, conditions, and limitations as in its opinion are proper for the purposes and security of the bond bank authority and the holders of its bonds or notes.
      The failure of a municipality to comply with the agreement constitutes a failure of the municipality to pay principal of and interest on the bonds or notes, and the bond bank authority shall enforce all rights, remedies, and provisions of law as it has under this chapter or are elsewhere provided.

      A judgment against the bond bank authority may not be a charge or lien upon its property; however, nothing in this section applies to or limits the rights of the holder of bonds or notes to pursue a remedy for the enforcement of a pledge or lien given by the bond bank authority on its revenues or other money.

     <p>
      A pledge of revenues or other money made by the bond bank authority is binding from the time the pledge is made. Revenues or other money so pledged and thereafter received by the bond bank authority are immediately subject to the lien of the pledge without any further act, and the lien of a pledge is binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the bond bank authority, regardless of whether the parties have notice of the lien. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created needs to be filed or recorded except in the records of the bond bank authority.

       Capital reserve funds and capital reserve fund requirement.

     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t44c88a03s44.88.105ol1a">
       For the purpose of securing one or more issues of its bonds, the authority may establish one or more special funds, called “capital reserve funds”, and shall pay into those capital reserve funds the proceeds of the sale of its bonds and other money which may be made available to the authority from other sources for the purposes of the capital reserve funds. A capital reserve fund may be established only if the authority determines that the establishment of the fund would enhance the marketability of the bonds. Money in a capital reserve fund, except as provided in this section, may be used as required only for (1) the payment of the principal of, and interest on, bonds or of the sinking fund payments with respect to those bonds; (2) the purchase or redemption of the bonds; or (3) the payment of a redemption premium required to be paid when the bonds are redeemed before maturity. However, money in a capital reserve fund may not be withdrawn if the withdrawal would reduce the amount in the capital reserve fund to less than the capital reserve fund requirement, except for the purpose of making payment, when due, of principal, interest, redemption premiums on the bonds, and sinking fund payments when other money of the authority is not available for the payments. Income or interest earned by, or increment to, a capital reserve fund, from the investment of all or part of the fund, may be transferred by the authority to other funds or accounts of the authority if the transfer does not reduce the amount of the capital reserve fund below the capital reserve fund requirement.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c88a03s44.88.105ol1b">
       If the authority decides to issue bonds secured by a capital reserve fund, the bonds may not be issued if the amount in the capital reserve fund is less than the capital reserve fund requirement, unless the authority, at the time of issuance of the bonds, deposits in the capital reserve fund from the proceeds of the bonds to be issued or from other sources, an amount which, together with the amount then in the fund, is not less than the capital reserve fund requirement.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c88a03s44.88.105ol1c">
       In computing the amount of a capital reserve fund for the purpose of this section, securities in which all or a portion of the fund is invested shall be valued by a reasonable method established by the authority by resolution.  Valuation shall include the amount of interest earned or accrued as of the date of the valuation.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c88a03s44.88.105ol1d">
       The chair of the authority shall annually, not later than January 2, certify in writing to the governor and the legislature the amount, if any, required to restore a capital reserve fund to the capital reserve fund requirement. The legislature may appropriate to the authority the amount certified by the chair of the authority. The authority shall deposit the amounts appropriated under this subsection during a fiscal year in the proper capital reserve fund. Nothing in this section creates a debt or liability of the state.

     <p>
      When, due to an emergency resulting from the effects of enemy attack or an imminent enemy attack, it becomes imprudent, inexpedient, or impossible to conduct the affairs of state government at the normal location of the state capital, the governor shall, as often as the exigencies of the situation require, declare by proclamation an emergency temporary location or locations for the seat of government at a place or places, inside or outside the state, that would not normally be considered military target sites and that the governor may consider advisable under the circumstances.
      The governor shall take such action and issue such orders as may be necessary for an orderly transition to the emergency temporary location or locations.
      The temporary location or locations shall remain the emergency seat of government until the emergency is declared to be ended by the governor and the seat of government is returned to its normal location.

      The State of Alaska recognizes that the state’s economic prosperity is dependent on available, reliable, and affordable residential, commercial, and industrial energy to supply the state’s electric, heating, and transportation needs. The state also recognizes that worldwide supply and demand for fossil fuels and concerns about global climate change will affect the price of fossil fuels consumed by Alaskans and exported from the state to other markets. In establishing a state energy policy, the state further recognizes the immense diversity of the state’s geography, cultures, and resource availability. Therefore, it is the policy of the state to

The statement must read: “This publication was released by... (name of state agency)..., produced at a cost of $..... per copy to... (statement of purpose)..., and printed in...... (city and state where printed).” If the publication is required by law, the statement must also include: “This publication is required by...

This term does not encompass a convention for proposing amendments under Article V of the Constitution of the United States that is organized independently of this Compact based on the separate and distinct application of any State.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 3. “State” means one of the several States of the United States. Where contextually appropriate, the term “State” shall be construed to include all of its branches, departments, agencies, political subdivisions, and officers and representatives acting in their official capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 4. “Member State” means a State that has enacted, adopted and agreed to be bound to this Compact. For any State to qualify as a Member State with respect to any other State under this Compact, each such State must have enacted, adopted and agreed to be bound by substantively identical compact legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 5. “Compact Notice Recipients” means the Archivist of the United States, the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Office of the Secretary of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the Office of the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the chief executive officer of each State, and the presiding officer(s) of each house of the Legislatures of the several States.

      </p>
      <p>
       Section 7. “Balanced Budget Amendment” means the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Article
       _______________
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 1. Total outlays of the government of the United States shall not exceed total receipts of the government of the United States at any point in time unless the excess of outlays over receipts is financed exclusively by debt issued in strict conformity with this article.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2. Outstanding debt shall not exceed authorized debt, which initially shall be an amount equal to 105 percent of the outstanding debt on the effective date of this article. Authorized debt shall not be increased above its aforesaid initial amount unless such increase is first approved by the legislatures of the several states as provided in Section 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 3. From time to time, Congress may increase authorized debt to an amount in excess of its initial amount set by Section 2 only if it first publicly refers to the legislatures of the several states an unconditional, single subject measure proposing the amount of such increase, in such form as provided by law, and the measure is thereafter publicly and unconditionally approved by a simple majority of the legislatures of the several states, in such form as provided respectively by state law; provided that no inducement requiring an expenditure or tax levy shall be demanded, offered or accepted as a quid pro quo for such approval. If such approval is not obtained within sixty (60) calendar days after referral then the measure shall be deemed disapproved and the authorized debt shall thereby remain unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 4. Whenever the outstanding debt exceeds 98 percent of the debt limit set by Section 2, the President shall enforce said limit by publicly designating specific expenditures for impoundment in an amount sufficient to ensure outstanding debt shall not exceed the authorized debt. Said impoundment shall become effective thirty (30) days thereafter, unless Congress first designates an alternate impoundment of the same or greater amount by concurrent resolution, which shall become immediately effective. The failure of the President to designate or enforce the required impoundment is an impeachable misdemeanor. Any purported issuance or incurrence of any debt in excess of the debt limit set by Section 2 is void.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 5. No bill that provides for a new or increased general revenue tax shall become law unless approved by a two-thirds roll call vote of the whole number of each House of Congress. However, this requirement shall not apply to any bill that provides for a new end user sales tax which would completely replace every existing income tax levied by the government of the United States; or for the reduction or elimination of an exemption, deduction, or credit allowed under an existing general revenue tax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 6. For purposes of this article, “debt” means any obligation backed by the full faith and credit of the government of the United States; “outstanding debt” means all debt held in any account and by any entity at a given point in time; “authorized debt” means the maximum total amount of debt that may be lawfully issued and outstanding at any single point in time under this article; “total outlays of the government of the United States” means all expenditures of the government of the United States from any source; “total receipts of the government of the United States” means all tax receipts and other income of the government of the United States, excluding proceeds from its issuance or incurrence of debt or any type of liability; “impoundment” means a proposal not to spend all or part of a sum of money appropriated by Congress; and “general revenue tax” means any income tax, sales tax, or value-added tax levied by the government of the United States excluding imposts and duties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 7. This article is immediately operative upon ratification, self-enforcing, and Congress may enact conforming legislation to facilitate enforcement.”

       Section 1. This Compact governs each Member State to the fullest extent permitted by their respective constitutions, superseding and repealing any conflicting or contrary law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2. By becoming a Member State, each such State offers, promises and agrees to perform and comply strictly in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Compact, and has made such offer, promise and agreement in anticipation and consideration of, and in substantial reliance upon, such mutual and reciprocal performance and compliance by each other current and future Member State, if any. Accordingly, in addition to having the force of law in each Member State upon its respective effective date, this Compact and each of its Articles shall also be construed as contractually binding each Member State when: (a) at least one other State has likewise become a Member State by enacting substantively identical legislation adopting and agreeing to be bound by this Compact; and (b) notice of such State’s Member State status is or has been seasonably received by the Compact Administrator, if any, or otherwise by the chief executive officer of each other Member State.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 3. For purposes of determining Member State status under this Compact, as long as all other provisions of the Compact remain identical and operative on the same terms, legislation enacting, adopting and agreeing to be bound by this Compact shall be deemed and regarded as “substantively identical” with respect to such other legislation enacted by another State notwithstanding: (a) any difference in section 2 of Article IV with specific regard to the respectively enacting State’s own method of appointing its member to the Commission; (b) any difference in section 5 of Article IV with specific regard to the respectively enacting State’s own obligation to fund the Commission; (c) any difference in section 1 and 2 of Article VI with specific regard to the number and identity of each delegate respectively appointed on behalf of the enacting State, provided that no more than three delegates may attend and participate in the Convention on behalf of any State; or (d) any difference in section 7 of Article X with specific regard to the respectively enacting State as to whether section 1 of Article V of this Compact shall survive termination of this Compact, and thereafter become a continuing resolution of the Legislature of such State applying to Congress for the calling of a convention of the states under Article V of the Constitution of the United States, under such terms and limitations as may be specified by such State.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 4. When fewer than three-fourths of the States are Member States, any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting appropriate legislation, as determined by state law, and giving notice of such withdrawal to the Compact Administrator, if any, or otherwise to the chief executive officer of each other Member State. A withdrawal shall not affect the validity or applicability of the compact with respect to remaining Member States, provided that there remain at least two such States. However, once at least three-fourths of the States are Member States, then no Member State may withdraw from the Compact prior to its termination absent unanimous consent of all Member States.

However, whenever any Member State enacts appropriate legislation, as determined by the laws of the respective state, withdrawing from this Compact, the Compact Administrator shall immediately send certified conforming copies of the chaptered version of such withdrawal legislation as maintained in the statutes of each such withdrawing Member State, solely to each chief executive officer of each remaining Member State, giving notice of such withdrawal.

      </p>
      <p>
       Section 3. Delegate Identity and Procedure. States shall be represented at the Convention through duly appointed delegates. The number, identity and authority of delegates assigned to each State shall be determined by this Compact in the case of Member States or, in the case of States that are not Member States, by their respective state laws. However, to prevent disruption of proceedings, no more than three delegates may attend and participate in the Convention on behalf of any State. A certified chaptered conforming copy of this Compact, together with government-issued photographic proof of identification, shall suffice as credentials for delegates of Member States.

      </p>
      <p>
       Section 7. Emergency Suspension and Relocation of the Convention. In the event that the Chair of the Convention declares an emergency due to disorder or an imminent threat to public health and safety prior to the completion of the business on the Agenda, and a majority of the States present at the Convention do not object to such declaration, further Convention proceedings shall be temporarily suspended, and the Commission shall subsequently relocate or reschedule the Convention to resume proceedings in an orderly fashion in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Compact with prior notice given to the Compact Notice Recipients.

       Section 1. To the extent that the effectiveness of this Compact or any of its Articles or provisions requires the alteration of local legislative rules, drafting policies, or procedure to be effective, the enactment of legislation enacting, adopting and agreeing to be bound by this Compact shall be deemed to waive, repeal, supersede, or otherwise amend and conform all such rules, policies or procedures to allow for the effectiveness of this Compact to the fullest extent permitted by the constitution of any affected Member State.

       Section 3. In addition to all other powers and duties conferred by state law which are consistent with the terms and conditions of this Compact, the chief law enforcement officer of each Member State is empowered to defend the Compact from any legal challenge, as well as to seek civil mandatory and prohibitory injunctive relief to enforce this Compact; and shall take such action whenever the Compact is challenged or violated.

       Section 4. The exclusive venue for all actions in any way arising under this Compact shall be in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas or the courts of the State of Texas within the jurisdictional boundaries of the foregoing district court. Each Member State shall submit to the jurisdiction of said courts with respect to such actions. However, upon written request by the chief law enforcement officer of any Member State, the Commission may elect to waive this provision for the purpose of ensuring an action proceeds in the venue that allows for the most convenient and effective enforcement or defense of this Compact. Any such waiver shall be limited to the particular action to which it is applied and not construed or relied upon as a general waiver of this provision. The waiver decisions of the Commission under this provision shall be final and binding on each Member State.

       Section 6. Article VIII of this Compact is hereby deemed non-severable prior to termination of the Compact. However, if any other phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact, or the applicability of any other phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact to any government, agency, person or circumstance, is declared in a final judgment to be contrary to the Constitution of the United States, contrary to the state constitution of any Member State, or is otherwise held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such phrase, clause, sentence or provision shall be severed and held for naught, and the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability of the remainder of this Compact to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected. Furthermore, if this Compact is declared in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to be entirely contrary to the state constitution of any Member State or otherwise entirely invalid as to any Member State, such Member State shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the Compact, and the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to any remaining Member State. Finally, if this Compact is declared in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to be wholly or substantially in violation of Article I, Section 10, of the Constitution of the United States, then it shall be construed and enforced solely as reciprocal legislation enacted by the affected Member State(s).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 7. Termination. This Compact shall terminate and be held for naught when the Compact is fully performed and the Constitution of the United States is amended by the Balanced Budget Amendment. However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Compact, in the event such amendment does not occur within seven (7) years after the first State passes legislation enacting, adopting and agreeing to be bound to this Compact, the Compact shall terminate as follows: (a) the Commission shall dissolve and wind up its operations within ninety (90) days thereafter, with the Compact Administrator giving notice of such dissolution and the operative effect of this section to the Compact Notice Recipients; and (b) upon the completed dissolution of the Commission, this Compact shall be deemed terminated, repealed, void ab initio, and held for naught.
