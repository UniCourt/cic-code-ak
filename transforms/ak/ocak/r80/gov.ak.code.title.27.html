        It is the policy of the government to encourage the development of mining property, and the mining laws are to be liberally construed for the benefit of a bona fide locator. Rickert v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Before the person seeking to hold a mining claim can obtain a legal title therein, after a discovery of precious metals has been made thereon, he must segregate the ground he seeks to claim from the remainder of the public mineral land, and this is done by what is commonly called a “location.” Moore v. Steelsmith, 1 Alaska 121 (D. Alaska 1901).

       <p>
        <b>
         Mining claims on public lands are “property” in fullest sense of word,
        </b>
        which may be sold, transferred, mortgaged, and inherited without infringing the title of the United States. Copper River Mining Co. v. McClellan, 2 Alaska 134 (D.

Elliott, 3 Alaska 352 (D. Alaska 1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a miner has made a discovery of gold on his claim, has marked its boundaries so that they can be readily traced, and recorded the notice of location, all prior to the attaching of intervening rights, he has acquired a fixed property right and a title thereto good and complete against all the world, though the paramount title and fee thereof is in his trustee, the United States. Windmuller v. Clarkson, 2 Alaska 298 (D. Alaska 1904).

       </p>
       <p>
        A mining claim is a possessory title, and probably something more; it is legal in its character; it is property in the highest sense; it may be sold and inherited; the miner may enjoy his possession; he may claim all lodes whose apices lie within the surface lines of his location; he may mine and extract, and appropriate to his own use, all minerals therein to whatever depth; and his estate, whatever it may be, comes as a grant from the United States, the owner of the soil, under the acts of Congress. Tyee Consol. Mining Co. v. Langstedt, 1 Alaska 439 (D. Alaska 1902), rev'd, 121 F. 709, 2 Alaska Fed. 53 (9th Cir. Alaska 1903), modified, 136 F. 124, 2 Alaska Fed. 358 (9th Cir. Alaska 1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to dig and appropriate the ores in a mining claim is an exclusive right which passes to one’s heirs and assigns. Tyee Consol. Mining Co. v. Langstedt, 1 Alaska 439 (D. Alaska 1902), rev'd, 121 F. 709, 2 Alaska Fed. 53 (9th Cir. Alaska 1903), modified, 136 F. 124, 2 Alaska Fed. 358 (9th Cir. Alaska 1905).

         Meaning of “vein,” “lode” or “ledge.” —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        A vein, lode or ledge, terms used synonymously, means a body of mineral or mineral-bearing rock within defined boundaries in the general mass of a mountain. Myers v. Lloyd, 4 Alaska 263 (D. Alaska 1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        To constitute a vein, lode, or ledge, it is not necessary that it be hard or quartz rock, but any combination of rock, though broken and mixed up with mineral and other things, is sufficient, if in place.
        It must, however, be mineral-bearing rock, though not necessarily ore or mineral. Myers v. Lloyd, 4 Alaska 263 (D. Alaska 1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whenever two conditions are found together — that is, (1) quartz or rock held in place by the adjacent country rock, and (2) the presence therein of gold, silver, cinnabar, lead, tin, copper, or other valuable deposits — there is a lode. Meydenbauer v. Stevens, 78 F. 787, 1 Alaska Fed. 499 (D. Alaska 1897).

        <b>
         Meaning of “rock in place.” —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        “Rock in place” means the body of the country in a particular locality, which has not been affected by the action of the elements, and which may be said to remain in its natural, original state and condition, as distinguished from the superficial mass lying above it; that is, “rock in place” is solid, fixed rock, as distinguished from surface slide, debris, alluvial, or wash.
        Yet rock in place does not necessarily mean solid rock, in the sense that it should be free from breaks, seams, or gashes.
        It rather means the solid substance of which the particular mountain or locality is constituted, the substance forming the mountain. Myers v. Lloyd, 4 Alaska 263 (D. Alaska 1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        The quartz or rock designated as “in place” must be suspended between, or lie within, or be enclosed by walls of rock constituting the general mass of the earth’s crust in the immediate vicinity of the zone or belt. Meydenbauer v. Stevens, 78 F. 787, 1 Alaska Fed. 499 (D. Alaska 1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether the vein, lode, or ledge is in place depends upon its position in the crust of the earth; that is, whether the vein, lode, or ledge is enclosed by a mass of country rock comprising the mountain, more than upon the character of the ore itself. Myers v. Lloyd, 4 Alaska 263 (D. Alaska 1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        By use of the phrase “in place” it was evidently intended to make a distinction between rock or quartz held in place by the adjoining country rock and bunches or blotches of quartz or rock simply lying or resting upon the earth’s surface without any walls, and also pieces or boulders detached from the earth’s crust, commonly called “float,” and usually found in the mountain gulches and along the beds of streams in a mineral country. Meydenbauer v. Stevens, 78 F. 787, 1 Alaska Fed. 499 (D. Alaska 1897).

       <p>
        The principle which must guide the court in determining what constitutes a valid quartz location, so far as concerns the discovery of a vein, lode, or ledge in place containing gold-bearing rock or other mineralized rock, must be governed, to no small extent, if not entirely, by what the prospectors and miners of this mining camp consider and know as “rock in place.” Myers v.

        Definition of “grubstake contract.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A grubstake contract is an agreement between two or more persons to thereafter locate mines upon the public domain by their joint aid, effort, labor, or expense, whereby each is to acquire, by virtue of the act of location, such an interest in the mine as is agreed on in the contract. Cascaden v. Dunbar, 2 Alaska 408 (D. Alaska 1905); Marks v. Gates, 2 Alaska 519 (D. Alaska 1905), aff'd, 154 F. 481, 2 Alaska Fed. 788 (9th Cir. Alaska 1907).

        Under general law of grubstakes agreement must be definite.

        Grubstake contract need not state interest of each party. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not essential to the validity of a grubstake contract that it should specifically state the interest of each party thereto. Tuppela v. Chicagoff Mining Co., 267 F. 753, 4 Alaska Fed. 931 (9th Cir. Alaska), cert. denied, 254 U.S. 648, 41 S. Ct. 61, 65 L. Ed. 456 (U.S. 1920).

      <p>
       Each party to the grubstake contract not named in the location notice becomes, nevertheless, an equitable owner and tenant in common with those named. Cascaden v. Dunbar, 2 Alaska 408 (D. Alaska 1905); Marks v. Gates, 2 Alaska 519 (D. Alaska 1905), aff'd, 154 F. 481, 2 Alaska Fed. 788 (9th Cir. Alaska 1907).

      </p>
      <p>
       Parties claiming an interest in property located by a man on an alleged grubstake must prove that at the time the location was made he was working on the grubstake furnished by them, or pursuant to a specific agreement, usually one by the terms of which they were to furnish him a further grubstake if the one originally given was exhausted.

        Agreement held more than “grubstaking contract.” —

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the plaintiff has a half interest in a mining company, and others owned the other half, and where the plaintiff furnished the provisions, tools, and money, and they furnished the labor, and the profits were divided half and half, and when there was a loss, plaintiff bore his part of it, and his partners lost their labor, this is an agreement common to mining partnerships in the West, but it is something more than a “grubstaking” contract.

      <p>
       The purpose of both the notice and the monuments is to identify the claim, and generally this can be done most certainly by the stakes set on the ground by the miner himself. Price v. McIntosh, 1 Alaska 286 (D. Alaska 1901), aff'd, 121 F. 716, 2 Alaska Fed. 38 (9th Cir. Alaska 1903).

      </p>
      <p>
       Mining lode claims are frequently found where there are no permanent monuments or natural objects other than rocks or neighboring hills.

      <p>
       If the center line of a location lengthwise of the claim up and down the creek is marked by a stake or monument at each end thereof, upon one or both of which is placed a written notice showing that the locator claims the length of said line upon the claim from stake to stake and a certain specified number of feet in width on each side of the line, such location of the claim is so marked that the boundaries may be readily traced, and, so far as the marking of the location is concerned, is a sufficient compliance with the law, unless the conditions or topography of the country or the great amount of brush or timber on the land, would prevent a person making an honest and bona fide effort to trace or ascertain the boundaries from doing so. Moore v. Steelsmith, 1 Alaska 121 (D. Alaska 1901).
      </p>
      <p>
       Location by two center stakes, posted or written notices, and by serial number, is a sufficient marking of the location. Loeser v. Gardiner, 1 Alaska 641 (D. Alaska 1902).

        Deficiency in marking may not be supplied by recourse to location certificate. —

      <p>
       Where testimony is insufficient to show that the claims were so distinctly marked as to enable a third person to trace the boundaries by means of cairns or posts erected on the claims above the timber line, or by posts, blazes or other marks on claims below timber line, such a deficiency may not be supplied by recourse to the certificates of location.

      <p>
       When a mining claim is once sufficiently marked out upon the ground, and all other necessary acts of location are performed, it vests the right of possession in the locator, which right cannot be divested by the obliteration of the marks or removal of the stakes without the fault of the locator, so long as he continues to perform the necessary work upon the ground, and to comply with the law in other respects.

       Once a claim has been validly located and properly marked on the ground, the subsequent obliteration of the boundary markings through no fault of the locator does not cause a forfeiture of the claim. Dodge v. Wilkinson, 664 P.2d 157 (Alaska 1983).

      <p>
       While the courts treat with great indulgence inaccuracies and uncertainties in initial notices and markings prescribed for mining locations, the same considerations do not apply to the recorded certificate of location, where, as here, a liberal length of time is given in which to make such record. Vedin v. McConnell, 22 F.2d 753, 5 Alaska Fed. 394 (9th Cir. Alaska 1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       A certificate which failed to disclose the width of the claim, to give a description by reference to numbered stakes or monuments, to state the date of discovery or posting of location notice, or to tie the claim to any permanent monument or natural object, except by the vague and wholly inadequate reference to certain creeks was inadequate.

      <p>
       While 30 USC § 28 merely provides that if records of mining claims are recorded they shall contain “such a description of the claim or claims located by reference to some natural object or permanent monument as will identify the claim,” this section makes such a recording within 90 days after the date of posting the notice of location mandatory. Vevelstad v. Flynn, 230 F.2d 695, 16 Alaska 83 (9th Cir. Alaska), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 827, 77 S. Ct. 40, 1 L. Ed. 2d 49 (U.S. 1956).

        Stakes and monuments prevail over location certificate as to ground located. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a variance or discrepancy between the stakes and monuments on the ground and the recorded location certificate, the former will prevail over the latter, as superior evidence of the particular ground located and its boundaries. Sturtevant v. Vogel, 167 F. 448, 3 Alaska Fed. 249 (9th Cir. Alaska 1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is any clerical error as to the courses or distances, the rule is that such discrepancies are to be controlled by the monuments erected upon the ground, or references to other well-known objects or locations. Walton v. Wild Goose Mining &amp; Trading Co., 123 F. 209, 2 Alaska Fed. 110 (9th Cir. Alaska 1903), cert. denied, 194 U.S. 631, 24 S. Ct. 856, 48 L. Ed. 1158 (U.S. 1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       The description of the location as appears from the record is binding on the locator with this exception: If the calls as to distances and courses set out in the description vary from the markings actually made on the ground, the latter are to prevail, as it is the markings on the ground which establish the boundaries of the claim in contemplation of the statute.

        Regulations governing annual labor are not interference with federal law. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Regulations governing increased amount of work required to hold possession of mining claims, certain amount of discovery work done within a limited period, and like regulations, have been held to be reasonable and valid and not an interference with the federal law. Umphrey v. Betsch, 6 Alaska 211 (D. Alaska 1919).

       <b>
        Labor must improve claim and facilitate extraction of contents. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The test as to what will satisfy the statutory requirement of annual labor is as to whether it is such as will in fact amount to an improvement of the claim, such as is calculated to develop it and facilitate the extraction of the valuable contents of the claim. Debney v. Iles, 3 Alaska 438 (D. Alaska 1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       The miner is to be given the benefit of his expenditures or labors so long as they are made in good faith and for the promotion of the extraction of mineral and the development of the claim. Bakke v. Latimer, 3 Alaska 95 (D. Alaska 1906).

       <b>
        Annual labor may be done outside of the claim or group of claims.

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Proof may be offered to show that work outside of claim or group of claims was done for purpose of developing claims,
       </b>
       and the fact that it tends to develop them, and, when shown, it complies with all requirements. Rickard v. Thompson, 72 F.2d 807, 5 Alaska Fed. 740 (9th Cir. Alaska 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Work done outside of a claim, or a group of claims, if done for the purpose of prospecting or developing the claim, as in the case of tunnels, drifts, etc., is as available for holding the claim as if done within the boundaries of the claim. Bakke v. Latimer, 3 Alaska 95 (D. Alaska 1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       A drain two miles away from a placer claim begun under a definite plan for its extension through a series of claims might, when completed, be of great benefit and value to each, and, in such a case, work done at a distance from any one of the claims might be reckoned as assessment work thereon, since it would tend to its benefit or improvement. Anvil Hydraulic &amp; Drainage Co. v. Code, 182 F. 205, 3 Alaska Fed. 515 (9th Cir. Alaska 1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where several claims are held in common, the annual assessment work for all may be done upon one of the claims or upon adjacent patented land or even upon public land provided that the claims are contiguous, the work is for the benefit of all of them, and the work tends to develop them all and to facilitate the extraction of ore therefrom. Anvil Hydraulic &amp; Drainage Co. v. Code, 182 F. 205, 3 Alaska Fed. 515 (9th Cir. Alaska 1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       Assessment work may be done for the benefit of a claim either on other claims or upon public land, provided it is actually done for the benefit of such claim and such work is in fact beneficial to the claim. Rickert v. Thompson, 8 Alaska 398 (D. Alaska 1933), aff'd, Rickard v. Thompson, 72 F.2d 807, 5 Alaska Fed. 740 (9th Cir. Alaska 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where water is brought to such a point on or above the claim that such water can be used in mining the claim, it is not necessary that the water should actually be so used in order that the work inure to the benefit of the claim. Rickert v. Thompson, 8 Alaska 398 (D. Alaska 1933), aff'd, Rickard v. Thompson, 72 F.2d 807, 5 Alaska Fed. 740 (9th Cir. Alaska 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       One general system may be formed, well adapted and entered into, to work several contiguous claims or lodes, and, when such is the case, work in furtherance of the system whether done within or without the claim or claims is work on the claims intended to be developed. Rickert v. Thompson, 8 Alaska 398 (D. Alaska 1933), aff'd, Rickard v. Thompson, 72 F.2d 807, 5 Alaska Fed. 740 (9th Cir. Alaska 1934).

        Claim need not be more valuable after performance of labor. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The law does not require that the labor performed shall benefit a claim in the sense of making the claim more valuable after the performance of the labor than before. Walton v. Wild Goose Mining &amp; Trading Co., 123 F. 209, 2 Alaska Fed. 110 (9th Cir. Alaska 1903), cert. denied, 194 U.S. 631, 24 S. Ct. 856, 48 L. Ed. 1158 (U.S. 1904).

       <b>
        Work may be performed by one with legal or equitable interest in claim. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be sufficient to preserve the claim if the work was performed by anyone who had a legal or equitable interest or title therein. Rickard v. Thompson, 72 F.2d 807, 5 Alaska Fed. 740 (9th Cir. Alaska 1934).
      </p>

       <b>
        And authorized agent or legal representative may perform labor. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       While the labor or improvement required by the statute ordinarily must be performed or made by the owner of the claim, this can be done by the owner’s authorized agent or legal representative. Rickard v. Thompson, 72 F.2d 807, 5 Alaska Fed. 740 (9th Cir. Alaska 1934).

       <b>
        Grouping of noncontiguous claims. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether noncontiguous claims may be grouped depends upon the circumstances of each case, the nature of the work, the character of the ground grouped, the plan for common development, the ownership of the intervening ground, and the existence of an arrangement for right of way across such ground. The true tests are: can the work be made applicable to all the ground, and does it tend to the development of the group, and was it made in good faith for that purpose? Rickert v. Thompson, 8 Alaska 398 (D. Alaska 1933), aff'd, Rickard v. Thompson, 72 F.2d 807, 5 Alaska Fed. 740 (9th Cir. Alaska 1934).

        Provisional location depending on prior locator’s nonperformance of annual labor cannot be made. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An entry upon a mining claim before a prior locator is in default cannot be made for the purpose of making a provisional location, to be valid or worthless according as the prior locator fails or not to do the annual work. Rooney v. Barnette, 200 F. 700, 3 Alaska Fed. 884 (9th Cir. Alaska 1912).

       <b>
        Failure to perform followed by subsequent performance. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though the original locator failed to perform the assessment work for a certain year, and yet in the ensuing year does perform the work required for that year, before the rights of another intervene, his right is deemed to have been revived. Debney v. Iles, 3 Alaska 438 (D. Alaska 1907).

       <b>
        Resumption of work after forfeiture. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Rights of the locator and owner of an abandoned or forfeited claim revert back to the United States at the moment of abandonment or forfeiture, and the claims become public lands subject to be relocated. Dufresne v. Northern Light Mining Co., 2 Alaska 592 (D. Alaska 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Trustees cannot legally forfeit to themselves the interest of their beneficiaries.
       </b>
       They are bound to the exercise of the utmost good faith, and the burden is on them to show such good faith. Donohoe v. Tjosevig, 6 Alaska 139 (D. Alaska 1919).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Abandonment. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a locator seeks to establish a relocation upon a claim which he asserts to have been abandoned, he should be held to a strict compliance with the requirements of the statute. Debney v. Iles, 3 Alaska 438 (D. Alaska 1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Good faith of locator. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In cases where it has been sought to establish a relocation of a mining claim, the bona fides of the prior locator must be taken into consideration in determining whether he had done the necessary assessment work to retain his claim.
       The courts are reluctant to enforce a forfeiture and will not do so, except upon clear and convincing proof of the failure of the former owner to perform the amount of labor required by law. McKay v. Neussler, 148 F. 86, 2 Alaska Fed. 620 (9th Cir. Alaska 1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Burden of proof. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proving that assessment work benefited claims, or that the work was reasonably calculated to lead to the extraction of ore, is upon the one making the claim. Flynn v. Vevelstad, 119 F. Supp. 93, 14 Alaska 557 (D. Alaska 1954), aff'd, 230 F.2d 695, 16 Alaska 83 (9th Cir. Alaska 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the disinclination of the courts to impose the penalty of forfeiture, the person claiming the benefit of assessment work is required to establish that which he asserts.
       Debney v. Iles, 3 Alaska 438 (D. Alaska 1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       Courts are reluctant to enforce the penalty of forfeiture and have established the doctrine that forfeiture cannot be established, except upon clear and convincing proof of the failure of the former owner to have work performed or improvements made to the amount required by law. Debney v. Iles, 3 Alaska 438 (D. Alaska 1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       In all cases involving the trial of title to land — adverse proceedings not being an exception — the rule obtains that the party who relies on a forfeiture must plead it, and then affirmatively support it by proof. Anderson v. Anvil Hydraulic Co., 3 Alaska 496 (D. Alaska 1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       When work is done outside the boundaries of a claim, the burden is upon the owner to show that he intended such work to benefit the claim and that, in fact, it did benefit it. Rickert v. Thompson, 8 Alaska 398 (D. Alaska 1933), aff'd, Rickard v. Thompson, 72 F.2d 807, 5 Alaska Fed. 740 (9th Cir. Alaska 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       A forfeiture must be set up before it can be insisted upon, and where the defendant attempted to do so and meagerly and imperfectly stated his defense, the result was an imperfect statement of a good defense, but such a statement is sufficient to support the verdict and judgment. Cache Creek Mining Co. v. Brahenberg, 217 F. 240, 4 Alaska Fed. 252 (9th Cir. Alaska 1914).

       The bona fides of the attempt of an owner to comply with the law in order to obtain a forfeiture of his co-owner’s interest has no part in the questions to be considered by the jury in aid of the proof that he did the requisite assessment work or otherwise.

       Notice, published in compliance with the law, directed to part owners of a mining claim, notifying them that if they failed within 90 days after the date of the last publication of the notice to contribute their proportion as co-owners, their interests in the claim would be forfeited was, so far as the time for contribution is concerned, a waiver of a prior personal notice and operated to extend the time for making the payments to prevent forfeiture.

      <p>
       The department of natural resources (DNR) may not ignore cumulative effects of mining and related support facilities by unreasonably restricting its jurisdiction or by permitting facilities within a larger mining area separately, but must review any permit application under this chapter considering the probable cumulative impact of all anticipated activities which will be a part of a “surface coal mining operation,” whether or not the activities are part of the permit under review. If DNR determines that the cumulative impact is problematic, the problems must be resolved before the initial permit is approved. Trustees ex rel Alaska v. Gorsuch, 835 P.2d 1239 (Alaska 1992).

       Permits will be issued for a term of five years.  However, the commissioner may grant a permit for a longer term if the application is complete for that longer term and the applicant demonstrates that the longer term is necessary to allow the applicant to obtain financing for equipment or for the opening of the operation.

       A permit terminates if a permittee does not begin surface coal mining operations under the permit within three years after the permit is issued.  The commissioner may grant reasonable extensions of time if the permittee shows that the extensions are necessary (1) because of litigation that precludes the commencement of the operation or threatens substantial economic loss to the permittee; or (2) for reasons beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the permittee. With respect to coal to be mined for use in a synthetic fuel facility or specific major electric generating facility, the permittee is considered to have begun surface mining operations at the time that the construction of the synthetic fuel or generating facility is begun.

      The definition of “surface coal mining operations” in this section, and the regulations implementing this chapter, should be amended to apply to such operations which include the leaching or other chemical or physical processing of coal wherever that leaching or processing occurs, not just “on-site” activities. This will conform the state law to similar federal regulations. June 11, 1986, Op. Att’y Gen.

       A bonus will be paid only once for production of ores or concentrates from a single lode or placer deposit. The commissioner or a duly authorized representative shall determine whether production from a given location, claim, or group of claims is the first production from the deposit for the purpose of this chapter or whether the deposit has previously been discovered or worked for any of the minerals presently eligible for assistance under the Federal Office of Mineral Exploration program or any other metals or minerals, including gravel, not so listed, or whether production is such as to which a bonus has already been paid, or whether for any reason a bonus is not payable. In making the determination, the commissioner shall be guided by the federal or state mining laws, either of which is applicable, or both.
