         Factors in determining nonresident contacts. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The following approach is used in evaluating the contacts a nonresident defendant has with the forum: (1) The nonresident defendant must do some act or consummate some transaction with the forum or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws; (2) the claim must be one which arises out of or results from the defendant’s forum-related activities; and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable.

         Extent of purposeful submission to laws of forum state. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        It is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.
        The extent of purposeful submission to the laws of the forum state necessary to satisfy this requirement, however, depends upon the nature of the activity giving rise to the suit. Whether due process is satisfied must depend upon the quality and nature of the activity in relation to the fair and orderly administration of the laws which it was the purpose of the due process clause to insure. Jones Enterprises, Inc. v. Atlas Service Corp., 442 F.2d 1136 (9th Cir. Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The smaller the element of purposeful interjection by the defendant into the forum, the less is jurisdiction to be anticipated and the less reasonable is its exercise. Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Marina Salina Cruz, 649 F.2d 1266 (9th Cir. Alaska 1981).

         Broad long-arm statute. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Alaska’s long-arm statute is a broad one, which is regarded as an attempt by the legislature to establish jurisdiction to the maximum extent permitted by due process. Jonz v. Garrett/Airesearch Corp., 490 P.2d 1197 (Alaska 1971); Packard v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 366 F. Supp. 966 (D. Alaska 1973); Fairbanks Air Service, Inc. v. Air Operations International Corp., 378 F. Supp. 1405 (D. Alaska 1974); Modern Trailer Sales v. Traweek, 561 P.2d 1192 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The law of Alaska antedating this section subjected foreign corporations to Alaska process to “the outer limits of the due process clause of the federal constitution.”
        This section cannot be broader than that, and it is not seriously contended that this section is narrower. Jones Enterprises, Inc. v. Atlas Service Corp., 442 F.2d 1136 (9th Cir. Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Alaska long-arm statute is an assertion of jurisdiction to the maximum extent permitted by due process. Morrow v. New Moon Homes, 548 P.2d 279 (Alaska 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court has construed this section to extend Alaska’s jurisdiction to the maximum reach consistent with the guarantees of due process under the 14th amendment. Volkswagenwerk, A. G. v. Klippan, GmbH, 611 P.2d 498 (Alaska), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 974, 101 S. Ct. 385, 66 L. Ed. 2d 236 (U.S. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since this section has been construed by the Alaska supreme court to establish jurisdiction to the maximum extent permitted by due process, federal court needs only consider whether asserting jurisdiction over the defendant would violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.

        If the nonresident defendant’s activities within a state are neither substantial nor continuous and systematic, the existence of jurisdiction depends on the nature and quality of those of the defendant’s contacts that are related to the cause of action.

       <p>
        This section simply requires six consecutive months of Alaska residency while in a marital relationship; it does not require that the married couple share a home, let alone that they spend every day together for the required six months. Therefore, a superior court had personal jurisdiction over a husband who had resided in Alaska for six consecutive months during his marital relationship with the wife; the husband testified that he resided in Alaska more or less continuously for the first eight months of the marriage, the husband obtained an Alaska driver’s license, he identified Alaska as his residence for federal tax purposes, and he bought a condominium in Alaska.

        A manufacturer who has placed his product, directly or through normal channels of trade, in a forum state, knowing that defective design or workmanship in his product will create a substantial risk of injury in that state, can, consistent with due process, be called upon to defend his product there. Jones Enterprises, Inc. v. Atlas Service Corp., 442 F.2d 1136 (9th Cir. Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the activities complained of create a substantial risk of injury in the forum state, direct contact with that state is not essential.
        It is sufficient that the defendant purposefully sets his product or his designs into the stream of commerce, knowing, or having a reason to know, that they will reach the forum state and that they create a potential risk of injury. Jones Enterprises, Inc. v. Atlas Service Corp., 442 F.2d 1136 (9th Cir. Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a manufacturer voluntarily places its product in the general stream of commerce without restriction, the “minimum contact” requirement is satisfied in all forums where it is foreseeable to the manufacturer that the product may be marketed.

        The stream of commerce theory applies where the party attempting to assert jurisdiction is a nonresident corporation bringing an indemnity or contribution action separate from the original products liability lawsuit.

        The stream of commerce doctrine applied to the manufacturer of a component part of a product which is widely distributed by another entity where the component manufacturer deliberately designs its product in anticipation of it being widely marketed in American jurisdictions, and sells the component directly to several major auto producers with the knowledge that the component will be incorporated into their products and sold throughout America. Volkswagenwerk, A. G. v. Klippan, GmbH, 611 P.2d 498 (Alaska), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 974, 101 S. Ct. 385, 66 L. Ed. 2d 236 (U.S. 1980).

        Manufacturer and supplier of a seat belt had sufficient minimum contacts with the state, by deliberately placing their seat belt restraint system in the general stream of commerce, to meet due process standards for personal jurisdiction where the manufacturer and supplier had sold millions of seat belt assemblies for incorporation into automobiles it knew were destined for purchase by consumers throughout the United States. Alaska law required installation of lap belts in all automobiles sold in this state during 1967, the model year of the claimants’ car, and the manufacturer and supplier represented by a label sewn on the belt involved in the claimants’ accident that its restraint systems were “approved for sale in all states,” and took steps to insure that the belts complied with standards established by the American Society of Automotive Engineers.

       The operation of a motor vehicle by a nonresident, or owned by a nonresident and operated by the express or implied consent of the owner, in the state is considered equivalent to an appointment of the commissioner of administration by the nonresident as the nonresident’s attorney. The summons may be served on the commissioner in an action against the nonresident growing out of an accident or collision in which the vehicle is involved while being so operated. This operation is considered a signification of the nonresident’s agreement that a summons against the nonresident which is so served has the same legal force as if served on the nonresident personally in the state.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c05s09.05.020ol1b">

        Effect of use of highways by nonresident. —

      <p>
       This section provides that the use of Alaska’s highways by a nonresident motorist is the legal equivalent of the appointment by the motorist of the Alaska commissioner of revenue as the motorist’s attorney upon whom process may be served in an action against the motorist arising out of an automobile accident in Alaska.

        Construction. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that many courts in states having statutes of the same general type as this section have strictly construed those statutes does not impose upon the courts of Alaska an obligation to strictly construe its statute.
       The state of Alaska is new, and it might well conclude that the result of the strict construction given to such statutes in other states has been to frustrate to a considerable degree the purposes of their statutes by making it relatively easy for nonresident motorists to find a flaw in the service or in some other step in the statutory procedure. Allen v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 342 F.2d 951 (9th Cir. Alaska 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       If and when, in an appeal to the supreme court of Alaska, that court is confronted with the problem of whether the Alaska nonresident motorist statute should be strictly construed because it is in derogation of the common law, or should be liberally construed because it is a remedial statute, or should be construed without any particular predilection as statutes are normally construed, Alaska superior courts will then be obliged to follow the precedent so made at the risk of being reversed if they do not.
       But even then, if an Alaskan superior court fails to follow the precedent, and there is no appeal, it will not be for some other court in some other lawsuit to hold that the judgment is void for want of jurisdiction. Allen v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 342 F.2d 951 (9th Cir. Alaska 1965).

       It would be an unduly narrow construction of a service statute such as this one to hold that one could permanently evade service by the easy expedient of not accepting mail, or not permitting mail to be forwarded, for the brief period of ten days.

        Effect of failure to serve amended complaint on commissioner. —

      <p>
       Since the court’s judgment for plaintiff was well below the figures given in either the original or the amended complaint, the omission to serve the amended complaint on the commissioner of revenue was a technical omission of no substance, and which cannot be collaterally litigated.

        From the standpoint of the true owner, the purpose of the various requirements of adverse possession — that the nonpermissive use be actual, open, notorious, continuous, exclusive and hostile — is to put him on notice of the hostile nature of the possession so that he, the owner, may take steps to vindicate his rights by legal action.

       <p>
        One of the requirements for acquisition of title by adverse possession is that the possession must be continuous for the statutory period in order to prevent the original owner’s possession from constructively attaching to the land, thus starting the statute running anew, because the owner must be out of possession for 10 years in order for the statute to be a bar to an action to recover the land. Ringstad v. Grannis, 171 F.2d 170, 12 Alaska 190 (9th Cir. Alaska 1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        A showing that use was openly adverse to the owner’s interest must be for the full statutory period of ten years.
        If during that period it is established that the adverse claimant has done something to recognize the owner’s title, the continuity of the adverse possession period is interrupted and the ten-year period of limitation does not begin to run again in the adverse claimant’s favor until he repudiates the owner’s title.

       <p>
        When one enters into possession or use of another’s property, there is a presumption that he does so with the owner’s permission and in subordination to his title. Hamerly v. Denton, 359 P.2d 121 (Alaska 1961); Ayers v. Day &amp; Night Fuel Co., 451 P.2d 579 (Alaska 1969); Peters v. Juneau-Douglas Girl Scout Council, 519 P.2d 826 (Alaska 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        This presumption that one who enters into possession or use of another’s property does so with the owner’s permission is rebutted by the adverse claimant’s showing that he was not on the property by permission and establishing that the record title holder could have ejected him from possession throughout the statutory period.

       <p>
        The presumption that one who enters into possession or use of another’s property does so with the owner’s permission is overcome only by showing that such use of another’s land was not only continuous and uninterrupted, but was openly adverse to the owner’s interest, i.e., by proof of a distinct and positive assertion of a right hostile to the owner of the property.

        A public way may be created by public use of private property for the 10-year prescriptive period. There is a presumption that the use of land by an alleged easement holding was permissive. The state can overcome the presumption of permissive use by showing that such use of another’s land was not only continuous and uninterrupted, but was openly adverse to the owner’s interest, i.e., by proof of a distinct and positive assertion of a right hostile to the owner of the property.

       </p>
       <p>
        The presumption that use of land by an alleged easement holder was permissive does not arise if the roadway in question was not established by the owner of the servient estate for its own use, but was for many years the only means of passage to the dominant estate.

        Negating permissive use involves the concepts of openness and adversity. The openness requirement embodies the principle that a landowner is responsible for knowing the physical encumbrances on and the boundaries of the owner’s land. This responsibility includes any changes in existing uses on the land. In the present case, the state need only show that its continued use of Bay Road over the new route was open, and not that the change, if any, from the old road to the new route was open and obvious to the private landowner.

        His beliefs as to the true legal ownership of the land, his good faith or bad faith in entering into possession (i.e., whether he claimed a legal right to enter, or avowed himself a wrongdoer), are irrelevant. Peters v. Juneau-Douglas Girl Scout Council, 519 P.2d 826 (Alaska 1974).

        Partial summary judgment should not have been given to a member of an LLC, and a finding that the statute of limitations barred a second member's counterclaims was error, because the second member's counterclaims were compulsory, being “logically related,” and automatically related back to the first member's 2013 cross-claims. The first member's pleadings related back to his 2007 original cross-complaint since they focused on the transactions or occurrences that caused the LLC's losses, and the relation back to the 2007 cross-complaint allowed the second member to “escape the bar of the statutes of limitations.” Baker v.

        The statute of limitations begins to run in contract causes of action from the time the right of action accrues.

        Dismissal of the insured’s malpractice lawsuit against the insurance broker was proper because the insurer’s letter put the insured on inquiry notice that he might have a claim against the insurance broker and thus the statute of limitations had begun to run more than three years before the insured sued the insured broker. The insured knew that he was personally incurring defense costs and knew that it was because the insurer on the general liability policy obtained by the insurance broker was not defending him.

       Since the statute of repose bars an apportionment claim seeking to apportion fault for personal injury, death, or property damage at the same time it would bar the underlying claim, and the last act alleged to have caused appellant's personal injury occurred more than 10 years earlier, his apportionment claim against the Office of Children's Services was barred by the ten-year statute of repose unless it fell within one of the statute's exceptions and remand was necessary because issues of fact regarding those exceptions existed.

       When a claimant alleged that the Alaska Office of Children's Services negligently allowed the claimant to suffer years of sexual abuse while in foster care and after adoption, the trial court should have determined whether the statute of repose applied to the claimant's case before it considered the claimant's as-applied constitutional challenge to the statute of repose.

       Claims of assault and battery, sexual assault, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and false imprisonment based on incidents that allegedly occurred in the 1970s were barred by the two-year tort statute of limitations because expert testimony was required to support a claim based on repressed memory syndrome. Statutes of limitation relating to sexual abuse were enacted after the events at issue, and they did not apply retroactively. Maness v. Gordon, 325 P.3d 522 (Alaska 2014).

       <p>
        The goal of the statute of limitations and the substituted service procedure is to provide speedy adjudication of claims. Byrne v. Ogle, 488 P.2d 716 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of statutes of limitations is to encourage promptness in the prosecution of actions and thus avoid the injustice which may result from the prosecution of stale claims. Byrne v. Ogle, 488 P.2d 716 (Alaska 1971); McCracken v. Davis, 560 P.2d 771 (Alaska 1977); Johnson v. City of Fairbanks, 583 P.2d 181 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutes of limitations attempt to protect against the difficulties caused by lost evidence, faded memories, and disappearing witnesses. McCracken v. Davis, 560 P.2d 771 (Alaska 1977).

        While an action for wrongful death is statutory, there is no legislative intent to treat it differently from common law tort actions. Thus, where the disability of a minor tolls the running of the statute of limitations in tort actions, the disability tolls the running of the 2-year time limit for commencing a wrongful death action.

        Alleged acts of interference with contract rights were one-time occurrences, even though they might have continuing consequences; in determining the time from which the period of limitations is measured, such acts were not analogous to a continuing trespass or nuisance, where repeated and continued tortious acts are committed.

       </p>

        By its own terms, this section extends to, but not beyond, personal torts unless the action is for an injury to the “rights of another not arising on contract and not specifically provided for otherwise.”
        Thus, for claims that do not involve personal, reputational, or injury to dignity, the right(s) allegedly infringed upon must “not aris[e] on contract.” Lee Houston &amp; Assoc. v. Racine, 806 P.2d 848 (Alaska 1991).

        The uniform limitations period impliedly allows every victim of tortious conduct in Alaska, regardless of where he resides and regardless of whether the alleged tortious conduct was by a governmental unit or not, to commence an action for damages within two years without complying with any other time limit.

        Where husband admitted his wife to a hospital for mental evaluation, dismissal of husband’s action alleging that he suffered emotional distress caused by the medical center’s release of his wife to her daughter was appropriate as the two-year statute of limitations barred the husband’s tort claims. The husband learned that his wife had been released to her daughter when he called the hospital on March 31, 2003 and he failed to file his complaint until March 31, 2006. Clemensen v.

        The statute of limitations for tort actions does not apply to claims for equitable apportionment that are filed in accordance with Civil Rule 14(c). Alaska Gen. Alarm, Inc. v. Grinnell, 1 P.3d 98 (Alaska 2000).

        Takings claim by salmon fishers based on damage to value of entry permits from regulatory changes did not fall under the two-year statute of limitations for taking or injuring personal property in this section because the case involved state action, not private action. Vanek v. State, 193 P.3d 283 (Alaska 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employee sued the United States and the United States filed a third-party complaint for apportionment against architects; summary judgment was granted to the United States and the architects; and the employee then filed a direct action against the architects. The employee’s action was untimely, because the Grinnell standard allowed apportionment claims to be raised in the same action outside the two-year tort statute of limitations, while preserving that two-year limitation for direct actions.

       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court erred in granting partial summary judgment to a member of an LLC and in finding that the statutes of limitation barred a second member's counterclaims because the second member’s counterclaims were compulsory, they were “logically related,” and automatically related back to the first member's 2013 cross-claims, the first member's pleadings related back to his 2007 original cross-complaint since they focused on the transactions or occurrences that caused the LLC’s losses, and the relation back to the 2007 cross-complaint allowed the second member to “escape the bar of the statutes of limitations.”

       </p>
       <p>
        A claim for relief for wrongful interference with the right to preserve a dead body belongs exclusively to the surviving spouse or to the next of kin of the decedent.
        This substantive right is in the surviving spouse or next of kin, whether the claim is analyzed as a tortious invasion of a property right or infliction of emotional harm. Burns v. Anchorage Funeral Chapel, 495 P.2d 70 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is generally the law in this country that the right to possess, preserve, and bury, or otherwise dispose of a dead body belongs to the surviving spouse and, if none such, then to the next of kin in the order of their relation to the decedent; that a violation of that right is a tort; and that damages for mental suffering are recoverable for a willful invasion of the rights relating to dead bodies.

        Trial court's grant of summary judgment to the periodontist in a malpractice action was proper because once the patient was on inquiry notice, he had a duty to investigate all potential causes of action before the statute of limitations expired, including a claim for malpractice based on misdiagnosis or misinformation. The patient did investigate such claims before the statute of limitations expired; he knew of the alleged misdiagnosis and misinformation and had over a year to file within the statute of limitations.

        Statute of limitations for legal malpractice does not begin to run until client discovers, or reasonably should discover, existence of all elements of his cause of action; thus, if client discovers his attorney’s negligence before he suffers consequential damages, the statute of limitations will not begin to run until client suffers actual damages.

        Where plaintiff’s claim based upon defendant’s negligent failure to procure or issue earthquake coverage, and plaintiff’s claim based upon defendant’s negligent misrepresentations, did not ripen until the earthquake loss occurred in March 1964, the statute of limitation did not commence to run until that time, and plaintiff’s action, instituted in February of 1966, was brought within the two-year statutory period. Austin v. Fulton Ins. Co., 444 P.2d 536 (Alaska 1968).

       <p>
        Where plaintiff’s interest was in being protected against earthquake loss, there was no invasion, or infringement upon, or impairment of such interest until there had been a loss by earthquake, because until that event occurred such protection could avail the plaintiff nothing.
        His interest, which is legally protected, was in having such protection when it was needed, at the time of the loss and not before.
        Thus, there must be an injury or harm to plaintiff as a consequence of defendant’s negligence to serve as a basis for recovery of damages before the tort becomes actionable and before the period of limitation commences to run. Austin v. Fulton Ins. Co., 444 P.2d 536 (Alaska 1968).

        To establish equitable estoppel it is generally necessary that the party seeking to assert it show that the other party made some misrepresentation, or false statement, or acted fraudulently, and that he reasonably relied on such acts or representations of the other party, and due to such reliance did not institute suit timely.

        There is authority to the effect that equitable estoppel requires more than inaction or silence by a person who has no obligation to speak or act. Yet there can be circumstances where inaction or silence combined with acts or representations can give rise to an appropriate situation calling for the application of the estoppel doctrine.

       <p>
        While an action for wrongful death is statutory, there is no legislative intent to treat it differently from common law tort actions. Thus, where the disability of a minor tolls the running of the statute of limitations in tort actions, the disability tolls the running of the 2-year time limit for commencing a wrongful death action.

         Test for mental condition tolling statute of limitations. —

       </p>
       <p>
        Courts have interpreted liberally the type of mental condition that will toll a statute of limitations.
        The general test is whether a person could know or understand his legal rights sufficiently well to manage his personal affairs. It does not require a formal finding of incompetency by a court. Adkins v. Nabors Alaska Drilling, 609 P.2d 15 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute of limitations for fire damage claim began running when the insurance investigator sent his letter to the insured explaining the denial of his claim; even with seven months’ tolling for mental incapacity under this section, the insured’s claim was untimely and was barred by the statutes of limitations under both tort and contract law. Kaiser v. Umialik Ins., 108 P.3d 876 (Alaska 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Formal finding of incompetency by a medical expert or a court is not necessary to raise a genuine issue of fact as to mental capacity. Cikan v. Arco Alaska, Inc., 125 P.3d 335 (Alaska 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidentiary threshold necessary to preclude the entry of summary judgment is low, and where mental competency is at issue, prior litigation and representation are not necessarily indicative of mental capacity; awareness of an existing claim may not reflect a person’s ability to assess and pursue it in a rational and effective manner.

      A person may not bring an action for the determination of a right or claim to or interest in real property unless commenced within the limitations provided for actions for the recovery of the possession of real property.
      However, a person may not bring an action to set aside, cancel, annul, or otherwise affect a patent to land issued by this state or the United States, or to compel a person claiming or holding under a patent to convey the land described in the patent or a portion of the land to the plaintiff in the action, or to hold the land in trust for or to the use and benefit of the plaintiff, or on account of any matter, thing, or transaction that was had, done, suffered, or transpired before the date of the patent unless the action is commenced within 10 years from the date of the patent. In an action upon a new promise, fraud, or mistake, the running of the time within which an action may be commenced starts from the making of the new promise or the discovery of the fraud or mistake. This section does not bar an equitable owner in possession of real property from defending possession by means of the equitable title. The right of an equitable owner to defend possession in an action or by complaint for injunction is not barred by lapse of time while an action for the possession of the real property is not barred by the provisions of this chapter.

       In the absence of a controlling statute a foreclosure action is subject to the same period of limitations as the underlying debt. Dworkin v. First Nat'l Bank, 444 P.2d 777 (Alaska 1968).
      </p>

       The portion of Alaska’s Code of Civil Procedure which deals with limitation of actions does not contain any provision which specifically establishes a limitation period governing the foreclosure of either legal or equitable mortgages. Dworkin v. First Nat'l Bank, 444 P.2d 777 (Alaska 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a suit to foreclose a mortgage the six-year period of limitation is controlling and the ten-year period pertaining to actions upon sealed instruments is inapplicable. Dworkin v. First Nat'l Bank, 444 P.2d 777 (Alaska 1968).

       Defendant who has requested an indefinite extension of time in which to answer the complaint, resulting in a dismissal for failure to prosecute, was estopped from relying on the statute of limitations to dismiss the refiled claim where the defendant was aware of the claim against her and benefited from the delay because she was not required to retain an attorney to answer the complaint, and the plaintiff acted in good faith in granting extensions of the time to answer.

       A parent’s right of action under this section includes the right to recover loss of society damages. Without question, the death of one’s own child is the greatest loss a parent may suffer. It is far more than pecuniary; whatever monetary disadvantage a child’s death may present to its parents pales in comparison to the immense mental anguish, grief, and sense of loss that this event would inevitably cause.

        The substitution of a new party is generally effected by motion,

       which should ordinarily be made by the party in interest. Nome &amp; Sinook Co. v. Ames Mercantile Co., 187 F. 928, 3 Alaska Fed. 601 (9th Cir. Alaska 1911).

      <p>
       As a general rule, the substituted party takes up the prosecution or defense at the point where the original party left off, and the pleadings already filed inure to the benefit of the new party. Nome &amp; Sinook Co. v. Ames Mercantile Co., 187 F. 928, 3 Alaska Fed. 601 (9th Cir. Alaska 1911).

        Better practice is to direct substituted party to file supplemental pleading. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The substitution having been allowed, probably the better practice would be for the court to direct the substituted party to file a supplemental complaint, showing the transfer and his right to continue the action, or for such party to obtain leave to file such a complaint; but the mere omission to file such a complaint, unless in disobedience of the court’s order, does not render the cause subject to judgment on the pleadings.
       Nor does it furnish grounds for revoking the order of substitution. Nome &amp; Sinook Co. v. Ames Mercantile Co., 187 F. 928, 3 Alaska Fed. 601 (9th Cir. Alaska 1911).

      <p>
       Rape victim’s claim that the cap on noneconomic damages set forth in this section violated her rights under Alaska Const. art. I, § 1 was subject to minimum scrutiny review where restriction did not limit or block the victim’s right to access the courts and noneconomic damages did not provide for basic needs. C.J. v. Dep't of Corr., 151 P.3d 373 (Alaska 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Cap on noneconomic damages set forth in this section did not violate a rape victim’s equal protection rights where the legislature had apparently concluded that large noneconomic damages awards were susceptible to overestimates of the dollar value of a victim’s noneconomic loss, and the legislature could have reasonably concluded that any alternative method of lowering insurance costs would have been less fair than a cap on noneconomic damages. C.J. v. Dep't of Corr., 151 P.3d 373 (Alaska 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Noneconomic damages cap does not violate the constitutional right to a trial by jury because the cap does not intrude on the jury’s fact-finding function but rather represents a policy decision that is applied after the jury’s determination. The jury must still make a determination of the amount of damages to be awarded, and the cap is applied only in those cases where the jury determines that the damages should be higher than the cap; the law setting a limit on allowable damages does not destroy the jury’s role in awarding damages, but merely limits it.

       Because permanently losing the normal use of a body system necessary for day-to-day life constitutes severe physical impairment, and the former section imposed a $500,000 cap on noneconomic damages unless the victim has suffered “severe physical impairment,” the superior court properly removed this issue from the jury’s consideration.

       In making the threshold determination of whether to submit the question of severe disfigurement to the jury, a trial court must balance the twin objectives of restraint and fairness highlighted by the legislature’s declaration of the purposes of the tort reform act that included the damage cap: Discouraging frivolous litigation without diminishing the protection of innocent Alaskans’ rights to reasonable, but not excessive, compensation for tortious injuries.

       Rape victim’s potential noneconomic damages were not limited to a single cap amount where she was entitled to recover the cap amount for each of the three types of sexual penetrations that formed the basis of the parolee’s three convictions.

        Noneconomic damages cap satisfies equal protection. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislature’s approach of imposing a single statutory cap on noneconomic damages for all claims arising from a single death bears a fair and substantial relationship to the legislature’s legitimate objective of reducing the costs of liability and malpractice insurance premiums; although the amount of noneconomic damages that individual beneficiaries receive may differ depending on the number of other beneficiaries whose claims arise from the same death, the estates themselves are still treated equally.

       In a personal injury suit, an erroneous damages cap instruction did not prejudice defendants where plaintiff did not exploit the error by arguing that the cap should guide the jury in considering appropriate awards, the jury permissibly found four separate incidents of assault, which meant that more than one cap applied, and the jury’s noneconomic award of $1,000,000 was half the total amount allowable under the caps.

        In a retaliatory discharge case, the state was properly awarded a share of punitive damages where, once a verdict was returned, the state’s interest came into existence. It did not matter that the case had been appealed and returned to the superior court for recalculations because no new trial was required. Reust v. Alaska Petroleum Contrs., Inc., 206 P.3d 437 (Alaska), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 970, 130 S. Ct. 461, 175 L. Ed. 2d 308 (U.S. 2009).

        Trial court did not err in awarding punitive damages in a fraudulent conveyance case because the findings showed that heirs, who brought the suit against a purported attorney and his brother, suffered substantial damage; however, the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest on the punitive damages award.

        In an injured child’s covenant settlement agreement case, a court erred by awarding punitive damages where the conduct alleged in the counterclaim was not necessarily outrageous or recklessly indifferent, nor was it so characterized, the allegation that the insurer violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was not sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, and the body of the complaint sought only a judgment for the full amount of the liability the original insureds incurred as a result of the child’s injuries, with no claim for personal wrongs to the original insureds for their treatment by the insurer.

        Where not only was an insurer dilatory in responding to the tenders of defense by the United States, but the reasons articulated by the insurer as the basis for denying coverage and a defense did not provide a reasonable explanation for rejecting the tenders by the U.S., a jury could find that the insurer’s rejection of the tenders by the U.S. was outrageous or done with reckless indifference, which would support an award of punitive damages under subsection (b) of this section.

        Clear and convincing evidence supported an award of punitive damages against a doctor who committed a battery against a fellow employee by grabbing her arm, dragging her down the hall, and throwing her into an office chair, causing her injury; claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress would have prevailed; the doctor’s behavior was egregious, reckless, and outrageous, particularly in view of the disparity in power between the employee and the doctor in the hospital setting.

        Where a neighbor started a large fire to clear rubbish, and the fire caused damage to the owner’s property and dog boarding business, the neighbor’s behavior was sufficiently egregious to trigger the jury’s assessment of $500 in punitive damages under this section because the neighbor acted with reckless indifference when she mocked the property owner for raising concerns before she started the fire; in addition, the two fires were sizable, the wind was blowing in the direction of the owner’s property, the fires consumed objects containing lead, the fires deposited a great deal of ash, and explosions within the fires threw pieces of metal onto his property.

        Superior court holding that it could award no punitive damages since it had awarded no compensatory damages because a personal representative's allegations were not contested and should have been viewed as proven upon entry of default was incorrect; the allegations reasonably established a hospital employee's reckless indifference to an elderly woman's health, safety, and property interests and hence were a sufficient basis for an award of punitive damages.

        The amount of punitive damages awarded by the jury in air service’s breach of contract and misrepresentation action against an individual and his wholly-owned corporation was not excessive in light of the reprehensibility of the individual’s conduct, the necessity of penalizing the type of fraud, and the potential penalties the individual faced under criminal and civil law.

        Fine assessed against a limited liability company (LLC) for campaign violations was not so excessive that it would violate Alaska or federal law regarding punitive damages. The LLC was a sophisticated entity with substantial assets and knowledgeable management, and its actions called into question the fairness of an election; the fine sent a message that the Alaska Public Offices Commission takes violations seriously, and helped deter other corporations from engaging in similar misconduct.

        Modification of common-law rule. —

      </p>
      <p>
       This statute modified the common-law collateral source rule by allowing the court to reduce an injured party’s jury award to reflect unsubrogated collateral source payments in certain situations, thereby limiting the circumstances in which a victim can receive double recovery while enhancing the chances that a tortfeasor may not be held fully accountable.

       Direct mid-trial payment from defendant’s insurer to plaintiff’s insurer, as reimbursement for paid medical expenses, did not convert the subrogated medical expenses which plaintiff’s insurer incurred on his behalf into unsubrogated benefits subject to offset under subsection (a), where documents in the records related to the payment failed to establish it as a collateral-source payment to be deducted from the jury’s award.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendants’ motion in limine to exclude evidence of medical bills submitted to the state in excess of the amounts paid by Medicaid was denied. Under this section the correct procedure is to permit a plaintiff to produce evidence of the value of his or her medical treatment, regardless of whether the plaintiff actually shouldered the cost, and then to permit a defendant to introduce evidence of amounts received from a collateral source after the fact finder had rendered an award.
       Dunkin v. Dorel Asia SRL, — F. Supp. 2d — (D. Alaska Mar. 15, 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of full amounts of an injured party's medical bills was admissible—when medical care providers accepted less than the full medical bills from Medicare as payment in full—because the amounts actually billed were relevant evidence of the reasonable value of the medical services. The difference between the amounts billed and the amounts paid was subject to the collateral source rule, so that evidence of amounts paid was excluded from jury's consideration but was subject to post-trial proceedings for possible reduction of damages award.

        Because the allocation of a portion of fault to nonparties is not permitted by this section, nor practical in the courtroom, the defendant must join any potentially liable actors and articulate in third-party complaints the manner in which those actors caused the plaintiff’s injuries. This having been done, the trier of fact will then be able to accurately allocate a portion of fault to each party. Robinson v. U-Haul Co., 785 F. Supp. 1378 (D. Alaska 1992).

        No fault could be apportioned in a timber trespass suit to a neighboring owner who had given other neighbors permission to remove trees from her land, because she had no duty to investigate and disclose the boundaries of her property in the absence of a business transaction; moreover, there was no evidence that she had intentionally caused the removal of a large number of trees beyond the boundary line, which was unforeseeable.

        Evidence of an employer’s negligence may be relevant and admissible in an employee’s action against third-party tortfeasors to prove that the employer was entirely at fault, or that the employer’s fault was a superseding cause of the injury. Under this section, the finder of fact may allocate all or none of the total fault to the employer.

       <p>
        It was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to announce for the first time after counsel had made closing arguments that the allocation of fault issue in a wrongful termination case would go to the jury; the trial court submitted the disputed special verdict form on fault allocation without allowing either the employer or the employee the benefit of closing arguments or explanatory jury instructions, which prejudiced both sides. Because an instruction on allocation of fault was not called for, as the definition of the cause of action, interference with an employment contract, did not allow a finding that the harm a customer’s employee caused was partly justified, the proper remedy on remand was to strike the 30 percent allocation of fault against the employee and to amend the awards against the customer and its employee.

     <p>
      In this chapter, “fault” includes acts or omissions that are in any measure negligent, reckless, or intentional toward the person or property of the actor or others, or that subject a person to strict tort liability. The term also includes breach of warranty, unreasonable assumption of risk not constituting an enforceable express consent, misuse of a product for which the defendant otherwise would be liable, and unreasonable failure to avoid an injury or to mitigate damages. Legal requirements of causal relation apply both to fault as the basis for liability and to contributory fault.

       Inmate's post-conviction relief petition was properly dismissed as untimely because, (1) while the petition was initially timely filed, the inmate did not pay the filing fee or include required financial documentation for a reduced fee, and (2) the inmate did not remedy this defect within a reasonable time, as despite being advised of the defect, the inmate did not remedy the defect for over three years after filing the initial petition and did not explain the delay.

       Except as provided in (b) and (e) of this section, a court may not order prospective relief in a civil action with respect to correctional facility conditions unless the court finds that (1) the plaintiff has proven a violation of a state or federal right, (2) the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and extends no further than is necessary to correct the violation of the right, (3) the prospective relief is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the right, and (4) the prisoner exhausted all administrative remedies available to the prisoner before filing the civil action. When a court finds multiple violations of a state or federal right, when multiple remedies are ordered by the prospective relief, or when prospective relief applies to multiple correctional facilities, the findings required by this subsection shall be made as to each violation, each remedy, and each facility, as appropriate. In a civil action with respect to correctional facility conditions that has been certified as a class action, prospective relief applicable to the class may only be ordered after the court makes the findings required by this subsection and finds that the violation of a state or federal right is applicable to the entire class. In making the findings required under this subsection, the court shall give substantial weight to any adverse effect on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the prospective relief.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c19s09.19.200ol1b">
       In a civil action with respect to correctional facility conditions, to the extent otherwise authorized by law, the court may enter a temporary restraining order or an order for preliminary injunctive relief only if the court finds that the relief is (1) narrowly drawn and extends no further than is necessary to correct the harm that requires preliminary relief, and (2) the least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm. In making the findings required under this subsection, the court shall give substantial weight to any adverse effect on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the preliminary relief. Preliminary injunctive relief shall automatically expire 90 days after the entry of the order unless the court orders final relief in the civil action before the expiration of the 90-day period.

       Prospective relief ordered in a civil action with respect to correctional facility conditions, including prospective relief ordered under a consent decree, regardless of whether that civil action was filed or the relief ordered before or after August 30, 1999, shall be terminated upon the motion of the defendant unless the court finds that there exists a current violation of a state or federal right and makes the findings required by (a) of this section as to each current violation and as to each remedy and facility, as appropriate. A civil action that has been certified as a class action shall be terminated upon the motion of the defendant unless the court makes the findings required by this subsection and finds that the current violation of a state or federal right is applicable to the entire class. Prospective relief must be modified upon the motion of a party whenever, and to the extent, the findings required by this section no longer apply to one or more provisions of the prospective relief then in effect. This subsection and the time limits provided in (d) of this section do not prevent a party from seeking modification or termination before the relief is otherwise terminable under this section to the extent that modification or termination would otherwise be legally permissible.

       Notwithstanding (a) of this section, in a civil action with respect to correctional facility conditions, a court may order prospective relief as provided in a consent decree without complying with (a) of this section, provided the prospective relief does not continue for a period of more than two years unless the court finds and orders that the continuation of the relief is appropriate under the standards in (c) of this section. In addition, parties may enter into private settlement agreements that do not comply with the limitations of relief set out in (a) of this section if the terms of the agreements are not subject to court enforcement other than the reinstatement of the civil proceedings that the agreements settled.

       The court shall promptly rule on a motion to modify or terminate prospective relief in a civil action with respect to correctional facility conditions. A motion to modify or terminate prospective relief made under this section stays the order for prospective relief beginning on the 90th day after the motion is filed, and the stay ends on the date the court enters a final order ruling on the motion. An automatic stay under this subsection may be postponed by the court for not more than 30 days for good cause.

      A person may have jury service deferred if the person shows that jury service at the time for which the person is summoned will cause hardship to that person or another, that transportation problems make it temporarily impossible for the person to serve, or that the person summoned is employed as a full-time or temporary election official and the jury service is during the month in which a primary or general election is held. Jury service may be deferred under this section only if the person seeking the deferment agrees to a deferred date. Jury service may not be deferred for more than 10 months from the date the initial jury service was to begin.

        As for cases arising outside the urban and predominantly non-Native centers of Alaska, two acceptable and feasible alternatives may be employed in selecting jurors. First, jurors may be selected from among residents of the entire judicial district in which the crime is alleged to have occurred. A second alternative, one which is perhaps at the same time more desirable and more workable than the first, would be selection of jurors from the senate election district in which the crime is alleged to have occurred.
        Either of these alternatives would be calculated to produce jury panels satisfying the constitutional requirement of impartiality. Alvarado v. State, 486 P.2d 891 (Alaska 1971).

      A person who has been served in good faith with a subpoena to attend as a witness before a court, judge, referee, or other official is exonerated from arrest in a civil action while going to the place of attendance, necessarily remaining there, and returning from there.

The officer wilfully making it is responsible to the witness arrested for double the amount of damages that may be assessed against the witness, and is also liable to an action at the suit of the party serving the witness with the subpoena for the damages sustained by the party in consequence of the arrest.

        The word “subscribed” means, as used in the statute of frauds, a signature of the person to be charged placed immediately at the end of a printed or written instrument. Geist v. O'Connor, 92 F. Supp. 451, 13 Alaska 15 (D. Alaska 1950).

       <p>
        If the lex loci contractus is procedural and the law of Alaska is primarily substantive, the fundamental public policy of Alaska should require that no contract invalid under the Alaska statute of frauds, if made in Alaska, escapes invalidity under the statute of frauds just because it is made outside of Alaska. Alaska Airlines v. Stephenson, 217 F.2d 295, 15 Alaska 272 (9th Cir. Alaska 1954).

        If an agreement required to be in writing under the statute of frauds is modified by a subsequent oral agreement, which does not in itself constitute a contract within the statute of frauds, the modification is valid and binding upon the parties.

        In a dispute between a discontinued church and the Alaska Missionary Conference concerning real property and entitlement to the church’s corporate entity, although an agreement to establish a trust was unenforceable unless it or some note of it was in writing, the writings under consideration, including a certificate of organization, the church’s request to join the Alaska Missionary Conference, and the report of pastors, were sufficient evidence of an intent to form a trust to satisfy the statute of frauds, paragraph (a)(9) of this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement of this section that the authority of an agent to enter into an agreement concerning real property must be in writing was satisfied by a power of attorney from one co-owner of a mining claim to another, where although the instrument itself was not in evidence, its existence was conclusively established by the uncontradicted testimony of one of the co-owners that he had such a power of attorney from the other, but that it had been destroyed or had expired at the time of the trial; also that he had written the other of his action in entering into a contract agreeing to transfer an interest in the claim and had received a reply that it was satisfactory, but that he did not have the letters.

         The foundation of jurisdiction under subsection (b). —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The jurisdiction is based upon the just principle that when acts of part performance have been done in pursuance of and in reliance on the verbal contract, with the knowledge and consent of the other party, and the relations of the parties are so changed by reason thereof as to prevent a restoration to their former condition, it would be a fraud and encourage bad faith to permit the statute to be interposed as a defense, whereby one party would reap the benefit of the acts of part performance, and the other be left without any remedy, and liable for damages as a trespasser. Treat v. Ellis, 6 Alaska 290 (D. Alaska 1920).

        <b>
         Equity does not deny nor overrule the statute of frauds,
        </b>

        <b>
         Equity relaxes rigid rule of statute to prevent fraud. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute of frauds requires a contract concerning real estate to be in writing, but courts of equity have stepped in and relaxed the rigidity of this rule, and hold that a part performance removes the bar of the statute, on the ground that it is a fraud for the vendor to insist on the absence of a written instrument, when he had permitted the contract to be partly executed. Treat v. Ellis, 6 Alaska 290 (D. Alaska 1920).

       </p>
       <p>
        When the vendee takes and retains possession in pursuance of a verbal agreement and makes improvements upon the land, he thereby acquires an equitable estate in the premises and to deny him the right to establish the terms of the verbal contract upon the faith of which he acted would permit the vendor to practice a fraud. Mitchell v. Land, 355 P.2d 682 (Alaska 1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the purchaser has gained more by the possession and use of the land than he has lost by his improvements, or if he has been in fact fully compensated for the improvements, they will not be available to him as a ground for specific execution. Treat v. Ellis, 6 Alaska 290 (D. Alaska 1920).

        <b>
         Payment of purchase price is not sufficient part performance. —

       <p>
        The mere payment of the purchase price by the vendee, without other acts, is not sufficient as an act of part performance to take an oral contract for the sale of real estate out of the statute of frauds. Mitchell v. Land, 355 P.2d 682 (Alaska 1960).

         Although part payment, tender and taking possession is enough. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Possession of premises by the purchaser, in connection with payment of part of the price and a tender of the balance, is such part performance as to entitle him to a decree for specific performance. Geist v. O'Connor, 92 F. Supp. 451, 13 Alaska 15 (D. Alaska 1950).

       <p>
        Possession by the vendee in pursuance of an oral agreement for the sale of land must be notorious, exclusive, continuous, and maintained. Mitchell v. Land, 355 P.2d 682 (Alaska 1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        The possession that will be deemed a part performance of a parol contract is an actual possession, taken by the vendee under the contract, with the consent of the vendor, and with a view to the performance of the agreement, and not the fictitious possession which the law imputes to the legal ownership when there was no actual adverse possession. Treat v. Ellis, 6 Alaska 290 (D. Alaska 1920).

        With respect to inadequacy of consideration, in conjunction with other inequitable circumstances the weight of each circumstance is greatly increased by its conjunction with the other, and such circumstances are often of decisive influence in determining the unfairness of the contract; such circumstances are undue influence, ignorance of one’s legal rights, or a marked inequality of the parties.

       Rules for construing real estate descriptions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The following are the rules for construing the descriptive part of a conveyance of real property when the construction is doubtful and there are no other sufficient circumstances to determine it:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t09c25a01s09.25.040ol11">
       where there are certain definite and ascertained particulars in the description, the addition of others which are indefinite, unknown, or false does not frustrate the conveyance, but it is to be construed by those particulars if they constitute a sufficient description to ascertain its application:
      </li>
      <li id="t09c25a01s09.25.040ol12">
       when permanent and visible or ascertained boundaries or monuments are inconsistent with the measurement, either of lines, angles, or surfaces, the boundaries or monuments are paramount:
      </li>
      <li id="t09c25a01s09.25.040ol13">
       between different measurements which are inconsistent with each other, that of angles is paramount to that of surfaces, and that of lines paramount to both:
      </li>
      <li id="t09c25a01s09.25.040ol14">
       when a road or stream of water not navigable is the boundary, the rights of the grantor to the middle of the road or the thread of the stream are included in the conveyance, except where the road or bed of the stream is held under another title:
      </li>
      <li id="t09c25a01s09.25.040ol15">
       when tidewater is the boundary, the rights of the grantor to low-water mark are included in the conveyance:
      </li>
      <li id="t09c25a01s09.25.040ol16">
       when the description refers to a map and that reference is inconsistent with other particulars, it controls them if it appears that the parties acted with reference to the map; otherwise the map is subordinate to other definite and ascertained particulars.

       A deed must be construed according to its legal construction, effect, and operation apparent on its face, or with the aid of any such evidence as is admissible by the rules of law to explain it. Valdez Bank v. Von Gunther, 3 Alaska 657 (D. Alaska 1909).

       For the sole purpose of finding and executing the real intention of the parties, the court will place itself, as nearly as possible, in the position of the parties when the deed was executed, and consider all the surrounding circumstances, the situation of the parties and the property, and in fact, all sources of information naturally suggested by the description of the property in the conveyance, or which may have acted upon the minds of the parties.

        Sufficiency of legal description. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Alaska law, the street address contained in a deed of trust sufficiently identified the real property to create a valid secured interest in that property because the legal description for the property could be ascertained through an address search for the property in the website for the Municipality of Anchorage, Alaska.

        Intent must be effectuated if possible. —

      <p>
       Deeds must be so construed as to effectuate, if possible, the intention of the parties, unless such intention be inconsistent with settled rules of law regarding the subject matter in the case, or unless the terms of the deed itself — the expressions used therein — positively forbid or make it impossible to effectuate the real intentions of the parties.

        Metes and bounds prevail over erroneous statement of acreage. —

      <p>
       When a deed describes the land by metes and bounds and makes an erroneous statement as to the acreage involved, the deed conveys the land as described by metes and bounds and in disregard of the alleged acreage. Seltenreich v. Town of Fairbanks, 103 F. Supp. 319, 13 Alaska 582 (D. Alaska 1952), aff'd, 211 F.2d 83, 14 Alaska 568 (9th Cir. Alaska 1954).

      <p>
       A placer location will not be void for a discrepancy between the courses and distances mentioned in the notice and the stakes and monuments set by the locator to mark the boundaries of his claim; where there is such a conflict, the stakes and monuments must prevail, if they are sufficient to identify the claim.

       </p>
       <p>
        Under the common law, a transfer by an insolvent debtor to pay or to secure an antecedent debt has never been treated as a transfer to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, although it is self-evident that other creditors are necessarily hindered and delayed by such a transfer. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        At common law it was not illegal for a debtor to pay one of his creditors in full, even though he did not have enough left to pay his other creditors in full or even in part.
        Such a payment was not, and is not now, a fraudulent conveyance.
        The payment is merely the performance of an existing legal duty. Nor is it illegal for the debtor to transfer property as security for an existing debt; the value of the property in excess of the debt remains available to other creditors.
        The conveyance of property to a creditor in satisfaction of an existing debt is a fraudulent conveyance only in case its value is in excess of the debt and the purpose of the debtor is to keep that excess out of the hands of his other creditors. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971).

         Effect of presumption. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The presumption serves merely to shift to the vendee the burden of proving that a conveyance was made without fraudulent intent. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971); Rollins v. Leibold, 512 P.2d 937 (Alaska 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, if a vendee has failed to establish immediate and continued possession over personalty which he has purchased, and if he makes no effort to show that the transaction was entered into in good faith, then a finding of fraud will be compelled.
        Where, on the other hand, the grantee introduces evidence tending to show that the conveyance in question was transacted in good faith, then the presumption will be dispelled, and it will be incumbent upon the finder of fact to determine whether there was actually an intent to defraud creditors. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971); Rollins v. Leibold, 512 P.2d 937 (Alaska 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once the presumption is established the opposing party has the burden of proving that the non-existence of the presumed fact is more probable than its existence. Rollins v. Leibold, 512 P.2d 937 (Alaska 1973).

         Effect of fact that presumption statutory. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The only effect resulting from a presumption of fraud being a statutory presumption is that the party asserting fraud does not have to introduce evidence of fraudulent intent.
        He still must plead and prove the conditions necessary to invoke the presumption. Rollins v. Leibold, 512 P.2d 937 (Alaska 1973).

       <p>
        A showing that there was adequate consideration for the sale of property retained by a vendor tends to rebut the presumption of fraud that arises from its retention. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        While retention of possession by a vendor gives rise to a prima facie presumption of fraud, proof of payment of a valuable consideration for the property rebuts the presumption. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971).

        which concern fraudulent transfers of property, by erecting a prima facie presumption of fraud in cases where a sale of personal property is not “accompanied by the immediate delivery and the actual and continued possession” by the vendee. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the creditor offered a satisfactory explanation for his failure to take more overt steps in attempting to reestablish possession of a vessel, and where he further showed that the quitclaim deed delivered by the debtor was issued in exchange for valuable consideration, the trial court was unjustified in relying on the statutory presumption to invalidate as fraudulent the conveyance in question. Under these circumstances, the trial court should have considered the validity of the transaction as a question of fact pursuant to AS
        <cite class="ocak">
         <a href="gov.ak.code.title.34.html#t34c40s34.40.010" target="_blank">

        Accordingly, the court should have ruled on the issue whether, in the conveyance of the vessel to the creditor, there was an actual, as opposed to a presumed, intent to hinder, delay or defraud other creditors. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971).

       </p>
       <p>
        A bona fide preference by an insolvent debtor does not, in itself, constitute evidence of fraud. Blumenstein v. Phillips Ins. Ctr., 490 P.2d 1213 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of bankruptcy laws or express statutory prohibition, an insolvent debtor may convey property to one creditor, even if it means that the debtor’s assets will thereby be depleted, and the claims of other creditors will be defeated.

        While under this section, the fraud presumed from want of change in possession is confined to personal property, yet where both real and personal property were transferred by one instrument, which property constituted the entire estate of the debtor, and there was no actual change of possession of any of the property until long subsequent, this taken in connection with various other circumstances was sufficient to shift the burden of evidence as to the bona fides of the sale from the plaintiff to the defendants.

       <p>
        A statutory presumption of fraud, similar to fraud, falls within the definition of an adverse defense since a simple denial of the complaint would not raise such a defense. Rollins v. Leibold, 512 P.2d 937 (Alaska 1973).

     <p>
      A certified copy of the judgment or decree of a court of this state or a court of record of the United States upon which execution may issue, the enforcement of which has not been stayed, may be recorded with the recorder of a recording district.
      From the recording, the judgment or decree becomes a lien upon the real property of the defendant that is in the recording district, that is not exempt from execution, and that is owned by the defendant at the time or acquired by the defendant afterward but before the lien expires.
      The lien continues during the time execution may issue on the judgment or decree but for not more than 10 years from date of entry of the judgment or decree. After expiration of the lien, the court may grant leave for issuance of execution upon the judgment or decree.
      From the date of recording the judgment or decree, together with the order allowing issuance of execution, the judgment or decree becomes a lien in the manner provided in this section.

       At any time more than 10 days before the trial begins, either the party making a claim or the party defending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be entered in complete satisfaction of the claim for the money or property or to the effect specified in the offer, with costs then accrued. If within 10 days after the service of the offer the adverse party serves written notice that the offer is accepted, either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of service, and the clerk shall enter judgment. An offer not accepted within 10 days is considered withdrawn, and evidence of that offer is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine the form of judgment after verdict. If the judgment finally entered on the claim as to which an offer has been made under this section is at least five percent less favorable to the offeree than the offer, or if there are multiple defendants at least 10 percent less favorable to the offeree than the offer, the offeree, whether the party making the claim or defending against the claim, shall pay all costs as allowed under the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure and shall pay reasonable actual attorney fees incurred by the offeror from the date the offer was made, as follows:

       If an offeror receives costs and reasonable actual attorney fees under (a) of this section, that offeror shall be considered the prevailing party for purposes of an award of attorney fees under the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure. Notwithstanding (a) of this section, if the amount awarded an offeror for attorney fees under the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure is greater than a party would receive under (a) of this section, the offeree shall pay to the offeror attorney fees specified under the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure and is not required to pay reasonable actual attorney fees under (a) of this section. A party who receives attorney fees under this section may not also receive attorney fees under the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure.

       Where offer of judgment in personal injury lawsuit was for a set amount plus prejudgment interest from the date of the accident, the court must add prejudgment interest to the offer amount to compare its value to that of the subsequent judgment in order to determine whether the offer was more favorable than final judgment.

       The trial court’s award of full attorney’s fees violated paragraph (a)(1), and because Alaska Civ.

       In insured’s action against insurer alleging that insurer wrongfully refused to pay the policy limits of UIM coverage, trial court did not err in holding insurer’s first offer of judgment not valid because the offer of judgment did not include every claim and would not have ended the entire litigation between the parties. Progressive Corp. v. Peter, 195 P.3d 1083 (Alaska 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Offer of judgment was valid because the employer of a driver who was involved in an auto accident made separate offers of judgment to a parent and the parent's child, who were injured in the accident, when they brought separate claims, which offers they rejected.

      </p>
      <p>
       Offer of judgment is not premature or invalid even if it was made before the parties made Alaska R. Civ. P. 26 disclosures; therefore, attorney’s fees were properly awarded to the holder of a first deed of trust in an action concerning a dispute over a foreclosure sale where the offer was made prior to discovery disclosures.

      </p>
      <p>
       An offer of judgment made under Civil Rule 68 or this statute requires that costs allowable under Rule 79, and attorney’s fees on a noncontested or partially contested basis under Rule 82, be awarded in addition to the principal sum specified in the offer.

       Property owner’s second filing advanced nearly identical legal claims to his initial case, which was dismissed without prejudice, and thus, dual awards of attorney’s fees under both Alaska R. Civ. P. 68 and 82 was precluded. Tagaban v. City of Pelican, 358 P.3d 571 (Alaska 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Offer of judgment was valid because the employer of a driver who was involved in an auto accident made separate offers of judgment to a parent and the parent's child, who were injured in the accident, when they brought separate claims, which offers they rejected. Moreover, the court properly awarded the employer partial attorney's fees because the parent's award was less than 95 percent of the offer made to the parent, and the court did not err in excluding costs not covered by the civil rules when comparing the offer to the parent's recovery.

      To establish the recoverable cost, DEC may use the prejudgment interest formula in this section, and may base the formula rate on the appropriate discount rate on either January 2 of each calendar year or July 1 of each fiscal year for which the cost is owed.
      The date upon which interest begins to accrue should be the date on which DEC provides notice to the responsible party that identifies the expenditure and requests payment. October 6, 1999 Op. Atty. Gen.

        Once a superior court exercised its discretion and determined that post-judgment interest was appropriate on an equalization payment which the court ordered in a divorce action, the court did not err in setting the interest rate because the court correctly applied the proper statute in setting the interest rate.

        Court incorrectly calculated the start date for prejudgment interest where, although the defendant attorney learned on October 27, 1999, that his client had committed wrongdoing leading to the client’s ward’s loss, it was not until August 16, 2001, when the attorney received the ward’s demand letter, that he learned that she would be pursuing a claim against him.

        Prejudgment interest in contract dispute, awarded under subsection (b) of this section from the date when the buyer sent a letter that included a threat of litigation, was not erroneous; a contract cause of action usually accrues at the time of the breach of the agreement, rather than the time that actual damages are sustained as a consequence of the breach.

        Subsection (b) does not require direct notice from the prospective claimant; rather, the statute establishes an objective test providing that interest begins to accrue upon written notice that would lead a prudent person to believe that a claim will be made against the person receiving the notification.

        Civil contempt unavailable to enforce reversed foreign civil contempt judgment. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to enforce an Oregon civil contempt judgment against a judgment debtor based on an alleged violation of a settlement agreement because an Oregon appellate court reversed both the contempt judgment and the underlying civil judgment, leaving a judgment creditor with only contract remedies for the alleged breach, which the creditor did not seek, as the civil contempt order was no longer predicated on a valid foreign judgment.

       Satisfaction of a judgment may be entered upon an execution returned satisfied, or upon an acknowledgment of satisfaction filed with the clerk, which may recite payment of the judgment in full or the acceptance by the judgment creditor of any lesser sum in full satisfaction of the judgment, made in the manner of an acknowledgment of a conveyance of real property by the judgment creditor or assignee of record, or by the attorney for the judgment creditor or assignee unless a revocation of the attorney’s authority is filed.  When a judgment is satisfied otherwise than upon an execution, the judgment creditor or the judgment creditor’s attorney shall deliver a written acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment suitable for recordation immediately upon payment in cash or within 10 days after payment if payment is made in any other manner, and, upon motion, the court may compel an acknowledgment of satisfaction or may order the entry of satisfaction to be made without it.  When the state or an authorized officer or agency of the state is the judgment creditor, a written acknowledgment of satisfaction shall be delivered within 15 days after payment in cash or within 30 days after payment if payment is made in any other manner. The entry of satisfaction shall be made upon the civil docket of the court rendering the judgment satisfied.

      Writs of execution may be against the property of the judgment debtor, another against the person of the judgment debtor, and a third for the delivery of the possession of real or personal property, including damages for withholding the property.

      <li id="t09c35s09.35.030ol11">

     <p>
      All sales of property upon execution shall be made at auction between nine o’clock in the morning and four o’clock in the afternoon.
      After sufficient property has been sold to satisfy the execution, no more may be sold.
      Neither the officer holding the execution nor a deputy may become a purchaser or be interested in a purchase at the sale.
      When the sale is of personal property capable of manual delivery, it shall be within view of those who attend the sale unless the court directs the sale to be at some other place.
      The property shall be sold in parcels that are likely to bring the highest price. When the sale is of real property consisting of several known lots or parcels, they shall be sold separately or otherwise, as is likely to bring the highest price.
      When a portion of real property is claimed by a third person, that person may require it to be sold separately.

       A Forest Service permit for the use of lands for the purpose of canning salmon and which granted no estate in the land, was revocable at will, and was not assignable except on approval of government officers, was merely a license, and if it could be sold at all under execution it should be sold as personal property.

       Where a Forest Service permit for the use of lands provided that structures erected might be removed, and the construction of the buildings was for purposes of trade, the intention of the parties to the permit was that the buildings erected on the land should not be a part of the freehold; therefore the structures erected on the land embraced in the permit and the machinery attached to the buildings were considered personal property, and were lawfully sold as such.

       A dock, having been erected on land and over waters (held in trust by the United States and reserved for the benefit of the future state) by a salmon packer under an implied license from the United States for the purpose of trade, is not a part of the real estate, and should be sold as personal property since there is an implied agreement by the United States that such structures may be removed at the will of the temporary occupant of the site.

       Where purchaser in default had subdivided land and built roads, but the deed of trust gave trustee the discretion to sell lots or parcels or to sell the whole of the property, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to sellers in purchaser’s action to set aside the sale. McHugh v. Church, 583 P.2d 210 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although it has dealt with the issue of whether real property consisting of separate lots should be sold in lots or as a whole in the context of execution sales, Alaska’s legislature has not addressed the subject of sales by a trustee under a deed of trust where the real property consists of several parcels or lots.

        Confirmation of a sale on a legal execution is a purely statutory proceeding, and, when granted, attests simply that the proceedings connected with the sale are regular.

         Effect of irregularities in preliminary proceedings. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Although mere irregularities in preliminary proceedings are insufficient to set aside confirmed sale, it is the general rule in the United States that the confirmation of a judicial sale by a court of competent jurisdiction cures all irregularities in the proceeding leading up to or in the conduct of the sale, and that while such a sale will be set aside where fraud, mistake, or surprise is shown, mere irregularities in the preliminary proceedings do not render the sale invalid, and will not suffice to set it aside after confirmation.
        This section is in accord with this general rule. Heid v. Ebner, 133 F. 156, 2 Alaska Fed. 300 (9th Cir. Alaska 1904); Cowden v. Wild Goose Mining &amp; Trading Co., 199 F. 561, 3 Alaska Fed. 874 (9th Cir. Alaska 1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        If there was irregularity in an equitable action in issuing an execution by the clerk because he did not make and deliver to the officer a certified copy of the decree for his execution, that was an irregularity merely, which was cured by the confirmation. Lesamis v. Greenberg, 225 F. 449, 4 Alaska Fed. 340 (9th Cir. Alaska 1915).

      When property liable to an execution against several persons is sold and more than a due proportion of the judgment is satisfied out of the proceeds of the sale of the property of one of them or one of them pays more than a due proportion without a sale, that person may compel contributions from the others.
      When a judgment is against several and is upon an obligation of one of them as security for another and the surety pays the amount or a part of it, either by sale of the surety’s property or before sale, the surety may compel repayment from the principal.
      In that case, the person so paying or contributing is entitled to the benefit of the judgment to enforce contribution or repayment if the person files notice of payment and claim to contribution or repayment with the court where the judgment was rendered within 30 days after the payment.

      <p>
       While this section gives the purchaser at a confirmed sale the right of possession during the period for redemption, it does not mean that the purchaser has that right as against a prior bona fide grantee of the judgment debtor, or survivor of such grantee. Pecaravich v. Gilmore, 6 Alaska 108 (1918).

       When a judgment debtor redeems, he may recover the value of a crop growing upon the land at the time of the sale and harvested by the purchaser while in possession.
       It follows that the product of the property must in all cases be accounted for to the redemptioner. Ziller v. Brower, 6 Alaska 134 (D. Alaska 1919).

      </p>
      <p>
       It is the duty of the mortgagee in possession, or the purchaser at a judicial sale, to furnish to the redemptioner a statement of rents, issues, and profits collected by the purchaser between the date of purchase and the date of redemption, and also to exhibit to such redemptioner a statement of the offsets against such collections.

       If property owned by the entirety or in common is used by one or more individual owners or their dependents as their principal residence, each owner is entitled to a homestead exemption of that owner’s interest in the property as provided in (a) of this section.  The aggregate value of multiple homestead exemptions allowable with respect to a single living unit may not exceed $54,000.  If there are multiple owners of property exempt as a homestead, the value of the exemption of each individual owner may not exceed the individual owner’s pro rata portion of $54,000.

       If property that includes a homestead is sold under an execution, the sale becomes effective upon confirmation by order of the court.  The court shall enter the order of confirmation unless, within 60 days after the sale, the individual repurchases the property under this section or the court extends the time for confirmation upon the filing of a timely motion by a party in interest.  The individual may repurchase property, including that individual’s homestead, at a sale on execution before confirmation by paying into court the costs of the sale plus the lesser of either (1) the difference between the highest bid and the amount of the exemption in the property, or (2) the amount of the creditor’s claim. If the individual does not exercise the repurchase right under this subsection, the clerk of the court shall first remit an amount determined to be exempt to the individual from the proceeds of sale and the balance less the cost of the sale to the creditor. For the purpose of collecting an amount remaining unpaid on a judgment after repurchase of property by an individual under this subsection, the creditor or the creditor’s assignee may not make another levy on the property repurchased.

       Debtor failed to establish that he was entitled to an Alaska homestead exemption, as he did not show actual occupancy on a regular basis at least at some point in time and the evidence failed to show that the property was his true, substantial, and real residence on the date of his bankruptcy petition. He had not lived on the property since October 2014 after he voluntarily conveyed the property to a friend, he had not paid real estate taxes on the property for some time prior to that or after the property was reconveyed to him, his personal effects and pets were at a rental property that was his primary residence, and there was no permanent inhabitable improvement on the property.

       Section 522(f) of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C.] provides that “.

       . the debtor may avoid the fixing of a [judicial] lien on .
       .
       . property to the extent that such lien impairs an exemption .
       .
       .
       .” To determine whether there is such an impairment of a homestead exemption, the following steps are taken by the court: (1) all liens are ranked in order of priority (and equity, if any) to the extent of the value of the property; (2) the gross amount of the homestead exemption is subtracted from the value of the property; and (3) from the remainder left, each lien is subtracted, one at a time, beginning with the most senior lien, until a judicial lien is reached. Then the judicial lien is subtracted.
       To the extent that all or any portion of the judicial lien exceeds the remainder derived in (2), above, it is voidable. In re Duncan, 43 B.R. 833 (Bankr. D. Alaska 1984).

     <p>
      This section is incompatible in many respects with 15 U.S.C. § 1673, which places limits on garnishment of wages, and as a result, where state law would permit garnishment of wages in excess of that permitted by federal law, the state law must give way and federal limitations be applied.
      November 15, 1982, Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The preemption by 15 U.S.C. § 1673 is limited. Under the provisions of 15 U.S.C. §§ 1673(c) and 1677 as interpreted by various state courts, when a state law conflicts with the federal garnishment provisions, each garnishment must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, and after consideration of both the federal and state formulas, whichever results in the least amount garnished should be applied.

      Section 24, ch. 57, SLA 1991 provides that the amendments made to subsection (a) by § 3, ch. 57, SLA 1991 “apply to a levy to enforce a claim if the claim arises from a crime committed on or after September 15, 1991.”

      Section 45, ch. 92, SLA 2001, provides that the amendment to subsection (a) and the repeal of subsection (d), made by ch. 92, SLA 2001, apply “to judgments or orders of restitution entered in adjudications of delinquency of minors or in criminal cases before, on, or after January 1, 2002.”

       The dollar amounts in this chapter change, as provided in this section, according to and to the extent of changes in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers for the Anchorage Metropolitan Area compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor (the index).  The index for January of 1982 is the reference base index.

       If the index is revised, the percentage of change is calculated on the basis of the revised index.  If a revision of the index changes the reference base index, a revised reference base index is determined by multiplying the reference base index applicable by the rebasing factor furnished by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.

       The defendants whose property is to be attached have a right to a bond complying with the provisions of this section in order that they know exactly the terms upon which they may proceed against the bondsmen and in order that it may not happen that, when the clerk concludes that the case is finished, he shall hand back the check or the cash and leave them without recourse except against him.

      If real property is attached, the peace officer shall make a certificate containing the title of the cause, the names of the parties, a description of the property attached, the date of attachment, a statement that a writ of attachment has been issued, and the date of issuance, and shall within 10 days deliver the certificate to the recorder of the recording district in which the real property is situated.
      The recorder shall record the certificate in a book to be kept for that purpose. When the certificate is recorded, the lien in favor of the plaintiff attaches to the real property described in the certificate from the date of the attachment, but if recorded afterwards, it only attaches as against third persons from the date of the subsequent recording.
      Whenever the lien is discharged, it is the duty of the recorder, when requested, to record the transcript of an order, entry of satisfaction of judgment, or other proceeding of record whereby it appears that the lien has been discharged.

       Where no order for sale of attached property is included in the judgment but a personal judgment only is rendered, the attachment is discharged. Love v. Pavlovich, 222 F. 842, 4 Alaska Fed. 293 (9th Cir. Alaska 1915).

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the plaintiff recovered a judgment against the defendant, if he wished to preserve and enforce the lien of his attachment against the personal property of the defendant, he was required by the provisions of this section to see that the court order the property to be sold to satisfy his demands, and the failure to do so upon his part and the presenting to and securing from the court of the entry of a personal judgment merely against said defendant constituted a waiver of the lien of his attachment, and precluded a recovery upon the redelivery bond given to secure the same.

      <p>
       The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the subject of the controversy in its present condition, in order to prevent the perpetration of a wrong, or the doing of an act whereby the subject of the controversy may be materially injured or endangered, until a full investigation of the case may be had.

      <p>
       The granting or withholding of an injunction pendente lite ordinarily rests in the sound discretion of the court to which the application is made, and unless there has been a plain disregard of the facts or of the settled principles of equity applicable thereto, the exercise of the discretion of that court is not subject to reversal. Vogel v. Warsing, 146 F. 949, 2 Alaska Fed. 628 (9th Cir. Alaska 1906); Alaska, Pac. Ry. &amp; Terminal Co. v. Copper River &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., 160 F. 862, 3 Alaska Fed. 19 (9th Cir. Alaska 1908).

      </p>
      <p>
       The test as to the granting of a preliminary injunction is that where the plaintiff’s right is not clear or is somewhat doubtful or where the defendant raises grave doubts as to the validity or existence of the right asserted, and the preservation of the status quo would result in far greater loss and hardship to the defendant if the injunction is granted than to the plaintiff if it is issued, and the plaintiff may be adequately compensated in money, a preliminary injunction should be denied. United States v. Libby, McNeill &amp; Libby, 98 F. Supp. 601, 13 Alaska 387 (D. Alaska 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       That the plaintiff is “probably right” does not constitute sufficient ground for issuing a preliminary injunction. P. E. Harris &amp; Co. v. Bell, 8 Alaska 416 (D. Alaska 1933).

       A showing of an actual loss of customers or of particular pecuniary damages or inadequacy of the remedy at law need not be made where the buyer of a business seeks an injunction to restrain the seller who has executed a covenant not to compete.
       Irreparable injuries of the above type are presumed to result from a violation of the covenant not to compete. The rule is grounded in the unfairness of requiring the production of evidence which is so difficult to obtain. Barber v. Northern Heating Oil, 447 P.2d 72 (Alaska 1968).

       Plaintiffs in an ejectment action were not limited in their remedy under the Alaska Code to a judgment in an action of ejectment restoring them to possession of the premises in controversy, but upon the showing that the value of the ground in controversy consisted of gold-bearing earth, sand, and gravel, and the admissions of the defendants that they were severing and extracting this gold-bearing material, the removal of which would necessarily destroy the value of the ground and render ineffectual any judgment that might be attained in an ejectment suit, the plaintiffs were also entitled, under this section, to the equitable relief of an injunction pending litigation.

       A dispute between rival operators of set nets engaged in fishing for salmon in the tidal waters of Alaska, where plaintiff sought to enjoin the fishing operations of the defendants, claiming his own fishing to be lawful and that of the defendants unlawful, and defendants asserted the validity of their own fishing is a proper case for injunctive relief. Fisher v. Everett, 66 F. Supp. 540, 11 Alaska 1 (D. Alaska 1945), limited, Miller v. Snug Harbor Packing Co., 121 F. Supp. 939, 15 Alaska 81 (D. Alaska 1954).

       To establish the necessity of the appointment of a receiver in an equitable suit of a creditor of a corporation to recover from a defendant who allegedly acquired the debtor’s assets in a scheme to defraud creditors, it must be shown by clear proof that there is imminent danger that, unless a receiver is appointed, the property involved will deteriorate in value or be wasted, and that the plaintiff will thereby suffer irreparable loss.

      <p>
       As a general rule to warrant the interposition of a court of equity by the aid of a receiver, it is essential that plaintiff should know, first, either a clear, legal right in himself to the property in controversy, or that he has some lien upon it, or that it constitutes a special fund out of which he is entitled to satisfaction of his demand; and, secondly, it must appear that possession of the property was obtained by defendant through fraud, or that the property itself, or the income from it, is in danger of loss from the neglect, waste, misconduct, or insolvency of the defendant.

       In the winding up of a partnership’s affairs, where there was no evidence adduced to suggest any reasons for appointing a receiver, and there was no indication in the record that the partnership assets would not be properly accounted for or that they were in danger of being lost through neglect, waste, misconduct, or insolvency, a receiver need not have been appointed.

      <p>
       The burden of showing the existence of a partnership at the time of application for a receiver rests upon the plaintiff, and where the existence of a partnership is directly in dispute and is denied by defendant in an action for an account, the court will not appoint a receiver in limine unless the property is in danger of loss.

      </p>
      <p>
       If the word “corporation” in this section were construed to include a municipal or quasi-municipal corporation in a case where a court attempts to appoint a receiver to enforce collection of public utility district taxes by the sale of taxed property, it would result in an encroachment by the judiciary in a field that is inherently and traditionally subject only to legislative control.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although the general rule is that a receiver’s compensation and expenses are payable from the funds in his hands, and are not taxable against the party at whose instance the receiver was appointed, an exception arises when there is no fund out of which the expenses can be paid and such circumstances exist that it would be inequitable not to hold the party responsible who invoked the processes of the court to have the receiver appointed.

       Where a receiver has unnecessarily prolonged a receivership when justice required that he be discharged and the receivership ended, or where a receiver has been guilty of a misconduct in the management of the property committed to his charge, the court may, if the circumstances warrant, deny him compensation.

        Where a state officer with the airport police and fire department was discharged for making inappropriate sexual remarks to two female officers, the labor organization that represented him filed a grievance under its collective bargaining agreement with the State and the matter went to arbitration. When an arbitrator ordered the Alaska Department of Transportation to reinstate the discharged officer, its decision was entitled to substantial deference and could not be vacated in the absence of gross error; the standards for vacating an arbitration award set forth in this section do not apply to a labor-management contract unless they are incorporated into the contract by reference.

        In light of Alaska’s strong public policy favoring arbitration, courts should apply a presumption in favor of arbitrability. If the arbitrator’s determination of arbitrability is a reasonably possible one that can seriously be made in the context in which the contract was made, then the court should affirm the finding.

         Limitation on judicial review. —

       <p>
        An arbitrator’s misconstruction of a contract is not open to judicial review, except on questions of arbitrability. Alaska State Hous. Auth. v. Riley Pleas, Inc., 586 P.2d 1244 (Alaska 1978); Ahtna, Inc. v. Ebasco Constructors, 894 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The insured’s argument that the arbitration panel exceeded its authority under paragraph (a)(3) by reducing its preliminary award without giving a complete explanation for the reduction was rejected because (a)(3) allows judicial review only to determine if an arbitration panel exceeded its powers, not for failure to give a complete explanation, and one of the primary powers explicitly granted to the arbitration panel by the governing insurance policy was the power to determine “the amount payable” under the policy. Wing v. Geico Ins. Co., 17 P.3d 783 (Alaska 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate court could not reassess facts presented to an arbitration panel or inquire into the merits of the panel’s decision because there was no evident partiality or corruption among the arbitrators. Haeg v. Cole, 200 P.3d 317 (Alaska), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 820, 130 S. Ct. 96, 175 L. Ed. 2d 30 (U.S. 2009).

         No review for gross errors. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The “fraud or other undue means” standard of this section does not authorize review for gross errors. Alaska State Hous. Auth. v. Riley Pleas, Inc., 586 P.2d 1244 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a substantial difference between procurement of an award by fraud or other undue means and an award in which the arbitrators have allegedly made large mistakes.
        The former instances connote affirmative wrongdoing by a party to the arbitration and often by an arbitrator; gross error carries no such connotation.
        Moreover, fraud or undue means in the procurement of an award does not require a review on the merits of the controversy; a review for gross errors is a review on the merits. Alaska State Hous. Auth. v. Riley Pleas, Inc., 586 P.2d 1244 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Alaska law it is clear that when arbitration proceeds under the terms of Alaska’s Uniform Arbitration Act, the arbitrator’s findings of fact are unreviewable, even in the case of gross error. Judicial review under this section is limited to issues of arbitrability. Ahtna, Inc. v. Ebasco Constructors, 894 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing in the record supported an insured’s allegations of fraud, undue means, or arbitrator bias; allegations of fraud essentially amounted to allegations of gross error which were not reviewable under (a)(1). The insured’s attack on a photo exhibit amounted to an allegation that the arbitrator’s findings represented gross error and were inconsistent with the evidence, and there was no evidence to support her claims that an independent medical review was fraudulent or that the arbitrator treated her claim unfairly. Gilbert v. State Farm Ins. Co., 171 P.3d 136 (Alaska 2007).

       <p>
        In a dispute regarding whether the real estate sold with a car dealership was contaminated, arbitrator’s award in favor of the buyer was upheld where the arbitrator did not exceed his authority under subsection (a)(3) of this section in rescinding the property contract, but not the asset purchase agreement. The question whether the sellers successfully negotiated for a single contract, as opposed to two separate contracts, was a question of fact, which was unreviewable under the Arbitration Act. Kinn v.

       </p>
       <p>
        When an award is attacked under this article on the grounds that the arbitrators exceeded their powers through erroneous interpretation of the contract, the reviewing court should determine whether the construction of the contract made by the arbitrators is a reasonably possible one that can seriously be made in the context in which the contract was made.

Ebasco Constructors, 894 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Stated affirmatively, if all fair and reasonable minds would agree that the construction of the contract made by the arbitrators was not possible under a fair interpretation of the contract, then the court would be bound to vacate or refuse to confirm the award. University of Alaska v. Modern Constr., 522 P.2d 1132 (Alaska 1974); Anchorage Medical &amp; Surgical Clinic v. James, 555 P.2d 1320 (Alaska 1976), overruled, Ahtna, Inc. v.

       In amending an arbitrator’s award to an insured under an underinsured motorist provision, the superior court erred in requiring the insurance carrier to pay additional prejudgment interest and attorney’s fees where the insured had elected to forgo payment of additional prejudgment interest and attorney’s fees on the settlement amount she had received from the driver’s insurer.

       In a dispute regarding whether the real estate sold with a car dealership was contaminated, attorney’s fees and costs were properly awarded during the process of confirming the arbitrator’s award because the award involved costs incurred only in the proceedings before the superior court and did not involve the costs of arbitration; the award fell entirely outside the scope of the arbitrator’s award.

        Arbitrability. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       When a sub-subcontractor asserted a claim against a general contractor for nonpayment by a subcontractor, a court had to decide whether the claim was arbitrable under the general contractor’s arbitration agreement, because, when disputes were arbitrable at the general contractor’s sole discretion, the question of arbitrability was not merely a procedural prerequisite to arbitration. GeoTek Alaska, Inc. v. Jacobs Eng'g Group, Inc., 354 P.3d 368 (Alaska 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the arbitration panel exceeded the scope of its authority in awarding prejudgment interest, the superior court was required to apply its independent judgment to the issue; it therefore was error to afford any deference to the arbitration panel's "arguably questionable" analysis. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Harbour, 491 P.3d 374 (Alaska 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the parties did not delegate to the arbitration panels the authority to resolve questions of arbitrability, the arbitration panels were bound by applicable law in determining the scope of their authority. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Harbour, 491 P.3d 374 (Alaska 2021).

       Party to arbitration can waive objections to the arbitrator's authority by failing to raise them in a timely manner; the waiver rule is compatible with the relevant provisions of the Alaska Revised Uniform Arbitration Act, and a party objecting to an arbitrator's authority bears the burden of presenting a timely objection in arbitration or in court and that failure to do so may result in forfeiture of the objection on appeal.

       Party to arbitration can waive objections to the arbitrator's authority by failing to raise them in a timely manner; the waiver rule is compatible with the relevant provisions of the Alaska Revised Uniform Arbitration Act, and a party objecting to an arbitrator's authority bears the burden of presenting a timely objection in arbitration or in court and that failure to do so may result in forfeiture of the objection on appeal.

       An arbitration award was improperly vacated because the arbitrator’s interpretation of the dispute was reasonable, and supported by the expansive arbitration clause in the employment agreement, the employee’s broad claim for breach of contract in his statement of claims, and the full evidence submitted to the arbitrator.

      <p>
       Party to arbitration can waive objections to the arbitrator's authority by failing to raise them in a timely manner; the waiver rule is compatible with the relevant provisions of the Alaska Revised Uniform Arbitration Act, and a party objecting to an arbitrator's authority bears the burden of presenting a timely objection in arbitration or in court and that failure to do so may result in forfeiture of the objection on appeal. Lee v. Sheldon, 427 P.3d 745 (Alaska 2018).

       </p>
       <p>
        When the estate or interest to be protected is equitable, the jurisdiction should be exercised, whether the plaintiff is in or out of possession, for under these circumstances legal remedies are not possible; but, when the estate or interest is legal in its nature, the exercise of the jurisdiction depends upon the adequacy of legal remedies.
        Thus, for example, a plaintiff out of possession, holding the legal title, will be left to his remedy by ejectment. Where, on the other hand, a party out of possession has an equitable title, or where he holds the legal title under circumstances that the law cannot furnish him full and complete relief, his resort to equity to have a cloud removed ought not to be questioned. Buckley v. Verhonic, 8 Alaska 429 (D. Alaska 1933).

       <p>
        A complaint in a quiet title action contained the essential allegations where the plaintiff alleged in substance that: (1) He was the owner of the premises in question; (2) he was in possession; (3) defendant claimed an interest in the property; and (4) the claimed interests of the defendant were adverse to the plaintiff’s interest and were without right.
        These allegations were followed by a prayer that the court determine the adverse interests of the defendant, hold them for naught and forever bar the defendant from asserting any claim in the premises adverse to the plaintiff. Davis v. Tant, 361 P.2d 763 (Alaska 1961). See United States v. North-West Trading Co., 1 Alaska 5 (D. Alaska 1888).

         Waiver of objection to equitable jurisdiction. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the allegations of plaintiff’s complaint showed the action to be equitable, the defendants’ denial of possession on the part of the plaintiff could not oust the court of equity of jurisdiction, and when the defendants not only joined issue with the plaintiff touching the equitable cause as pleaded, but set up a like cause, and prayed equitable relief, and at the same time interposed one or more equitable defenses, they waived their objection to the equitable jurisdiction and could not be heard to insist upon the legal remedy. Pacific Coal &amp; Transp. Co. v. Pioneer Mining Co., 205 F. 577, 4 Alaska Fed. 115 (9th Cir. Alaska 1913).

         No right to jury trial under this section. —

       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff is in possession and the defendant is not, the cause being equitable, neither party is in a position to invoke the constitutional provisions regarding trial by jury in civil cases, because the suit is not one at common law, and the plaintiff is without a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law. Pacific Coal &amp; Transp. Co. v. Pioneer Mining Co., 205 F. 577, 4 Alaska Fed. 115 (9th Cir. Alaska 1913).

         Answer asserting possession by defendants only raises question of law. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        By an allegation by defendants of their possession at the time the action was brought, only the question of jurisdiction is raised, which is a question of law for the court to decide and not a question of fact in ejectment for the jury. Elbing v. Hastings, 3 Alaska 125 (D. Alaska 1906).

       <p>
        If the answer is only in the nature of a plea in abatement, and the defendants allege and rely upon possession of the property at the time plaintiffs brought their suit in equity, that question is not one to be submitted to a jury, but goes to a failure of proof to sustain the bill.
        It is a question of jurisdiction, and must be answered by the court upon hearing the testimony. Elbing v. Hastings, 3 Alaska 125 (D. Alaska 1906).

       <p>
        One in possession merely, without legal or equitable title, cannot maintain a suit to quiet title or to remove a cloud therefrom. Ripinsky v. Hinchman, 181 F. 786, 3 Alaska Fed. 496 (9th Cir. Alaska 1910), modified, 186 F. 151, 3 Alaska Fed. 571 (9th Cir. 1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        The very idea of removing a cloud from title presupposes that the plaintiff has a title of some order to defend or to relieve of an alleged or threatened encumbrance or cloud. Ripinsky v. Hinchman, 181 F. 786, 3 Alaska Fed. 496 (9th Cir. Alaska 1910), modified, 186 F. 151, 3 Alaska Fed. 571 (9th Cir. 1911).

        In a suit to quiet title or to remove a cloud the plaintiff must succeed upon the strength of his own title and not on the weakness of that of his adversary. Ripinsky v. Hinchman, 181 F. 786, 3 Alaska Fed. 496 (9th Cir. Alaska 1910), modified, 186 F. 151, 3 Alaska Fed. 571 (9th Cir. 1911).

         A valid location of a mining claim, accompanied by possession,

        One who first makes a valid location of a mining claim and enters into its possession acquires a title thereto, not the legal title, which remains in the United States until conveyed by it, but such a title as the laws of the United States recognize and will protect, as against an intruder.

        Under this section it is necessary that the complaint allege that the plaintiff is in possession of the property, for if the plaintiff were not in possession, he would have a plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law by an action in ejectment. Davis v. Tant, 361 P.2d 763 (Alaska 1961); Shope v. Sims, 658 P.2d 1336 (Alaska 1983).

       <p>
        It is incumbent upon the plaintiff, in order to maintain an action under this section, to show actual possession of the land in controversy, or some part thereof, at the date of the commencement of the action. Lange v. Robinson, 148 F. 799, 2 Alaska Fed. 650 (9th Cir. Alaska 1906).

        Where, in a suit to quiet title under this section, the defendants by their answer plead, and the court finds, that defendants were in possession of the property at the time of bringing the action, the suit must be dismissed for failure of proof, for want of jurisdiction in equity, and because the plaintiffs would have a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law under AS

        Where plaintiff is not in possession and defendant is, a suit to quiet title is not within the jurisdiction of a court of equity, where other relief as well is sought.
        This is true even though a number of additional reliefs are prayed for, part of which may be included within the jurisdiction of equity. Johnston v. Corson Gold Mining Co., 157 F. 145, 2 Alaska Fed. 853 (9th Cir. Alaska 1907).

        If the ground covered by the plaintiff’s mining claims was unappropriated public domain at the time of the making of his locations, then the location of said claims and the doing of assessment work thereon, if such work was done, would be sufficient possession for the plaintiff to maintain an action under this section. Francis v. Jenkins, 9 Alaska 91 (D. Alaska 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, a plaintiff must allege that he or she was in possession, which, for an unpatented mining claim, is evidenced by location and the performance of annual assessment work. Shope v. Sims, 658 P.2d 1336 (Alaska 1983).

        If the ground covered by the plaintiff’s claim was appropriated ground, segregated from the public domain, by prior valid and subsisting locations, then his locations would be void as far as they conflicted with the defendant’s claims and would not give the plaintiff sufficient possession to maintain the action. Francis v. Jenkins, 9 Alaska 91 (D. Alaska 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the ownership of a claim had been determined in a prior action between the parties in which the defendant was adjudged to be the owner of the claim, which was a valid and subsisting claim at the time the plaintiff located or attempted to locate his claim, there never was a valid location by the plaintiff; therefore, plaintiff did not have even constructive possession of the same when he brought an action to quiet title under this section.

         Public policies served by adverse possession statutes. —

       </p>
       <p>
        The public policies underlying the law of adverse possession exist because of a belief that title to land should not long be in doubt, that society will benefit from someone’s making use of land left idle, and that third persons who regard the occupant as owner may be protected. Alaska Nat'l Bank v. Linck, 559 P.2d 1049 (Alaska 1977).

         Concepts underlying law of adverse possession. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The three adjectives in this section used to describe the requirements of adverse possession, “uninterrupted,” “adverse” and “notorious,” represent the three concepts underlying the law of adverse possession: (1) The possession must have been continuous and uninterrupted; (2) the possessor must have acted as if he were the owner and not merely one acting with the permission of the owner; and (3) the possession must have been reasonably visible to the record owner. Alaska Nat'l Bank v. Linck, 559 P.2d 1049 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The three basic requirements for adverse possession are: (1) the possession must have been continuous and uninterrupted; (2) the possessor must have acted as if he were the owner and not merely one acting with the permission of the owner; and (3) the possession must have been reasonably visible to the record owner. Shilts v. Young, 567 P.2d 769 (Alaska 1977); Walsh v. Emerick, 611 P.2d 28 (Alaska 1980).

         Purpose of adverse possession requirements. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        From the standpoint of the true owner, the purpose of the various requirements of adverse possession — that the nonpermissive use be actual, open, notorious, continuous, exclusive, and hostile — is to put him on notice of the hostile nature of the possession so that he, the owner, may take steps to vindicate his rights by legal action. Shilts v. Young, 567 P.2d 769 (Alaska 1977); Walsh v. Emerick, 611 P.2d 28 (Alaska 1980).

       <p>
        Property owner's adjoining neighbor adversely possessed a portion of the owner's land by building a shed on the land because the neighbor regularly graveled and parked vehicles in the area, the neighbor's activities on the area were sufficient to constitute adverse possession, and the court adequately defined the area adversely possessed by referencing landmarks. Furthermore, the good faith but mistaken belief statutorily required for adverse possession required only subjective good faith on the part of the neighbor. Hurd v. Henley, 478 P.3d 208 (Alaska 2020).

        Where the answer in an ejectment action failed to allege that the possession so relied upon was adverse or under claim of title, and went no further than to say that the possession was actual, open, notorious, and exclusive, and that defendant and his grantors had been the actual owners of the premises during all of the time, such allegations fall short of showing the adverse possession which is made a defense by this section.

        Where defendant claimed under a quitclaim deed and took possession of at least a part of the land in controversy under the deed, this was sufficient to give color of title, although there was no showing that the grantor claimed any interest in the property at the date of the execution of the deed.

        While it seems clear that the taking of successive possessions is sufficient to constitute one continuous adverse possession for the statutory period, the mere naked continuance in possession over a long period by several persons will not constitute title by adverse possession, unless that title is under color or claim of title during the entire period.

        The nature of possession sufficient to meet the requirement that the possession be continuous and uninterrupted for the statutary period depends on the character of the property.

       </p>

        Unless the true owner has actual knowledge of the hostile claim, it is essential to the acquisition of title by prescription or adverse possession that the possession be open, visible, public, and notorious.

       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement that the possession must have been reasonably visible to the record owner is “notorious” possession so that if the owner visits the property, he would be put on notice and be able to assert his rights. Shilts v. Young, 567 P.2d 769 (Alaska 1977).

       </p>
       <p>

       There must be at least apparent violence, or some unusual weapons, or the parties attended with an unusual number of people, some menaces or other acts giving reasonable cause to fear that the party making the forcible entry will do some bodily hurt to those in possession if they do not give up the same.

      <p>
       Where defendant entered peaceably and without force, with the consent and under the title of a prior claimant, the homestead entryman, and entered under an adverse claim of title, and without admitting the title or possession of the plaintiff, under such facts he cannot be summarily removed by the forcible entry and detainer act, but is entitled to have his title tried at law. Steil v. Dessmore, 3 Alaska 392 (D. Alaska 1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is well-settled that where title to the property is in dispute, dispossession by the summary procedure of a suit for forcible detainer may not be ordered.
       Instead, the plaintiff must establish his paramount title in an action for ejectment. Modrok v. Marshall, 523 P.2d 172 (Alaska 1974).

      To authorize an action against a tenant or person in possession who has paid rent in advance, a notice must be given at least 10 days before the date the rent is due again in case of a month-to-month tenancy or at least three days before in the case of a week-to-week tenancy.

    <p>
     “Common law liens at law” and “claims of common law” which are filed in connection with lawsuits unrelated to the title or right to possession of real property are not legally effective for any purpose whatsoever. Such documents may not legally be recorded and the recorder should not record these documents. Since common law liens that were mistakenly recorded by the recorder’s office were unauthorized documents which should not have been recorded, their recording does not give constructive notice of their contents to anyone and the recordation of those unauthorized documents is void and of no legal effect. March 24, 1980, Op. Att’y Gen.

     <p>
      A person having a lien upon real property, other than that of a judgment, whether created by mortgage or otherwise, to secure a debt or other obligation may bring an action to foreclose the lien.
      In the action, the court may direct the sale of the encumbered property or a portion of it and the application of the proceeds of the sale to the payment of costs, expenses of sale, and the amount due the plaintiff. The judgment shall also determine the personal liability of a defendant for the payment of the debt secured by the lien and be entered accordingly.

        Section applies to nuisance not strictly private. —

      </p>
      <p>
       No reason is apparent to restrict the meaning of this section to a nuisance strictly private and in no sense public.
       If the word “nuisance” had been used in this section instead of the words “private nuisance,” it would have changed the common-law rule that a party suing on account of a public nuisance must show an injury different in kind and not in degree from that sustained by the general public before he can prevail. It was doubtless to preserve the common law in this respect and to avoid uncertainty that the words “private nuisance” were used. Snyder v. Kelter, 4 Alaska 447 (D. Alaska 1912).

        City may compel removal of obstruction from street. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The great weight of authority favors the right of a municipal corporation to enjoin and compel the removal of an obstruction in a city street. City of Anchorage v. Fowler, 6 Alaska 470 (D. Alaska 1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       The general rule is that a municipality may sue to enjoin the continuance of, and abate, a permanent obstruction in a street or alley, and it is immaterial that the encroachment is prohibited by an ordinance imposing a penalty for violation thereof, or that the city may remove such obstructions. City of Anchorage v. Fowler, 6 Alaska 470 (D. Alaska 1922).

        Suit in equity is appropriate remedy. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The appropriate way, even where an abutting owner claims to be entitled to maintain an obstruction on a street, is for the municipality to sue in equity to restrain him from maintaining, and to compel him to remove, the obstruction. City of Anchorage v. Fowler, 6 Alaska 470 (D. Alaska 1922).

        Clear showing of injury is necessary for temporary injunction. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Before a temporary injunction will issue, it must not only clearly appear that a nuisance exists, but plaintiff’s right must be clearly established; that is, the necessary extent and character of her injury on account of the nuisance, and a mere preponderance of the evidence as upon final trial, is not sufficient.

       There may be cases so imperatively demanding immediately relief as to require the aid of a court of equity to avoid irreparable injury, but to call into action this extraordinary power, the right of the plaintiff must be clear, and his conduct made to clearly appear entirely equitable.

An agricultural facility or an agricultural operation at an agricultural facility is not a private nuisance if the governing body of the local soil and water conservation district advises the commissioner in writing that the facility or operation is consistent with a soil conservation plan developed and implemented in cooperation with the district.

       Farmer was not shielded from nuisance liability because odors emanating from the farmer's storage of septage on the farmer's farmland created a private nuisance to adjacent landowners because the farmer was not engaged in commercial agricultural operations, but was actually using the farm's septage lagoons to store septage from the farmer's separate septic pumping and storing business.

      If judgment is in favor of the plaintiff, an order may issue at any time within six months of the date of the judgment at plaintiff’s request directing the issuance of a warrant to a peace officer to abate the nuisance.

      At any time before the order is made, the defendant may apply to the court for an order to stay the issuance of the warrant for a period not exceeding six months to allow the defendant to abate the nuisance.
      The court may grant the stay if the defendant gives an undertaking to the plaintiff in a sufficient amount and with satisfactory sureties that the issuance will be abated within the time and in the manner specified in the order.
      If the defendant fails to abate the nuisance within the time specified, an order directing the issuance of the warrant for the abatement of the nuisance may be made.

      <p>
       Because a new reasonable use rule was announced by the Supreme Court of Alaska for the unreasonable interference with riparian or littoral rights, the superior court, on remand, was to conduct the proper legal analysis to determine whether lake front property owners' use unreasonably interfered with their neighbors' use before the court determined whether the dock built by the owners constituted a private nuisance.

       Where several neighbors started a large fire to clear rubbish, and the fire caused damage to appellant’s property and business, appellant sued for damages; superior court erred by dismissing appellee’s counterclaims that appellant’s operation of a dog boarding business and drug business on his property constituted a nuisance as defined in this section, as a kennel of barking dogs and the alleged marijuana business could constitute a private nuisance.

      When several persons own real property as tenants in common, in which one or more of them have an estate of inheritance or for life or years, or when real property is subject to a life estate with remainder over, an action may be brought by one or more of those persons or by the life tenant for a portion of it according to the respective rights of the interested persons, and for a sale of the property or a part of it if it appears that a partition cannot be had without great prejudice to the parties.

       Mining property, from its very nature is not, as a rule, susceptible of division, and consequently partition of such property must generally result in its sale. Manley v. Boone, 159 F. 633, 3 Alaska Fed. 10 (9th Cir. Alaska 1908).

       While this section gives to the partition by shares the preference, yet a mining claim is a property whose value lies hidden beneath the ground to such an extent that generally it cannot be divided on the surface, but must be sold.
       But where its hidden wealth is explored and so ascertained as to be capable of location and fair partition by shares, the rule permits it to be done that way, and the statute requires it.

        The first essential in the initiation of rights by an original placer location is that the ground upon which the location is made is situated on the public domain; i.e., that the ground is open, unoccupied land of the United States, and that it has not already been legally appropriated as mining ground by another.

      If, at any time before judgment, the lessee or a successor in interest pays the amount of rent in arrears with interest and costs of the action and performs the other covenants or agreements, the lessee or successor is entitled to continue in possession unless otherwise provided in the lease.

     <p>
      A person who without lawful authority cuts down, girdles, or otherwise injures or removes a tree, timber, or a shrub on (1) the land of another person or on the street or highway in front of a person’s house, or (2) a village or municipal lot, or cultivated grounds, or the commons or public land of a village or municipality, or (3) the street or highway in front of land described in (2) of this section, is liable to the owner of that land, or to the village or municipality for treble the amount of damages that may be assessed in a civil action. However, if the trespass was unintentional or involuntary, or the defendant had probable cause to believe that the land on which the trespass was committed was the defendant’s own or that of the person in whose service or by whose direction the act was done, or where the timber was taken from unenclosed woodland for the purpose of repairing a public highway or bridge on or adjoining the land, only actual damages may be recovered.

       In action arising out of automobile accident, the trial court’s refusal to take judicial notice of or instruct the jury on this section was not error since it was not applicable to the controversy and any instruction would tend to mislead, confuse, or divert the jury.

      <p>
       The damages that are to be trebled under this section represent not merely the value of the timber cut but damages to the freehold as well. Andersen v. Edwards, 625 P.2d 282 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The damages awarded reflect in part the value of the timber taken and in part the cost of restoring the land to a condition of usefulness. Andersen v. Edwards, 625 P.2d 282 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ordinarily, a landowner damaged by a trespass may recover either the loss in property value or reasonable restoration costs, but restoration costs are inappropriate if they are disproportionate to the loss in property value, unless there is a reason personal to the landowner for restoring the land. Chung v. Park, 339 P.3d 351 (Alaska 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Amount of damages that could be assessed in a civil action in this case, as determined by case law, was the diminution in the market value of the owner’s property, but the evidence showed the removal of trees did not appreciably affect the value of the property; nothing in the statute provides a basis for awarding restoration damages when such damages would not otherwise be appropriate.

       No fault could be apportioned in a timber trespass suit to a neighboring owner who had given other neighbors permission to remove trees from her land because she had no duty to investigate and disclose the boundaries of her property in the absence of a business transaction; moreover, there was no evidence that she had intentionally caused the removal of a large number of trees beyond the boundary line, which was unforeseeable.

       To entitle the plaintiff to recover treble damages, judgment therefor must be demanded in the complaint, so that the defendant may be apprised of the claim, and the facts stated in the complaint must bring the case within this section. McQuillan v. Tanana Elec. Co., 3 Alaska 110 (D. Alaska 1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a general rule that, in an action to recover treble damages under a statute, the demand for such damages must be expressly inserted in the declaration, and reference should be made to the act. Duffy v. Strandberg, 5 Alaska 353 (D. Alaska 1915).

        The defense against a claim for treble damages must be pleaded,

       and it may be either: (1) That the trespass was casual or involuntary; (2) that, at the time of the commission thereof, the defendant had probable cause to believe the premises were his own or those of the person under whom he acted; or (3) that the timber was taken from unenclosed woodland for the purpose of repairing a highway or bridge.

      <p>
       Removal of trees from the owner’s property did not appreciably affect the value of her property, and thus the treble damages awarded were clearly disproportionate to the diminution of the property value; the superior court could have awarded restoration damages only if it had found that the owner had a reason personal for restoring her property, but the superior court expressly found that she did not prove this and she did not challenge this finding, and thus awarding compensatory damages that exceeded the diminution in the market value of the property was not appropriate. Chung v. Park, 339 P.3d 351 (Alaska 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Punitive damages were not available when the owners of an adjacent lot sued a property owner after the owner without prior approval cut down trees on the owner's lot that were protected by the subdivision's declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions because the owner did not commit trespass to trees as the trees which the owner cut were on the owner's property.

        “Casual” negligence

      “Common law liens at law” and “claims of common law” which are filed in connection with lawsuits unrelated to the title or right to possession of real property are not legally effective for any purpose whatsoever. Such documents may not legally be recorded and the recorder should not record these documents. Since common law liens which were mistakenly recorded by the recorder’s office were unauthorized documents which should not have been recorded, their recording does not give constructive notice of their contents to anyone and the recordation of those unauthorized documents is void and of no legal effect.

       The common law doctrine of lis pendens has not been altered by the enactment of this section.

       It would be anomalous to hold that a litigant is privileged to make a publication necessary to bring an action but that he can be sued for defamation if he lets anyone know that he has brought it, particularly when he is expressly authorized by statute to let all the world know that he has brought it.

      <p>
       While this section does not expressly provide for expunction of a lis pendens, it has been interpreted as providing that a filed notice of lis pendens may be cancelled due to noncompliance with the requirements.
       A lis pendens was properly expunged where the action did not directly affect the title to or right of possession of real property or seek an equitable lien on the specific property. Blake v. Gilbert, 702 P.2d 631 (Alaska 1985), overruled, Bibo v. Jeffrey's Restaurant, 770 P.2d 290 (Alaska 1989).

       It was not error to expunge a landowner’s lis pendens because the landowner showed no legally cognizable connection between the landowner’s suit and real property owned by any individual defendants. Gladden v. City of Dillingham, — P.3d — (Alaska Oct. 1, 2014) (memorandum decision).

       When a deceased husband granted his girlfriend a deed of trust on the family home and the girlfriend’s caretaker recorded a notice of lis pendens on the home, it was not error to vacate the notice of lis pendens because the notice was no longer effective 30 days after the caretaker’s federal lawsuit was dismissed.

         Origin. —

         History of contempt. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The distinction between criminal and civil contempt has been traced at least as far back as the 18th century, and appears to have become firmly established by the late 19th century. Johansen v. State, 491 P.2d 759 (Alaska 1971); State v. Browder, 486 P.2d 925 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contempt was originally regarded as a crime, punishable by criminal sanctions.
        Whether this was because the original law of contempt embraced only what is now known of as criminal contempt, or because every contempt inevitably contains an element of disrespect for the authority of government (one of the hallmarks of criminal contempt) is not clear.
        It is certain, however, that the genesis of modern day contempt was a crime. Johansen v. State, 491 P.2d 759 (Alaska 1971).

         Power of court. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts of justice have an inherent power to punish all persons for contempt of their rules and orders, for disobedience of their process, and for disturbing them in their proceedings. In re Atkins, 5 Alaska 20 (D. Alaska 1887).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power to punish for contempt is the highest exercise of judicial power, and is not an incident to the mere exercise of judicial functions; such power cannot be upheld upon inferences and implications, but must be expressly conferred by law. United States v. Pratt, 3 Alaska 400 (D. Alaska 1907), aff'd, Leber v. United States, 170 F. 881, 3 Alaska Fed. 366 (9th Cir. Alaska 1909).

         Legislative limitations on court contempt powers. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In Alaska, unlike the federal system applicable to United States district courts and courts of appeal, the supreme and superior courts were created by the Alaska Constitution and not by legislative enactment.
        Thus, statutory enactments which endeavor to limit the necessary contempt powers of the Alaska superior and supreme courts are not binding. Continental Ins. Cos. v. Bayless &amp; Roberts, 548 P.2d 398 (Alaska 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Enactments endeavoring to restrict the court’s contempt powers are entitled to respect as an opinion of a coordinate branch of the government but are not binding on the court.
        An exception to this rule pertains to courts created by legislative enactment.
        There the legislature does have the power to limit the court’s exercise of contempt procedures. Continental Ins. Cos. v. Bayless &amp; Roberts, 548 P.2d 398 (Alaska 1976).

        <b>
         When statutes regulating contempt power should be given effect. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory enactments that reasonably regulate the contempt power, as representing the opinion of a coequal branch of the government, should be given effect as a matter of comity unless they fetter the efficient operation of the courts or impair their ability to uphold their dignity and authority. Continental Ins. Cos. v. Bayless &amp; Roberts, 548 P.2d 398 (Alaska 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the superior court awarded costs and expenses to the plaintiff and further ordered the defendant insurance company held in contempt for failure to respond to certain interrogatories within 10 days or suffer default, where the interrogatories were answered within the time required, and there was no necessity for the court to invoke its inherent powers, under these circumstances, that court should give comity to the legislative enactments and limit its power to the remedies specified therein. Continental Ins. Cos. v. Bayless &amp; Roberts, 548 P.2d 398 (Alaska 1976).

        The inherent power of the court to punish for contempt, whether direct or indirect, is limited to those situations when it is necessary to preserve the dignity, decorum, and efficiency of the court. Continental Ins. Cos. v. Bayless &amp; Roberts, 548 P.2d 398 (Alaska 1976).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where a court is without jurisdiction to compel a witness to appear and testify on deposition, a conviction for contempt for such refusal is illegal and void, and the prisoner will be entitled to be discharged on habeas corpus. United States v. Pratt, 3 Alaska 400 (D. Alaska 1907), aff'd, Leber v. United States, 170 F. 881, 3 Alaska Fed. 366 (9th Cir. Alaska 1909).

        A notary public sitting as an examiner to take the deposition of a witness in Alaska is not a court, and has no power to punish a witness who disobeys a subpoena to appear and give testimony, but should report such disobedience to the court wherein the action, suit, or proceeding is pending.

         Two classes of proceedings. —

       </p>
       <p>
        Proceedings for contempt are of two classes, those prosecuted to preserve the power and vindicate the dignity of the courts and to punish for disobedience of their orders, and those instituted to preserve and enforce the rights of private parties to suits and to compel obedience to orders and decrees made for enforcing the rights and administering the remedies to which the court has found them to be entitled. The former are criminal and punitive in nature and the government, the courts, and the people are interested in their prosecution. The latter are civil, remedial, and coercive in nature, and the parties chiefly in interest as to their conduct and prosecution are the individuals whose private rights and remedies they were instituted to enforce. United States ex rel. Noyes v. Wood, 6 Alaska 255 (D. Alaska 1920).

        In order to be perjury, the matter which is falsely given must be material to the matter before the court, and to be contempt there must be the element of obstruction of the court in the administration of justice. United States v. Talbot, 133 F. Supp. 120, 15 Alaska 590 (D. Alaska 1955).

         Disobedience of a lawful order of the court

        connotes more than the mere failure to comply with such order.
        The word “disobey” has the connotation of willfully failing to comply, without some lawful or reasonable excuse for not complying.
        If such an excuse does exist and it is estabished, there can be no contempt of the authority of the court. Johansen v. State, 491 P.2d 759 (Alaska 1971).

       <p>
        Before a party may be held in criminal or civil contempt for failure to abide by a court order, certain elements must be established: (1) the existence of a valid order directing the alleged contemnor to do or refrain from doing something and the court’s jurisdiction to enter that order; (2) the contemnor’s notice of the order within sufficient time to comply with it; (3) in most cases, the contemnor’s ability to comply with the order; and (4) the contemnor’s willful failure to comply with the order.

        An act of contempt is “done voluntarily and intentionally, that is, with the intent to disobey or disregard the law.” Gwynn v. Gwynn, 530 P.2d 1311 (Alaska 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        An intentional or willful failure to comply with an order occurs when such failure is not due to inability, but to purposefulness, bad faith, or fault of petitioner as distinguished from accidental, inadvertent, or negligent conduct. Continental Ins. Cos. v. Bayless &amp; Roberts, 548 P.2d 398 (Alaska 1976).

        If it is proved that a party had notice of the court’s order and was aware of the requirements but failed to comply with the order, in the absence of explanation of the reason for such failure, a court could infer it to be intentional.

        Civil contempt consists in failing to do something ordered to be done by a court in a civil action for the benefit of the opposing party. United States ex rel. Noyes v. Wood, 6 Alaska 255 (D. Alaska 1920).
       </p>
       <p>
        A civil contempt is said to be a willful failure to do something ordered by the court (or the doing of something forbidden by the court) for the benefit or advantage of another party to the proceeding before the court.
        Typically the contemnor is ordered to jail until he complies with the court’s order, or to pay a fine — sometimes to the aggrieved party — unless he complies.
        In this way, it is said that “he carries the keys to jail in his own pocket” — thus, he can purge himself. State v. Browder, 486 P.2d 925 (Alaska 1971).

        Where a jury panelist was held in contempt for leaving the courthouse during a recess and failing to return, and was sentenced to serve ninety hours of jury service, the contempt was criminal in nature, and the trial court erred in invoking its inherent power to punish the panelist because it did not give him notice that it was doing so or inform him that he was subject to a penalty greater than the statutory limit.

        The object of the ninth clause of this section was to invest the court with power to prevent interference with any and all proceedings taken in any action by the court or its duly authorized agencies acting in its behalf, and thereby to enable it the more efficiently to carry out its functions of doing justice in the trial and decision of causes pending before it.

       <p>
        It is necessary to determine whether the defendant has the ability to comply with the court order of support. At the outset, the trial judge should determine whether the alleged contemnor contests the assertion that he has the ability to satisfy the court’s order of child support. If the defendant makes no issue of his ability to comply, then he may be imprisoned, without intervention of a jury, to compel compliance with the order of support. On the other hand, if the defendant asserts that he lacks the ability to comply with the court’s order of child support, he is entitled to a jury trial on this issue. Johansen v. State, 491 P.2d 759 (Alaska 1971).

        In almost all child support contempt cases, the crucial issue will concern the defendant’s ability to comply. The burden of proof in this respect should remain with the defendant.
        This is where it presently rests, in this state and in other jurisdictions; such allocation of the burden of proof is appropriate. Johansen v. State, 491 P.2d 759 (Alaska 1971).

        Once he has met this burden, incarceration, as a coercive method, serves no useful purpose.

       <p>
        In nonsupport cases involving past willful flouting of the court’s authority, the court must announce at the outset that it will likely impose a criminal sanction if the defendant is found guilty of contempt, and provide attendant criminal procedural safeguards.
        If the court does not make such an announcement, a jury trial is still required, but criminal safeguards are unnecessary. Diggs v. Diggs, 663 P.2d 950 (Alaska 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the court does not announce its intent to impose a criminal sanction if defendant is found guilty of contempt, the court cannot impose a fixed jail term; any sanction which is imposed as a result of the civil contempt proceeding must afford a continuous opportunity to the defendant to purge the contempt.

        Superior court’s order requiring defendant in nonsupport proceeding to serve 90 days with 45 days suspended on certain conditions was vacated since the court did not announce at the outset of the proceeding that it intended to impose a criminal sanction if the defendant was found guilty of contempt and the preponderance of the evidence burdens of proof were used by the superior court in its instructions to the jury rather than the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.

        , only the following contempts are punishable by imprisonment: (1) disorderly, contemptuous, or insolent behavior toward the judge while holding the court, tending to impair its authority or to interrupt the course of a trial or other judicial proceeding; and (2) a breach of the peace, boisterous conduct, or violent disturbance, tending to interrupt the course of a trial or other judicial proceedings.
        These are the only contempts punishable by imprisonment, and therefore must be tried by jury. State v. Browder, 486 P.2d 925 (Alaska 1971).

       </p>
       <p>
        Being learned in the law and officers of the court, attorneys are presumed to know the necessity for loyalty to both, and to know the limit which separates duty from defiance and contempt. United States v. Pratt, 3 Alaska 400 (D. Alaska 1907), aff'd, Leber v. United States, 170 F. 881, 3 Alaska Fed. 366 (9th Cir. Alaska 1909).

       </p>
       <p>
        Intentional defiance of the process of the court, in bad faith and without honesty of purpose, is a contempt, and subjects an attorney, as well as a layman, to punishment. United States v. Pratt, 3 Alaska 400 (D. Alaska 1907), aff'd, Leber v. United States, 170 F. 881, 3 Alaska Fed. 366 (9th Cir. Alaska 1909).

        It would be an innovation in the law if an attorney were to be summarily punished for contempt whenever a statement made by him on behalf of his client, after investigation, turned out to be untrue. Paul v. United States, 36 F.2d 639, 5 Alaska Fed. 457 (9th Cir. Alaska 1929).

         Affidavit of prejudice is not proper basis of contempt although untrue. —

       </p>
       <p>
        Where an attorney filed a proper affidavit of prejudice and of interest, if the facts therein stated were untrue, the fact that they were untrue is not a proper basis for adjudging the attorney guilty of contempt. Paul v. United States, 36 F.2d 639, 5 Alaska Fed. 457 (9th Cir. Alaska 1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        An attorney may in a proper case, in a respectful manner, allege that the judge is prejudiced against his client, and unless the act is done with reckless disregard of truth, or with the express intention to reflect upon the honor and integrity of the judge, it is not a contempt.

        An attorney has the right to advise his client as to the validity of an order of court, or of a writ issued under its authority, which affects the client’s interests, and his advice to the effect that such order or writ is illegal and void, if given in good faith, will not render him liable for contempt, because of an error in judgment. United States v. Pratt, 3 Alaska 400 (D. Alaska 1907), aff'd, Leber v. United States, 170 F. 881, 3 Alaska Fed. 366 (9th Cir. Alaska 1909).

        An attorney is guilty of contempt if he goes beyond the right to advise in matters of law, and, actuated by a spirit of resistance, counsels or conspires with his client or others to disobey an order of court and obstruct its enforcement. United States v. Pratt, 3 Alaska 400 (D. Alaska 1907), aff'd, Leber v. United States, 170 F. 881, 3 Alaska Fed. 366 (9th Cir. Alaska 1909).

       The intention of the legislature, as disclosed by this article, was to suppress houses of lewdness and prostitution, and to prevent persons from maintaining or conducting such houses, either at the place where they were being maintained or at any other place throughout the judicial division; also to abate the nuisance then existing, by closing up the same for the period of one year.

       From a consideration of this article, it is apparent that it has a twofold application, namely, a personal injunction against setting up, maintaining, or conducting a nuisance of the character described, the injunction operating in futura, and the abatement of the building where the prescribed nuisance is being carried on.

      Hence, all employees on the Alaska ferry system who meet the classification of seamen or members of the crew within the scope of the Jones Act have an exclusive federal remedy within the terms of the Jones Act to the exclusion of the Alaska Workmen’s Compensation Act, except as to those injuries that occur in a situation of only local concern or fall within the “twilight zone” between local and federal jurisdiction. 1963 Alas.

         History of sovereign immunity doctrine. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Sovereign immunity sprang from the ancient motion that the King could do no wrong. The Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946 was seen as a comprehensive waiver of governmental immunity. The exception for discretionary functions has been read so broadly on occasion as to almost reinstate complete immunity. However, lower federal courts have not treated discretionary function problems consistently, with some following the rule that planning level decisions fall within the exception while operational ones do not. Other courts follow the rule that once discretion to do a particular act is exercised the act must be performed with reasonable care. State v. Abbott, 498 P.2d 712 (Alaska 1972); State v. Zia, Inc., 556 P.2d 1257 (Alaska 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The basic policy of the law
        </b>
        should be that when there is negligence, the rule is liability; immunity is the exception. State v. Abbott, 498 P.2d 712 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The reason for preserving sovereign immunity
        </b>
        for certain acts of the state is the necessity for judicial abstention in certain policy-making areas that have been committed to other branches of government. Carlson v. State, 598 P.2d 969 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The principal policy underlying tort immunity is to limit judicial reexamination of decisions properly entrusted to other branches of government; courts must not intrude into realms of policy exceeding their institutional competence. Industrial Indem. Co. v. State, 669 P.2d 561 (Alaska 1983).

        While the negligence standard satisfies the strong public policy favoring compensation of individuals injured by the tortious conduct of the state, it is an extremely flexible standard, and consequently will not inhibit the vigorous and effective performance by the state of its duties in the way that a more rigid standard might.
        Moreover, when the negligence standard is applied in conjunction with the policy-oriented interpretation of the discretionary function exception, the danger of excessive judicial interference with important decisions committed to the coordinate branches of government is avoided.

       There was no reason to continue the litigation of whether dismissal of a plaintiff’s 42 U.S.C.S. § 1981 claim violated the Supremacy Clause or the plaintiff’s constitutional right to a jury trial because state law was inapplicable to claims brought under § 1981, the attorney general made it absolutely clear that it would not certify individual state employee defendants on § 1981 claims, the disputed issue would not be repeated and would not evade future review.

       Section implies that the proceeding should be instituted by a governmental official. Alaska ex rel. Bowman v. Alaska Airlines, 108 F. Supp. 274, 14 Alaska 85 (D. Alaska 1952), rev'd, 206 F.2d 203, 14 Alaska 363 (9th Cir. Alaska 1953).

      <p>
       Where the proper state official refuses to proceed, a private party may bring the action upon his own relation, and in the name of the people. Alaska ex rel. Bowman v. Alaska Airlines, 108 F. Supp. 274, 14 Alaska 85 (D. Alaska 1952), rev'd, 206 F.2d 203, 14 Alaska 363 (9th Cir. Alaska 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only court which has entertained an action by a private party under this section or its predecessors allowed such action only upon a showing that the interest of the private party in the action outweighed the public interest and that demand upon the appropriate authority to institute action either had been made or would be futile.

      If a petition is presented by an interested person to a district judge or magistrate alleging that a designated person has disappeared and after diligent search cannot be found, and if it appears to the satisfaction of the judge or magistrate that the circumstances surrounding the disappearance afford reasonable grounds for the belief that the person has suffered death from accidental or other violent means, the judge or magistrate shall summon and impanel a jury of six qualified persons to inquire into the facts surrounding and the presumption to be raised from the disappearance.
      If no one submits a petition within 40 days, a judge or magistrate may submit the petition from personal knowledge of the case.

      If the jury by their unanimous verdict in writing find that sufficient evidence has been presented to them from which it fairly may be presumed that the missing person has met death, and if the judge or magistrate approves the finding, then, after a period of six months has elapsed, the person shall be presumed to be dead and the judge or magistrate shall enter an order to that effect. However, in cases where there is clear and convincing evidence of the presumed death the judge or magistrate may sooner enter the order.

      The state may use its condemnation powers for a state office complex to be constructed by, and leased from, a private developer. In order to insure that the leasing arrangement clearly qualifies as a public use, however, the department should enter into a long-term lease with the developer, and should not grant the developer any sort of purchase option at the conclusion of the lease term.

        Ordinarily the only questions to be considered by the courts in condemnation proceedings are: First, whether the petitioner has the power to exercise the right of eminent domain; second, whether the property itself is of a nature subject to condemnation; third, whether the property is being taken for a public or a private use; and fourth, whether the power is being used for taking an excessive amount of property.

       The rule is that for a chattel to become a fixture and be considered as real estate, three prerequisites must unite: There must be an annexation to the realty of something appurtenant thereto; the chattel must have adaptability or application as affixed to the use for which the real estate is appropriated; and there must be an intention of the party to make the chattel a permanent accession to the freehold. Intention, the third of the three factors said to comprise the general test for determining whether an object has become a fixture, refers to the intent of the parties that the object being introduced onto the realty become a permanent accession thereto.

       <b>
        Judicial review of necessity. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska is among the minority of jurisdictions which statutorily call for judicial inquiry into the question of necessity in eminent domain proceedings. ARCO Pipeline Co. v. 3.60 Acres, More or Less, 539 P.2d 64 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Judicial review is inappropriate to proceedings under declaration of taking. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The concept of judicial review embodied in Alaska’s general eminent domain statutes is inconsistent with, and inappropriate to, proceedings under a declaration of taking. ARCO Pipeline Co. v. 3.60 Acres, More or Less, 539 P.2d 64 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The question of necessity under a declaration of taking is not one for initial judicial consideration as in the case of other condemnation proceedings. ARCO Pipeline Co. v. 3.60 Acres, More or Less, 539 P.2d 64 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       For distinction between proceedings in condemnation under a declaration of taking and those under a complaint seeking condemnation and an order for possession, see ARCO Pipeline Co. v. 3.60 Acres, More or Less, 539 P.2d 64 (Alaska 1975).

        Pleading must plainly show authority and necessity for taking. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of eminent domain can only be exercised in behalf of a public use authorized by law, and in the taking of property necessary to such public use the complaint or petition in such proceedings must show plainly and affirmatively the existence of the statutory authority for the public use, and the necessity of the property for such use. Miocene Ditch Co. v. Lyng, 138 F. 544, 2 Alaska Fed. 445 (9th Cir. Alaska 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       An inference is not sufficient in eminent domain proceedings. There must be a clear, positive statement that the property sought to be condemned is necessary for a public use authorized by law, and supported by a statement of facts from which the court can see that the property is intended to be used for that purpose. Miocene Ditch Co. v. Lyng, 138 F. 544, 2 Alaska Fed. 445 (9th Cir. Alaska 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Authority and necessity must be found by court before condemnation. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section has been construed as requiring the court to find the use is authorized by law and the taking is necessary “before condemnation.” Bridges v. Alaska Hous. Auth., 349 P.2d 149 (Alaska 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Necessity of findings. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is upon findings made in accordance with this section that there is established a basis for further proceedings.
       The findings constitute the decision of the court upon the vital question of whether or not the property sought to be taken can be condemned at all. Van Dyke v. Midnight Sun Mining &amp; Ditch Co., 177 F. 85, 3 Alaska Fed. 458 (9th Cir. Alaska 1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Questions to be considered by court. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Ordinarily the only questions to be considered by the courts in condemnation proceedings are: First, whether the petitioner has the power to exercise the right of eminent domain; second, whether the property itself is of a nature subject to condemnation; third, whether the property is being taken for a public or a private use; and fourth, whether the power is being used for taking an excessive amount of property. Town of Seward v. Margules, 9 Alaska 354 (D. Alaska 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Absolute necessity not required. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the condemnor may have the burden of making a prima facie showing of necessity, the language of this section ought to be construed to require no more than that the particular taking be shown to be “reasonably requisite and proper for the accomplishment of the purpose for which it is sought.” City of Fairbanks v. Metro Co., 540 P.2d 1056 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Particular questions left to discretion of condemning authority. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In general condemnation proceedings under this article, once the condemnor has presented sufficient evidence to support a finding that a particular taking is “reasonably requisite” for the effectuation of the authorized public purpose for which it is sought, particular questions as to the route, location, or amount of property to be taken are to be left to the sound discretion of the condemning authority absent a showing by clear and convincing evidence that such determinations are the product of fraud, caprice or arbitrariness. City of Fairbanks v. Metro Co., 540 P.2d 1056 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Burden of proof. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       One seeking to show that a particular taking is excessive or arbitrary has a heavy burden of proof in the attempt to persuade the court to substitute its judgment for that of the condemnor. City of Fairbanks v. Metro Co., 540 P.2d 1056 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Relative private injury. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       That certain property owners suffer relatively greater injury than others, or are less directly benefited by the project, does not establish that the taking of their property is unnecessarily injurious or unwarranted. City of Fairbanks v. Metro Co., 540 P.2d 1056 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       While it is true that the inability of a particular condemnee to obtain immediate beneficial use from the project may be considered as a factor in weighing the project’s impact in terms of the degree of private injury involved in a proposed route or location, the interest in minimizing private injury is not absolute and must always be weighed in relation to the goals and efficacy of the project in its entirety at the time such determinations are made. City of Fairbanks v. Metro Co., 540 P.2d 1056 (Alaska 1975).

       Where a complaint used the words “imperatively required” for a public use and alleged facts supporting the same, this was sufficient to show necessity under this section. Town of Seward v. Margules, 9 Alaska 354 (D. Alaska 1938).

The platting authority may establish applicable review procedures and standards for a replat made for the purpose of a right-of-way acquisition or condemnation. Neither the adequacy of the municipal replat process or standards, if any, nor the failure of a municipality to follow its own replat process and standards shall deprive the state of the authority to exercise its power of eminent domain. Final approval of replat shall also be obtained. However, if a state agency clearly demonstrates an overriding state interest, a waiver of the municipal approval requirements in this section may be granted by the governor.

        “Fair market value,” or the price a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for property, is the appropriate measure of “just compensation.” State v. Alaska Continental Dev. Corp., 630 P.2d 977 (Alaska 1980). See also Gackstetter v. State, 618 P.2d 564 (Alaska 1980).

         Value-to-the-taker is not an appropriate measure
        </b>
        of just compensation where residential property was taken, even though fill and gravel from the property was utilized by the condemnor. Gackstetter v. State, 618 P.2d 564 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employment of the fair market value test where the property contained dirt and gravel fill which was removed by the condemnor and used elsewhere in the project to its benefit does not preclude the owners from receiving just compensation.
        It is a basic tenet of eminent domain law that just compensation is determined by what the owner has lost and not by what the condemnor has gained. Gackstetter v. State, 618 P.2d 564 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the state appropriated residential property for which the owners were justly compensated through employment of a fair market valuation measure, the superior court did not err in its determination that consideration of value to the state of the fill and gravel received from the land was an inappropriate measure of just compensation.

       </p>
       <p>
        One criterion for determining value is what the property is worth on the market—its fair market value— and this is to be determined by a just consideration of all the uses for which a property is suitable. Dash v. State, 491 P.2d 1069 (Alaska 1971).

        Where a taking has occurred and the issue is the awarding of just compensation, such compensation may be determined in an inverse condemnation action using so far as is practicable the statutory requirements and procedural steps set out for eminent domain proceedings.

         A truly speculative or imagined use should not be considered.

         Evidence of use as subdivision. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The majority of courts allow evidence of a potential subdivision only for the limited purpose of showing the adaptability of the land for subdivision purposes. Dash v. State, 491 P.2d 1069 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The courts are much more liberal in admitting evidence of a potential subdivision when some preliminary steps have been taken to develop the land. Dash v. State, 491 P.2d 1069 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is testimony that the highest and best use of the property is as an industrial subdivision, and evidence that other property in the immediate area was subdivided for industrial purposes, the proposed subdivision is not purely conjectural or speculative. Dash v. State, 491 P.2d 1069 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the land were adaptable for subdivision purposes, it would seem that the potential income to be derived from sales of the subdivided lots would be highly relevant to a determination of the “market value,” especially to the extent that sophisticated investors who make decisions on the basis of income capitalization take part in market transactions. Dash v. State, 491 P.2d 1069 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Capitalization of income,
        </b>
        in contexts other than proposed subdivisions, has been recognized as an accepted method of valuation by a number of jurisdictions.
        Although capitalization of anticipated proceeds from a proposed subdivision necessarily has a speculative element, it still has a direct impact on the property’s market value since it will influence investment decisions and thereby affect supply and demand. Dash v. State, 491 P.2d 1069 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        To the extent that the “just compensation” guarantee in Alaska Const., art. I, § 18, comprises a notion of fair market value rather than merely the price the property will bring in an imperfect market, income capitalization must be considered particularly apposite. Dash v. State, 491 P.2d 1069 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even in a market place where a parcel’s price is unaffected by its income potential, income capitalization must be considered to have a bearing on “market value.”
        The danger that market price will not closely reflect market value is enhanced when the property is not currently generating income. Dash v. State, 491 P.2d 1069 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        An expert’s testimony which capitalized the anticipated rentals from a proposed recreational subdivision to arrive at an estimate of fair market value was properly admitted. Dash v. State, 491 P.2d 1069 (Alaska 1971).

        The assessment of damages the award of the commissioners (master) provided for in this section is made with reference to property sought to be appropriated or “portion sought to be condemned,” not to property already condemned at the time of the appointment. Alaska Gold Recovery Co. v. Northern Mining &amp; Trading Co., 7 Alaska 655 (D. Alaska 1927), rev'd, 25 F.2d 106, 5 Alaska Fed. 412 (9th Cir. Alaska 1928).

       <p>
        When damages are appraised prior to the construction of the improvements for which the land is condemned, the estimate should be made on the assumption that the improvements will be properly constructed; and, if they are constructed pending the condemnation proceedings, the rule should be the same. The actual effect of the properly constructed improvements in the manner proposed by plaintiff as to the larger parcels should control the appraisal.
        If the improvements are improperly or negligently constructed, no additional damage should be given for this reason. City of Anchorage v. Scavenius, 539 P.2d 1169 (Alaska 1975).

       <p>
        When an owner settles or receives a condemnation award in reliance on a construction plan which is implemented and later altered, the owner is entitled to just compensation for any resultant economic damage to the property, provided that a portion of the property was taken for the original construction project, and the remaining property decreased in value as a result of the alteration.
        The owner’s reliance must be objectively reasonable, based on the documents prepared to resolve the original condemnation action. State v. Lewis, 785 P.2d 24 (Alaska 1990).

        State was entitled to a new trial on the amount of just compensation required for the taking of an abutting landowner’s right of access to a controlled access highway, where the jury’s answers to special interrogatories were internally inconsistent and inconsistent with the general verdict and the jury’s conclusion that the remaining property was worth more after the taking than the entire parcel was worth before the taking was irreconcilable with its conclusion that the remainder received no special benefit from the highway project.

       <p>
        “Fair market value,” or the price a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for property, is the appropriate measure of “just compensation.” State v. Alaska Continental Dev. Corp., 630 P.2d 977 (Alaska 1980). See also Gackstetter v. State, 618 P.2d 564 (Alaska 1980).

        of just compensation where residential property was taken, even though fill and gravel from the property was utilized by the condemnor. Gackstetter v. State, 618 P.2d 564 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employment of the fair market value test where the property contained dirt and gravel fill which was removed by the condemnor and used elsewhere in the project to its benefit does not preclude the owners from receiving just compensation.
        It is a basic tenet of eminent domain law that just compensation is determined by what the owner has lost and not by what the condemnor has gained. Gackstetter v. State, 618 P.2d 564 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the state appropriated residential property for which the owners were justly compensated through employment of a fair market valuation measure, the superior court did not err in its determination that consideration of value to the state of the fill and gravel received from the land was an inappropriate measure of just compensation.

       </p>
       <p>
        In Alaska, inclusion of value enhancement attributable to the project for which the property is being taken is generally prohibited in determining condemnation awards.
        This general rule is in accordance with the requirement in the Alaska and United States constitutions that just compensation be paid for private property taken for public use, since it only prevents a landowner from receiving more value for his property than he would if the government had no use for his land and it was purchased by a private buyer. However, this rule does not preclude an owner from receiving compensation for value added to the property by an unrelated public project which took no portion of the tract involved. State v. Alaska Continental Dev. Corp., 630 P.2d 977 (Alaska 1980).

       <p>
        The fixing by statute of the date of valuation of property taken or damaged as the date of the issuance of the summons of the eminent domain complaint was intended to prevent the state from taking advantage of the drop in property values which occurs once real property has been condemned or personal property has been removed from the condemned building.

        When a landowner claimed interference with his remainder interest after an eminent domain taking, allegedly in violation of this section, a trial court did not err in denying the landowner’s motion to dismiss, or in refusing to set an alternative valuation date, because the correct date was the date of the issuance of a summons.

        Where property has been subdivided into smaller lots, and indication that a market for such lots exists is demonstrated by the sale of one lot prior to the date of taking, valuation evidence based in part upon the ascription of retail values to individual lots and comparable sales data should properly be admitted for the jury to consider.

         The principal test utilized for defining the “larger parcel”

        for severance damage purposes is often referred to as the “three unities” theory. According to that doctrine, three factors are employed in ascertaining whether property in which the taking occurs constitutes a single larger parcel.
        The factors are: Physical contiguity between the several parcels, unity of ownership, and unity of use. Babinec v. State, 512 P.2d 563 (Alaska 1973).

       <p>
        If competent evidence is presented indicating that by reason of condemnation of a portion of his property, remaining property owned by the property owner is diminished in value, the issue of severance damages should be presented to the jury, regardless of whether slavish adherence to the “three unities” theory might lead to a contrary result.

       Order authorizing plaintiff to continue in or take possession.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon application of the plaintiff at any time after the jury’s verdict has been returned or the master’s report has been filed in the court, the court may make an order that, upon payment into court of the amount of damages assessed in the report or by the jury, the plaintiff, if already in possession of the property sought to be condemned, may continue in possession and, if not in possession, the court may authorize the plaintiff to take possession of the property and use and possess it until the final conclusion of the proceedings, and that all actions and proceedings against the plaintiff on that account be stayed until that time.
      However, where an appeal is taken by the defendant, the court may also require the plaintiff to give a bond or undertaking with sufficient sureties before continuing or taking possession.
      The bond or undertaking shall be approved by the court and shall be in the sum the court may direct, and conditioned to pay defendant any additional damages and costs given by the judgment over and above the amount assessed, and the damages which defendant sustains if the property is not taken for public uses.
      For the purposes of this section the amount assessed as damages in the report or by the jury is considered as just compensation for the property appropriated until reassessed or changed in further proceedings. However, the plaintiff, by payment into court of the amount assessed or by giving security as above provided, is not precluded from an appeal, but may appeal in the manner and with the effect as if no money had been deposited or security given. If the plaintiff deposits the amount of the assessment and continues in possession or takes possession of the property and there is no dispute as to the ownership of the property, the defendant may at any time demand and receive from the court the money deposited, and the demand or receipt does not bar or preclude the defendant from the right of appeal. However, if the amount of the assessment is reduced on appeal by either party, the defendant who has received the amount of the assessment deposited is liable to the plaintiff for the difference between the amount received by the defendant and the amount finally assessed with legal interest from the time the defendant received the money deposited, and it may be recovered by action.

       The Senate Journal of Proceedings for 1966 indicates that two references to “first class city” in House Bill 418, now this section, were deleted, and the term “municipality” was substituted. In all probability this reflects an intention to broaden the scope of the statute to include municipal divisions other than first class cities.

       Under the latter no such vesting occurs; title does not vest, nor does “condemnation” actually occur until the final award is determined and an order and judgment of condemnation is entered by the court. ARCO Pipeline Co. v. 3.60 Acres, More or Less, 539 P.2d 64 (Alaska 1975).

       <p>
        There exists a clear functional distinction between proceedings in condemnation under a declaration of taking and those under a complaint seeking condemnation and an order for possession. Under the former, title passes immediately upon filing and deposit — at which time, under this section, the property is deemed to be “condemned and taken for the use of the plaintiff.”
        Under the latter no such vesting occurs; title does not vest, nor does “condemnation” actually occur, until the final award is determined and an order and judgment of condemnation is entered by the court. ARCO Pipeline Co. v. 3.60 Acres, More or Less, 539 P.2d 64 (Alaska 1975).

       <p>
        The difference in the nature of proceedings in condemnation under a declaration of taking and those under a complaint seeking condemnation and an order for possession is not merely procedural; the almost summary quality of the former bespeaks the grant of an additional substantive power of condemnation which considerably reduces the rights of the landowner to contest the taking.

        Under those circumstances the property owners necessarily will suffer a delay in receiving compensation for the value of their interest in the property taken.

         Compensation for delays. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Alaska Const., art. I, § 18, necessitates that a property owner be compensated for delays incurred between the dates of the government’s taking of property and making payment.
        If an award were paid immediately upon the taking of the land by the state no damages to the property owner would ensue.
        But where, due to the necessity of legal proceedings to ascertain fair market value of property, delays ensue, the property owner is entitled to an adequate sum to reimburse him for the loss of use of the money during the period of such delay.
        To hold otherwise would constitute a taking of the property without just compensation. Therefore, it is well established that the owner of property is entitled to interest from the date of taking to the date of payment. Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church v. Alaska State Hous. Auth., 498 P.2d 737 (Alaska 1972).

       (2), judicial inquiry into necessity or the condemnor’s determinations with respect thereto is not appropriate unless and until the condemnee has presented clear and convincing evidence that the condemnor has acted in bad faith or so capriciously and arbitrarily as to indicate the absence of any reasonable determining principle.

       Only specific allegations of fraud, bad faith, or some gross abuse of discretion in locating the pipeline could raise issues sufficient to permit judicial review of the necessity of the taking. ARCO Pipeline Co. v. 3.60 Acres, More or Less, 539 P.2d 64 (Alaska 1975).

       Where it is clear that the use intended is public and statutorily authorized, and condemnor has presented unrebutted evidence to the effect that the design and construction criteria for the pipeline are most feasibly satisfied by the route across the property of the owner, it cannot be said that condemnor is under any duty to initially submit evidence that it has considered alternate routing; nor can the failure to make such showing under the circumstances justify a finding of arbitrariness or an abuse of discretion.

     A general acute care hospital has a nondelegable duty to provide nonnegligent physician care in its emergency room and, therefore, the hospital may be held vicariously liable for negligent health care rendered by an emergency room physician who is not an employee of the hospital, but is, instead, an independent contractor.

       A patient and any health care provider may execute an agreement to submit to arbitration any dispute, controversy, or issue arising out of care or treatment by the health care provider during the period that the agreement is in force or that has already arisen between the parties.  Execution of an agreement under this subsection by a patient may not be made a prerequisite to receipt of care or treatment by the health care provider.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c55a06s09.55.535ol1b">
       An agreement to arbitrate executed before care or treatment is provided must clearly provide in bold print on the face of the agreement that execution of the agreement by the patient is not a prerequisite to receiving care or treatment.  If this subsection is not complied with by the health care provider, the agreement to arbitrate is void.  The form to be used shall be approved in advance by the attorney general of the state to assure it fairly informs both parties to the agreement and properly protects their interests.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c55a06s09.55.535ol1c">
       The agreement must provide that the person receiving health care may revoke the agreement within 30 days after execution by notifying the health care provider in writing.  The period for revocation shall be tolled during any period that the person receiving health care is physically unable to execute a revocation.  The health care provider may not revoke the agreement after its execution.

       An agreement to arbitrate between a patient and a hospital must be reexecuted each time a person is admitted to a hospital. The agreement may be extended by written agreement of all parties to apply to care after hospitalization. A person receiving outpatient care from a hospital or clinic or a member of a health maintenance organization may execute an agreement with the hospital that provides for continuation of the agreement for a continuing program of treatment or during continued membership.

       Upon the filing of a malpractice claim that is subject to an agreement to arbitrate, the claim shall be submitted to an arbitration board.  The arbitration board shall consist of three arbitrators: one arbitrator designated by the claimant or claimants, one arbitrator designated by the health care provider or providers against whom the claim is made, and a third arbitrator designated by mutual agreement who shall serve as chairperson of the board. If the parties cannot agree on the third person, the court will provide a choice of three or more persons who might serve as chairperson of the arbitration board, which shall be from a list of qualified arbitrators furnished by the attorney general. Claimant or claimants together and health care provider or providers together may each strike one or more names so that after each side has done so at least one name remains, providing a basis for the final selection by the court.

       The attorney general shall prepare a list of persons consisting of lawyers or other persons qualified to serve as chairperson of an arbitration board. They shall be selected on the basis of their technical expertise, judicial temperament, and capability of impartially acting on malpractice claims. The attorney general shall submit a list of at least three names whenever requested to do so by the court along with detailed biographical information on each person listed.

       In any case in which the answer to one or more of the questions submitted to the panel depends upon the resolution of factual questions that are not the proper subject of expert opinion, the report must so state and may answer questions based upon hypothetical facts that are fully set out in the opinion. The report must include copies of all written statements, opinions, or records relied upon by the panel and either a transcription or other record of any oral statements or opinions; must specify any medical or scientific authority relied upon by the panel; and must include the results of any physical or mental examination performed on the plaintiff. Each member shall sign the report and the signature constitutes the member’s adoption of all statements and opinions contained in it; however, a member may, instead of signing the report, submit a concurring or dissenting report that complies with the requirements of this subsection.  A member may not attest to any portion of the report as to which the member is not qualified to give expert testimony.

The court shall delete any portion that would not be admissible because of lack of foundation for opinion testimony, or otherwise.  Either party may submit testimony to support or refute the report.  The jury shall be instructed in general terms that the report shall be considered and evaluated in the same manner as any other expert testimony.

All expenses incurred by the panel shall be paid by the court. However, in any case in which the court determines that a party has made a patently frivolous claim or a patently frivolous denial of liability, it shall order that all costs of the expert advisory panel be borne by the party making that claim or denial.

       Where the free conference committee recommended adoption of a version of ch. 102, SLA 1976, that differed in many respects from the version originally passed by the house; the free conference committee’s bill was passed by the senate by a recorded vote; but in the house there was no roll call or recorded vote and the free conference committee bill was passed there by a simultaneous voice vote, this voice vote constituted “final passage” of ch. 102, SLA 1976, and thus violated the recorded vote requirement of Alaska Const., art. II,

       Although ch. 102, SLA 1976, was enacted in violation of the recorded vote requirement of Alaska Const., art. II, § 14, that holding was to be applied prospectively in light of conclusions that the decision was one of first impression, that substantial reliance had followed from the legislature’s alternative interpretation of law, that undue hardship would have resulted from retroactive application of the holding, and that the rationale of the holding did not compel retroactivity.

       Const., art. II, § 14, the supreme court did not invalidate this section.
       However, in order to effectuate the goals of fairness and intelligent advocacy, this section was not applied in the malpractice actions consolidated for this appeal. Plumley v. George E. Hale, M.D., Inc., 594 P.2d 497 (Alaska 1979).

       Trial court was not required to appoint an expert advisory panel in a medical malpractice case because this section was not enacted to protect pro se litigants, patient’s motion requesting the panel was untimely, and it would have been difficult or impossible to appoint three neutral urologists to the panel given the conflicts of interest and the small number of urologists practicing in Alaska.

       Where the claims did not raise strict medical malpractice issues requiring expert testimony, whether the hospital exercised reasonable care in supervising the patient represented a factual question for the jury’s resolution under an ordinary negligence framework, and it was error to require patient to present expert testimony regarding the hospital’s alleged breach of its duty of care.

       A trial court should have waited for an expert panel report, even though this section does not require the completion of such a report in order for a malpractice trial to proceed, where the trial court’s actions gave the parties a reasonable expectation that a panel would complete a report before trial, and where various motions regarding submissions were made by the parties, although the court never ruled on those motions and neither did it submit the case to the panel for review.

      <p>
       Estate’s contention that the medical review board was biased because of their social relationship with the physicians in a medical malpractice case was waived as the estate did not raise objections before appeal. Zaverl v. Hanley, 64 P.3d 809 (Alaska 2003).

       In medical malpractice actions the jury ordinarily may find a breach of professional duty only on the basis of expert testimony; however, the primary limitation to this rule is that expert testimony is not needed in non-technical situations where negligence is evident to lay people. Trombley v. Starr-Wood Cardiac Group, 3 P.3d 916 (Alaska 2000).

      <p>
       In a medical malpractice case, summary judgment was properly granted in favor of several healthcare providers because the patient failed to offer expert testimony to rebut the providers’ expert, who opined that a procedure performed to ascertain whether or not the patient had interstitial cystitis was appropriate based on the symptoms described and that the procedure could not have caused sexual dysfunction. Parker v. Tomera, 89 P.3d 761 (Alaska 2004).

       Where the inmate filed a lawsuit against the dentist for failing to timely treat his dental problems, the inmate failed to meet his burden of proof under this section; the inmate supplied no expert evidence on the proper course of treatment for periodontal disease, nor did he provide expert testimony to show that the dentist was negligent in his prioritization of inmate needs. Hertz v. Beach, 211 P.3d 668 (Alaska 2009).

      <p>
       In a malpractice suit against the anesthesiologist and medical providers involved in the patient’s surgery, the anesthesiologist and medical providers could not have been held liable on the basis of the testimony of the patient’s expert because he explicitly stated that he could not make the argument that the use of propofol was below the standard of care and that taking more than one attempt to intubate a patient was below the standard of care; and the expert failed to causally connect the transesophageal echo probe shutdown and the physician’s decision to proceed without a spare with any injury suffered by the patient; thus, summary judgment was properly granted in the anesthesiologist’s and the medical providers’ favor. Brandner v. Pease, 361 P.3d 915 (Alaska 2015) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a medical malpractice action, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the medical care providers, as plaintiffs' only expert witness, a pharmacist, was unqualified to provide testimony about the matter at issue because he was not a doctor of internal medicine and was not board-certified in the doctor's field or specialty.

Evidence of collateral sources, other than a federal program that must by law seek subrogation and the death benefit paid under life insurance, is admissible after the fact finder has rendered an award. The court may take into account the value of claimant’s rights to coverage exhausted or depleted by payment of these collateral benefits by adding back a reasonable estimate of their probable value, or by earmarking and holding for possible periodic payment under (a) of this section that amount of the award that would otherwise have been deducted, to see if the impairment of claimant’s rights actually takes place in the future.

        Physician must explain risk in lay terms. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Merely identifying a risk does not necessarily provide a patient with the information necessary for an informed decision. For a trial court to decide on summary judgment that doctor has disclosed sufficient information to allow a reasonable patient to make an informed decision about treatment, the record must establish that the physician explained to the patient in lay terms the nature and severity of the risk and the likelihood of its occurrence.

      </p>
      <p>
       The scope of disclosure required under subsection (a) must be measured by what a reasonable patient would need to know in order to make an informed and intelligent decision about the proposed treatment. Under the reasonable patient rule, a physician must disclose those risks which are “material” to a reasonable patient’s decision concerning treatment; under this view, expert testimony concerning the professional standard of disclosure is not a necessary element of the plaintiff’s case because the scope of disclosure is measured from the standpoint of the patient.

      <p>
       The requirements set forth in 7 AAC 12.120(c) are not inconsistent with this section. The regulations, simply impose a supplemental requirement that the patient’s medical record contain a “signed informed consent” before a surgical procedure may begin. Sweet v. Sisters of Providence, 895 P.2d 484 (Alaska 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a medical malpractice suit, the court found no merit in the patient’s contention that the implied consent form was invalid, because it was witnessed by a nurse instead of being signed in the doctor’s presence. Neither this section nor its implementing regulation, 7 AAC 12.120, require that the treating physician personally read the consent form to the patient or witness the patient’s signature. Harrold v. Artwohl, 132 P.3d 276 (Alaska 2006).

         History of section. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Examination of this section and its statutory predecessors suggests that the purpose of creating the wrongful death action was primarily to compensate those who had suffered direct losses as a result of decedent’s death. Beneficiaries such as spouses and children were probably enumerated in the statute because they presumptively suffered such loss. Parents were included in the 1955 amendments but excluded by the 1957 revision. In re Estate of Pushruk, 562 P.2d 329 (Alaska 1977).

         Model for statute. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Alaska wrongful death statute is closely modeled after the precursor of most wrongful death statutes, Lord Campbell’s Act, 9 &amp; 10 Vict.

       <p>
        Section 61-7-3, ACLA 1949, was taken from the Oregon Code. Kreidler v. Ketchikan Spruce Mills, 10 Alaska 365 (D. Alaska 1943).
       </p>

       <p>
        Where there is no surviving husband, wife, or children, then this section may be and has been construed to the same effect as the Oregon law.
        But the authority of the Oregon decisions ends there. Dralle v. Steele, 13 Alaska 680 (D. Alaska 1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any decision based upon the Oregon law as it existed on June 6, 1900 can be of little use in construing this section in any case where there is a surviving husband, wife, or children, and is likely to be completely misleading. Dralle v. Steele, 13 Alaska 680 (D. Alaska 1952).

        The “discovery rule,” which holds that a statute of limitations does not begin to run until a plaintiff discovers, or reasonably should discover, the existence of all the elements of his cause of action, applies to actions for wrongful death.

        The personal representative, though designated as the person to bring the action, does not derive any right, title, or authority from his intestate, but he sustains rather the relation of a trustee in respect to the fund he may recover for the benefit of those entitled eventually to receive it, and he will hold it when recovered actually in that capacity, in his name as executor or administrator, and in his capacity as personal representative, he may perhaps be liable on his bond for its proper administration. Koski v. Alaska Juneau Gold Mining Co., 6 Alaska 334 (D. Alaska 1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the decedent leaves a husband, wife, or children, then the administrator is a mere trustee for the husband, wife, or children, as the case may be — a person upon whom the law has cast the duty of bringing the action; for when the money is recovered it must go exclusively to the husband, wife, or children, and no other person has any interest in it.

       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section where widow and children survive, although the suit must be brought by the executor or administrator, such personal representative is a mere nominal party, who sues for the benefit of the real party in interest. Dralle v. Steele, 13 Alaska 680 (D. Alaska 1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the decedent is survived by a spouse, child, or dependent, the action is brought on behalf of the statutory beneficiary and damages are measured by the loss to the survivors.
        The personal representative is then a nominal party only and holds the recovery in trust. In re Estate of Pushruk, 562 P.2d 329 (Alaska 1977); State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wainscott, 439 F. Supp. 840 (D. Alaska 1977).

        Where a 5-year-old boy died from injuries sustained when he went abroad a barge and a pallet fell on him, the appellant established a prima facie case of liability. The arrival of the barge at a remote village was an infrequent and exciting event witnessed by practically the whole village, and the children let out of school for the occasion. Considering the well-known propensity of little children to see at first hand and explore something that was exciting and unusual, the circumstances justify an inference that appellee knew or had reason to know of the likelihood that children would attempt to get on the barge if it were accessible to them.

       </p>
       <p>
        Since the legal obligation to support children ordinarily terminates at approximately the age of majority, and because the reasonable expectations of a child for pecuniary contributions from his parents terminates under ordinary circumstances at about the same time, the formula’s employment as the years of significant damages for a child only those years between the age of the child at the time of his parent’s death and the age of majority has a rational basis.

       <p>
        In 1960 the statute (then former § 61-7-3, ACLA 1949) was amended to its present form.
        At that time, the legislature added “other dependents” to the class of statutory beneficiaries.
        Considering the history and purposes of the statute, this amendment appears designed to protect the interest of those who, like children and spouses, will suffer financial loss.

        The legislature, by adding “other dependents” to the categories of spouse and children, intended to embrace those who occupy a position similar to those in the specified classes and who were actually dependent upon the decedent for support at the time of his death.

       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court erred in determining that voters did not bring constitutional claims because they sought to protect their right to vote in municipal elections by asserting that a borough’s application of residency laws deprived them of their opportunities to vote, and they prevailed against the borough by having their voting rights restored; the voters could be entitled to full reasonable attorney fees and costs against the borough as constitutional claimants. Lake &amp; Peninsula Borough Assembly v. Oberlatz, 329 P.3d 214 (Alaska 2014).

       <p>
        Attorney fees award to borough officials was vacated, and the case was remanded for the superior court to base any Alaska R. Civ.

       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court did not err in awarding the State attorney’s fees related to preparing its opposition to a parolee’s motion for default because the State includes the time its attorneys took preparing the opposition in its attorney’s fees request. Hertz v. Schmidt, — P.3d — (Alaska Dec. 23, 2015) (memorandum decision).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since a parolee’s action was frivolous, the parolee did not have the protection of the statute. Hertz v. Schmidt, — P.3d — (Alaska Dec. 23, 2015) (memorandum decision).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court erred in awarding the Department of Fish and Game attorney’s fees for 50 percent of work for which the nature of the claim involved was not identified because such a pro rata approach was improper; the superior court had to ensure that fees are not awarded for work involving constitutional claims. Manning v. Dep't of Fish &amp; Game, 355 P.3d 530 (Alaska 2015), cert. denied, 577 U.S. 1148, 136 S. Ct. 1172, 194 L. Ed. 2d 193 (U.S. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court did not err in concluding that a graduate student was not a constitutional claimant for purposes of the university's request for attorney's fees where although she asserted a constitutional right with respect to her academic dismissal, she had two years of coursework invested in the Ph.D. program, and the opportunity to pursue a Ph.D. was an economic interest. Richards v. Univ. of Alaska, 370 P.3d 603 (Alaska 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was error to grant a prevailing broadcaster seeking injunctive relief under the Alaska Public Records Act full attorney's fees for a constitutional claim because (1) the broadcaster raised no constitutional claim in the s complaint asserting a statutory right, and (2) the award could not be upheld under Alaska R. Civ. P. 82, as the trial court specified no reasons for varying from the normal 20 percent award for cases resolved without trial and without a money judgment. City of Kodiak v. Kodiak Pub. Broad. Corp., 426 P.3d 1089 (Alaska 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a taxpayer unsuccessfully contested a board of equalization's denial of the taxpayer's request for a tax exemption, an award of attorney's fees to the board was error because the court did not address the taxpayer's claim that he was a constitutional litigant exempt from such an award. Markham v. Kodiak Island Borough Bd. of Equalization, 441 P.3d 943 (Alaska 2019).

         The authority to make awards of attorney fees is derived from this section,
        </b>
        which is of relatively ancient origin, dating from an Act of Congress of June 6, 1900, 31 Stat. 415-18, which was amended in 1923 by the Territorial Legislature of Alaska to expressly permit the courts to impose reasonable attorney’s fees. Stepanov v. Gavrilovich, 594 P.2d 30 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rule 82(a), which allows for the recovery of reasonable attorney’s fees, is supported by legislation which specifies that the supreme court shall determine when attorney’s fees are to be awarded.
        Thus, the award of attorney’s fees is authorized, though not mandated, by statute. Klopfenstein v. Pargeter, 597 F.2d 150 (9th Cir. Alaska 1979).

Crisp v. Kenai Peninsula Borough Sch. Dist., 587 P.2d 1168 (Alaska 1978), overruled, Rosen v. State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy, 689 P.2d 478 (Alaska 1984).

        The prevailing party to a suit is the one who successfully prosecutes the action or successfully defends against it, prevailing on the main issue, even though not to the extent of the original contention.
        He is the one in whose favor the decision or verdict is rendered and the judgment entered. De Witt v. Liberty Leasing Co., 499 P.2d 599 (Alaska 1972); Cooper v. Carlson, 511 P.2d 1305 (Alaska 1973).

        A party does not have to prevail on all of the issues in the case to be a “prevailing party.” Malvo v. J. C. Penney Co., 512 P.2d 575 (Alaska 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        A litigant who is successful in defeating a claim of great potential liability may be the prevailing party even though the other side is successful in receiving an affirmative recovery. Cooper v. Carlson, 511 P.2d 1305 (Alaska 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a party prevailed on every liability issue, and was unsuccessful only in his argument that he was entitled to nominal damages on his counterclaim, he was the prevailing party. Cooper v. Carlson, 511 P.2d 1305 (Alaska 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a general rule, the “prevailing party” is considered to be the party who has successfully prosecuted or defended against the action, the one who is successful on the “main issue” of the action and in whose favor the decision or verdict is rendered and the judgment entered.

        In a suit to determine the validity of a local initiative there were three main issues to be decided.

        Plaintiffs’ argument that if Rule 82 is used to award attorney fees against good-faith plaintiffs there is a risk it will operate as a “financial gag” resulting in a due process deprivation, ignores the financial burden such plaintiffs impose against those who are forced to defend against such actions in equal good faith.

       A non-notarized declaration submitted in response to a summary judgment motion failed to meet the requirements of subsection (a) where it did not assert that a notary or other authorized official was unavailable, and such a declaration does not satisfy the requirements of Civil Rule 56. Bennett v. Weimar, 975 P.2d 691 (Alaska 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a negligent maintenance case, the superior court properly excluded the unsigned and unnotarized affidavit of plaintiff’s expert witness at the summary judgment stage because there was no sworn statement indicating that the expert’s affidavit was made truthfully or under penalty of perjury, and no statement was ever submitted indicating that a notary was unavailable. Maines v. Kenworth Alaska, Inc., 155 P.3d 318 (Alaska 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Motion for a continuance was properly denied because it was unsworn, did not describe plaintiff’s past efforts to obtain replacement counsel after her prior lawyer had been allowed to withdraw, and did not set out plaintiff’s diligence in preparing for a pro se trial, although she had had ample time to prosecute her case since its inception. Greenway v. Heathcott, 294 P.3d 1056 (Alaska 2013).

      <p>
       Notarized statement was a “sworn statement” even without proof of the administration of a verbal oath, where the declarant showed his identification to the notary, knowingly signed the document in her presence, the document stated that the defendant was duly sworn, and the notary actually notarized it. Gargan v. State, 805 P.2d 998 (Alaska Ct. App.), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1209, 111 S. Ct. 2808, 115 L. Ed. 2d 981 (U.S. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A statement signed by defendants in the presence of the notary qualified as a “sworn statement” for purposes of perjury, even though the notary never actually administered an oath or affirmation to defendants. Knix v. State, 922 P.2d 913 (Alaska Ct. App. 1996).

      When reviewing conveyance documents that require an acknowledgment, it is the recorder’s responsibility to determine that an acknowledgment statement is present; if an acknowledgment clause is present on the document the recorder has no responsibility to assess the acknowledgment clause’s compliance with AS 09.63 or any other law. July 16, 1997 Op. Att’y Gen.

      Department of Natural Resources firefighters probably have a duty to rescue which removes them from the protection of this section. Thus, the state is liable through them for any negligence in the performance of that duty. May 22, 1980, Op. Att’y Gen.

      It is not necessary for recordation that an acknowledgment state the capacity in which the document was signed so long as the document itself, which is acknowledged, states the particular capacity in which it was signed. Sept. 2, 1982, Op. Att’y Gen.

      When an official of a land title company seeking to file a warranty deed in Alaska, in the presence of the recorder altered a California notary clause to change the name and the title of the person that the California notary public swore had appeared before her, the alteration destroyed the intended statutory effects of the acknowledgment clause as those effects are stated in this section, and the recorder’s office should have rejected the document for recording.

        For comprehensive discussion of municipality’s tort liability prior to the 1977 amendment, see City of Fairbanks v. Schaible, 375 P.2d 201 (Alaska 1962), overruled, Scheele v. City of Anchorage, 385 P.2d 582 (Alaska 1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislative history of paragraph (d)(5) makes it clear that the statute is designed to offer immunity only for damages incurred when municipalities act as Good Samaritans by agreeing to perform state functions in lieu of state personnel during emergencies. City of Seward v. Afognak Logging, 31 P.3d 780 (Alaska 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Paragraph (d)(2) does not shield municipalities from liability for the consequences of operational negligence. City of Seward v. Afognak Logging, 31 P.3d 780 (Alaska 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appropriate immunity analysis under subsection (d)(2) depends on whether the plaintiff brings a claim against a municipality or against its agent or employee; either claim is governed by the same words in the same statute, but for the claim against the municipality the court asks whether the challenged action carried out a planning or operational decision, whereas for the claim against the municipal employee it asks whether the decision in question involved personal deliberation and judgment.
        Lane v. City &amp; Borough of Juneau, 421 P.3d 83 (Alaska 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sovereign immunity and official immunity serve different interests and promote different policy objectives, and the difference between the two forms of immunity is more than mere semantics; therefore, a municipality does not automatically share the protection of its employees' personal immunity.
        Lane v. City &amp; Borough of Juneau, 421 P.3d 83 (Alaska 2018).

         Construction with other statutes. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the federal standard for immunity in civil rights claims is used in deciding whether an official is entitled to discretionary immunity under paragraph (d)(2), a defendant who was entitled to qualified immunity under that standard also would have been entitled to discretionary function immunity under state law, and the erroneous dismissal of whistleblower statute claims against him as an individual was harmless error. City of Fairbanks v. Rice, 998 P.2d 419 (Alaska), op. withdrawn, 20 P.3d 1097 (Alaska 2000).

        A city manager was permitted, if not required, to act in the public interest by taking reasonable action in the form of a public warning to the general populace pertaining to a matter of health and safety to prevent the creation of safety hazards even though such warning was defamatory.

       <p>
        When there was no evidence before the superior court suggesting that a city’s warning of safety hazards was issued with a knowing or reckless disregard for the truth of the statements it contained that communication was protected by a privilege extended to administrative officers making defamatory communications required or permitted in the performance of official duties even though there was no immunity under this section. Urethane Specialities v. Valdez, 620 P.2d 683 (Alaska 1980).

        In cases where it is alleged that the discretionary function performed by a government official has violated a statute or an ordinance, there may be liability if the officials have violated “clearly established” law, unless the officials can prove that they nonnegligently were not aware of the law.

       <p>
        Actions a city took through a city official were not immune because a campground resident sued the city, not the official; the superior court should have considered whether the actions complained of, the official's allegedly inconsistent instructions regarding alcohol use and her alleged failure to properly supervise the caretaker, were "planning" or "operational," not whether they involved the official's "deliberation" and "judgment.” Lane v.

        City official's decision concerning alcohol use at a campground was the result of deliberation and took into account various interests and objectives, and thus, the decision to allow "minor" alcohol consumption, so long as it did not cause problems, was a planning decision for which the city was immune.

       <p>
        Superior court erred in granting a city summary judgment because a campground resident's claim that a city official's explanation of the campground alcohol policy to the caretaker was inconsistent and confusing concerned an operational matter rather than a planning decision; once the city allowed some drinking in limited circumstances, it did not have the discretion to carry out those choices negligently, and it could be liable for the official's supervision of the caretaker.

      <p>
       At common law there is no duty to rescue. Lee v. State, 490 P.2d 1206 (Alaska 1971), overruled, Munroe v. City Council for Anchorage, 545 P.2d 165 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The law has persistently refused to recognize the moral obligation of common decency and common humanity, to come to the aid of another human being who is in danger.
       Only in certain limited situations, as for example where the actor was responsible for placing the imperiled person in his endangered position, has a duty been recognized.
       However, once rescue operations have begun, the rescuer is held to a duty of due care. Lee v. State, 490 P.2d 1206 (Alaska 1971), overruled, Munroe v. City Council for Anchorage, 545 P.2d 165 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>

       <b>
        The purpose of this section
       </b>
       is to induce voluntary rescue by removing the fear of potential liability which acts as an impediment to such rescue. Lee v. State, 490 P.2d 1206 (Alaska 1971), overruled, Munroe v. City Council for Anchorage, 545 P.2d 165 (Alaska 1976).

       This section is directed at persons who are not under some preexisting duty to rescue. Lee v. State, 490 P.2d 1206 (Alaska 1971), overruled, Munroe v. City Council for Anchorage, 545 P.2d 165 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       A rescuer under a preexisting duty to rescue would not need the added inducement of immunity from civil liability for his ordinary negligence. Lee v. State, 490 P.2d 1206 (Alaska 1971), overruled, Munroe v. City Council for Anchorage, 545 P.2d 165 (Alaska 1976).

       A holding that police officers have no duty to rescue would not comport with public conceptions of their role.
       Lee v. State, 490 P.2d 1206 (Alaska 1971), overruled, Munroe v. City Council for Anchorage, 545 P.2d 165 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section, the Alaska Good Samaritan statute, does not shield a police officer from liability for ordinary negligence.

      <p>
       By this section, Alaska has partially immunized the conduct of one who, voluntarily and without prior obligation, renders emergency aid.
       Because the Coast Guard has no legal obligation to go to the aid of a pilot who has crashed, the Coast Guard cannot be held to a higher standard of care than would be applied to a private individual under like circumstances, and the count of plaintiff’s complaint based on ordinary negligence must be dismissed. Bunting v. United States, 662 F. Supp. 971 (D. Alaska 1987), aff'd, 875 F.2d 250 (9th Cir. Alaska 1989).

       When the school district’s human resources director represented to a resigning teacher that there would be “nothing negative” on her record despite the fact that she was resigning to avoid termination for coming to work intoxicated and failing to complete a treatment program, the representation could have been a resignation agreement, and there was a genuine issue as to whether this representation consituted a waiver of immunity by the school district.

      <p>
       The legislature meant the term “unimproved land” to include the type of “improvements” which would normally be found in the bush and were either unknown to the landowner or were not in active use (i.e., abandoned roads, gravel pits, etc.), and for the immunity provided in this section to apply to all unimproved land in the state, except primarily improved property which has a portion of unimproved property. University of Alaska v. Shanti, 835 P.2d 1225 (Alaska 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the statute refers to “land”, the legislature intended the term to be read broadly to include natural bodies of water (i.e. lakes and rivers). University of Alaska v. Shanti, 835 P.2d 1225 (Alaska 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       To determine whether a particular tract of land is entitled to immunity under this section, on a motion for summary judgment, the judge should consider: (1) the proximity of improvements to the accident site; (2) the extent of property maintenance undertaken by the landowner; and (3) whether the character of the property as a whole justifies the conclusion that the landowner is responsible for reasonable risk management of the area. If the trial court concludes that reasonable jurors could disagree on whether the accident site is “unimproved land,” the summary judgment motion should be denied and the issue should be presented to the jury. If no reasonable disagreement is possible, the trial judge may rule on the issue as a matter of law. University of Alaska v. Shanti, 835 P.2d 1225 (Alaska 1992).

      <p>
       This section, as applied to an arrestee who filed a personal injury action against state troopers for allegedly using excessive force in apprehending him, did not deprive him of due process under the constitution of Alaska. Sun v. State, 830 P.2d 772 (Alaska 1992).

      <p>
       This section precludes a person who receives injuries in the course of a felony, and pleads nolo contendere to that felony, from later contesting whether he actually committed the felony. Sun v. State, 830 P.2d 772 (Alaska 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on public policy grounds, a civil plaintiff is collaterally estopped from relitigating any element of a criminal charge to which he has plead nolo contendere. Burcina v. City of Ketchikan, 902 P.2d 817 (Alaska 1995).

      <p>
       <b>
        Causation. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Arrestee’s commission of a felony, i.e., assaulting state troopers who attempted to apprehend him, “substantially contributed to the injury,” where nothing in the record showed a break in the nexus between the arrestee’s assault and the troopers’ instantaneous response thereto with deadly force. Sun v. State, 830 P.2d 772 (Alaska 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Dismissal of arrestee’s excessive force claim could not have been affirmed based on subsection (1) because the felony was mere possession of a firearm and mere fact that arrestee illegally possessed a firearm while fleeing in the woods would not have alone enabled the officers to use excessive force in his apprehension, and the crime standing alone could not have then been said to have substantially contributed to his injury. Maness v. Daily, 184 P.3d 1 (Alaska 2008).
