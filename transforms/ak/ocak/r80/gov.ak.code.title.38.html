    The provisions of Title 38 regarding acquisition, management and disposal of state land do not apply to land withdrawn from the state public domain as a state park or recreation area. Title 38 does apply to state forests, except that land in a state forest may not be conveyed to a third party and is subject to limitations on other types of state land disposals.

The rectangular survey section corner positions shall be monumented and shown on a cadastral survey plat approved by the state. For those areas where the state may wish to convey surface estate outside of an official rectangular survey grid, the commissioner may waive monumentation of individual section corner positions and substitute an official control survey with control points being monumented and shown on control survey plats approved by the state. The commissioner may not issue more than one conveyance for each section within a township outside of an official rectangular survey grid. Land to be conveyed may not be located more than two miles from an official survey control monument except that the commissioner may waive this requirement on a determination that a single purpose use does not justify the requirement if the existing status of the land is known with reasonable certainty. The lots and tracts in state subdivisions shall be monumented and the cadastral survey and plats for the subdivision shall be approved by the state. Where land is located within a municipality with planning, platting, and zoning powers, plats for state subdivisions shall comply with local ordinances and regulations in the same manner and to the same extent as plats for subdivisions by other landowners. State subdivisions shall be filed and recorded in the district recorder’s office. The requirements of this section do not apply to land made available for material sales, for short-term leases, for parcels adjoining a surveyed right-of-way, or for land that has been open to random staking under the homestead program in the past; however, for short-term leases, the lessee shall comply with local subdivision ordinances unless waived by the municipality under procedures specified by ordinance. In this subsection, “a single purpose use” includes a communication site, an aid to navigation, and a park site.

      On June 7, 1996, the enactment of CSSB 162(FIN) (Nineteenth Legislature, Second Session), designated as ch. 1, FSSLA 1996, became the subject of a lawsuit relating to the legislative override of the governor’s veto of that bill. On April 16, 1997, the superior court issued a Final Declaratory Judgment stating that the governor’s veto of CSSB 162(FIN) “was not timely overridden by the Alaska Legislature” and that “CSSB 162(FIN) was not enacted into law.”
      <i>
       Honorable Tony Knowles v. Legislative Council
      </i>
      , No. 1JU 96-1276 CI (Sup. Ct. Apr. 16, 1997). On appeal, the Alaska Supreme Court vacated the judgment and directed the superior court to dismiss the action, concluding that the matter was an action brought in the name of the state against the legislature in violation of article III, sec. 16 of the Alaska Constitution.

      The provisions of Section 2, ch. 20, SLA 1997, are given effect. These 1997 provisions are identical to the 1996 provisions of Section 2 of CSSB 162(FIN).

      On June 7, 1996, the enactment of CSSB 162(FIN) (Nineteenth Legislature, Second Session), designated as ch. 1, FSSLA 1996, became the subject of a lawsuit relating to the legislative override of the governor’s veto of that bill. On April 16, 1997, the superior court issued a Final Declaratory Judgment stating that the governor’s veto of CSSB 162(FIN) “was not timely overridden by the Alaska Legislature” and that “CSSB 162(FIN) was not enacted into law.”

On appeal, the Alaska Supreme Court vacated the judgment and directed the superior court to dismiss the action, concluding that the matter was an action brought in the name of the state against the legislature in violation of article III, sec. 16 of the Alaska Constitution.

         Regulations are subject to rule-making provisions of Administrative Procedure Act. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Regulations adopted by the commissioner of natural resources are subject to the rule-making provisions of Alaska’s Administrative Procedure Act (AS 44.62) and must be adopted according to the procedures set forth therein. Among the required procedures for adoption of regulations are notice of the proposed adoption, a public hearing in which any interested person may submit statements to the agency, filing of the regulation, if adopted, with the secretary of state, and publication. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The rule-making function of an administrative agency
        </b>
        frequently resembles the legislative process of passing a statute.
        Each entity determines the need for a particular enactment in light of chosen policies; each has procedures for the expression of views upon the merits of the proposal; and each, after consideration of the relevant policies and arguments, decides whether to adopt the proposed amendment. When administrative rule-making is based upon clear authority from the legislature to formulate policy in the adoption of regulations, the rule-making activity takes on a quasi-legislative aspect. Under proper standards, such delegations of legislative power to administrative agencies are constitutional. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).

         Judicial review of administrative regulation. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an administrative regulation has been adopted in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act (AS 44.62), and it appears that the legislature has intended to commit to the agency discretion as to the particular matter that forms the subject of the regulation, the supreme court will review the regulation in the following manner: First, it will ascertain whether the regulation is consistent with and reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of the statutory provisions conferring rule-making authority on the agency.
        This aspect of review insures that the agency has not exceeded the power delegated by the legislature.
        Second, the supreme court will determine whether the regulation is reasonable and not arbitrary.
        This latter inquiry is proper in the review of any legislative enactment. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).

         Scope of review. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        When a regulation has been adopted under a delegation of authority from the legislature to the administrative agency to formulate policies and to act in the place of the legislature, the supreme court should not examine the content of the regulation to judge its wisdom, but should exercise a scope of review not unlike that exercised with respect to a statute.

        The reasonable basis approach should be used for the most part in cases concerning administrative expertise as to either complex subject matter or fundamental policy formulations. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Application of the reasonable basis test is extremely useful where the administrative action under review resembles executive as opposed to legislative or judicial activity. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).

        Even though the administrative code provisions refer to the commissioner’s action on petition for reconsideration, where the director, division of lands, has denied an application for discovery well certification, as “reconsideration,” the actual process is that of the “review” authorized by paragraph (b)(3).

       <p>
        Both “review” and “reconsideration” in a broad sense refer to a reexamination of acts or a course of proceedings. But as normally used in the context of administrative adjudication, “review” implies a consideration of a case by one other than the entity which initially decides it, while “reconsideration” implies a reexamination, and possibly a different decision, of a case by the entity which initially decides it.

        Pan Am. Petroleum Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., 455 P.2d 12 (Alaska 1969), establishes the propriety of seeking judicial review of a division of lands decision without exhausting further remedies within the Department of Natural Resources.
        But it does not prohibit the pursuit of further remedies within the department, where those remedies exist pursuant to statutory authority and promulgated regulations, such as this section and former 11 AAC 516.32.

        These are situations in which one may possess the alternatives of either seeking judicial review directly from a decision of the division of lands or seeking review by the commissioner and then invoking judicial review.

      The division of aviation in the (former) Department of Public Works possesses the authority to manage the granted land for airport and directly related purposes while the division of lands possesses the authority to manage the land for other public purposes.

      In 1981, in paragraph (b)(7), the word “convey” was substituted for “dispose” at the beginning of the paragraph and in subsection (d), the words “of land” were added following “parcel” to correct manifest errors in ch. 113, SLA 1981.

      The zoning power vested in the Department of Natural Resources under this section is broad enough to encompass the creation of historical districts as a control over land use, but the exercise of that authority does not make the property eligible for historic preservation loans under AS 45.98, which is aimed solely at historic districts established by municipalities.

      Unless another method of sale is required under this chapter, AS 38.08, or AS 38.09, the sale of state land shall be made at public auction or by sealed bid, at the discretion of the director, to the highest qualified bidder as determined by the director. The director may accept bids and sell state land under this section at not less than 70 percent of the appraised fair market value of the land. To qualify to participate under this section in a public auction or sale by sealed bid of state land that is other than commercial, industrial, or agricultural land, a bidder shall have been a resident of the state for at least one year immediately preceding the date of the sale and submit proof of that fact, as the commissioner requires by regulation. A bidder may be represented by an attorney or agent at a public auction. An aggrieved bidder may appeal to the commissioner within five days after the sale for a review of the director’s determination. The sale shall be conducted by the director, and, at the time of sale, the successful bidder shall deposit an amount equal to five percent of the purchase price. The director shall immediately issue a receipt containing a description of the land or property purchased, the price bid, and the amount deposited. The receipt shall be acknowledged in writing by the bidder.

      On June 7, 1996, the enactment of CSSB 162(FIN) (Nineteenth Legislature, Second Session), designated as ch. 1, FSSLA 1996, became the subject of a lawsuit relating to the legislative override of the governor’s veto of that bill. On April 16, 1997, the superior court issued a Final Declaratory Judgment stating that the governor’s veto of CSSB 162(FIN) “was not timely overridden by the Alaska Legislature” and that “CSSB 162(FIN) was not enacted into law.”

On appeal, the Alaska Supreme Court vacated the judgment and directed the superior court to dismiss the action, concluding that the matter was an action brought in the name of the state against the legislature in violation of article III, sec. 16 of the Alaska Constitution.

      The state cannot use an application process for its disposal of land near the boundaries of a city that gives preference to that city’s residents with respect to lottery disposals under this section and probably also cannot do so with respect to homesite disposals under AS 38.08.

      On June 7, 1996, the enactment of CSSB 162(FIN) (Nineteenth Legislature, Second Session), designated as ch. 1, FSSLA 1996, became the subject of a lawsuit relating to the legislative override of the governor’s veto of that bill. On April 16, 1997, the superior court issued a Final Declaratory Judgment stating that the governor’s veto of CSSB 162(FIN) “was not timely overridden by the Alaska Legislature” and that “CSSB 162(FIN) was not enacted into law.”
      <i>
       Honorable Tony Knowles v. Legislative Council
      </i>
      , No. 1JU 96-1276 CI (Sup. Ct. Apr. 16, 1997). On appeal, the Alaska Supreme Court vacated the judgment and directed the superior court to dismiss the action, concluding that the matter was an action brought in the name of the state against the legislature in violation of article III, sec. 16 of the Alaska Constitution.
      <i>
       Legislative Council v. Knowles
      </i>
      , 988 P.2d 604 (Alaska 1999).

     <p>
      The provisions of Sections 7 and 8, ch. 20, SLA 1997, are given effect. These 1997 provisions are identical to the 1996 provisions of Sections 7 and 8 of CSSB 162(FIN).

       Best interest finding was not arbitrary and capricious because it was consistent with a basin area plan as the plan did not classify oil and gas development as a disfavored secondary use within the trail and the Department of Natural Resources was not required by the plan to identify mitigating measures to protect caribou during licensing.

      <p>
       While the adjudicatory provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (AS 44.62) are not applicable, due process considerations lead to the conclusion that it is incumbent upon the state to afford notice and a hearing to ensure due process before a state grazing lease may be terminated for noncompliance. McCarrey v. Commissioner of Natural Resources, 526 P.2d 1353 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Terminating state grazing leases without affording the lessee notice and hearing would undermine both the policy evinced by Alaska Const., art. VIII, and the explicit due process guarantee provided by Alaska Const., art. I, § 7. McCarrey v. Commissioner of Natural Resources, 526 P.2d 1353 (Alaska 1974).

      The state may place reasonable conditions on the use and access to tideland by the littoral owner, but it cannot completely prevent access and use by those owners unless such access and use would be completely unreasonable. Access rights depend on many factors, including who seeks to use state resources, how access is desired, the purpose for which the access is needed, and any pre-exisiting third party ownership interests in the tidelands under consideration, and they will be determined on a case-by-case review based on the factual circumstances of each request for access.

Each application shall be accompanied by an affidavit to the effect that the applicant presently intends to personally utilize the leased area for fishing purposes the following season. If two or more applications are received for the same shore area, the director shall award the lease to the most qualified applicant. In determining the qualifications of applicants, the director shall consider the length of time during which the applicant has been engaged in set netting, the proximity of the past fishing sites of the applicant to the land to be leased, the present ability of the applicant to utilize the location to its maximum potential, and other factors relevant to the equitable assignment of the disputed area. If the director cannot determine a preference between conflicting applicants for the same lease site on the basis of qualifications, the director shall select between the applicants by lot. An aggrieved applicant may appeal to the commissioner within 30 days for a review of the director’s determination.

      The lease conversion provisions enacted by 1977 legislation (§§ 12, 13, ch. 138, SLA 1977, as amended by § 21, ch. 182, SLA 1978) applied only to those leases entered into under the substantive statutory provisions which were amended by the 1977 legislation.
      Hence, substantive amendments to AS 38.05 could not be applied to a lease which was not authorized by the leasing provisions of AS 38.05, but rather by the leasing provisions of AS 38.35, and the state was not estopped from challenging the validity of the terms of a wrongfully converted lease.

An aggrieved bidder may appeal to the commissioner within five days after the sale for a review of the determination. The sale shall be conducted by the commissioner, and, at the time of sale, the successful bidder shall deposit the amount specified in the terms of sale. The means by which the amount of deposit is determined shall be prescribed by appropriate regulation.

       Pore space itself is a valuable State resource, its ownership is unnecessary to full enjoyment of the surface estate, and treating pore space differently from the rest of the mineral estate would be problematic for purposes of planning, leasing, and management; these are relevant statutory purposes, and they are better served by interpreting the term “mineral” to include the pore space in rock formations.

       Pore space is mineral and therefore within the express reach of the statutory reservation of all minerals of every name, kind or description, and storage rights in a specific identified natural resource are included by the statute's further reservation generally of all rights and power in, to, and over said land, whether herein expressed or not, reasonably necessary or convenient to render beneficial and efficient the complete enjoyment of the property and rights hereby expressly reserved.

       An oil and gas lease or a gas only lease must cover a reasonably compact area not exceeding 5,760 acres, and may be for a maximum period of 10 years, except that the commissioner may issue a lease for a period not less than five years upon a finding that it is in the best interests of the state. An oil and gas lease or gas only lease shall be extended beyond its primary term if, at the end of the primary term, oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the lease and for so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the lease or if the lease is committed to a unit approved by the commissioner. If a lease is not automatically extended under this subsection, the commissioner may approve a one-time extension of the primary term of an oil and gas lease or gas only lease upon written application by the lessee if the commissioner finds that the extension is in the best interest of the state. A person requesting a one-time extension shall send the request to the commissioner at least 180 days before the expiration date of the primary term of the lease. The length of the primary term of the lease combined with the term of the one-time extension may not exceed a total of 10 years. The commissioner shall consider the funds expended by the lessee to explore and develop the lease, the types of work completed by or on behalf of a lessee, and any other relevant information in deciding whether to extend the lease. Notwithstanding the provisions of (h) of this section, the commissioner may condition a lease extension on posting of a performance bond by the lessee, meeting a minimum work commitment, or both. The work commitment, if required, must be expressed in terms of money to be spent or type and amount of work to be performed. A lease issued under this section covering land on which there is a well capable of producing oil or gas in paying quantities does not expire because the lessee fails to produce oil or gas unless the lessee is allowed reasonable time to place the well on a producing status. Upon extension, if oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the lease or the lease is committed to a unit approved by the commissioner, the commissioner may increase lease rentals so long as the increased rental rate does not exceed 150 percent of the rate for the preceding year. If the commissioner grants a one-time lease extension, upon extension, the rental for the last three years of a lease extension shall increase to $250 an acre for each year, except that, at the commissioner’s discretion, the rental may be less than $250 an acre if the commissioner determines that a lessee has exercised reasonable diligence to explore and develop the lease during the primary term. If drilling, including operations such as redrilling, sidetracking, or using other means necessary to reach the originally proposed bottom hole location, has commenced on the expiration date of the primary term of the lease and is continued with reasonable diligence, the lease continues in effect until 90 days after drilling has ceased and for so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities. An oil and gas lease or a gas only lease issued under this section that is subject to termination by reason of cessation of production does not terminate if, within 60 days after production ceases, reworking or drilling operations are commenced on the land under lease and are thereafter conducted with reasonable diligence during the period of nonproduction.

      Former AS 38.05.305(a) did not apply to actions approving unit agreements in which one automatic consequence of unitization would be extension of the lease terms where the leases were issued prior to September 22, 1977, since extension of a lease term upon unitization did not constitute ‘‘renewal’’ within the meaning of former AS 38.05.305(a); moreover, there was good reason to believe that former AS 38.05.305(a) would also be inapplicable in the case of a unit involving state leases issued after September 22, 1977.

        Purpose of section. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this section were intended to insure that leases on valuable oil and gas producing state lands will be made available to the public on a fair and equitable basis, that the state will be adequately compensated for its natural resources, and that the state’s resources are developed in an orderly fashion. For the commissioner to decide that these purposes are furthered by providing for bidding by cash bonus cannot be said to be unreasonable.
       Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The assessment of the state’s oil and gas resources serves at least two legitimate government objectives. First, knowledge of the production potential of state land in various areas is critical to the determination of where development should occur and where preservation is appropriate. Second, knowledge of the oil and gas production potential of the state’s lands promotes the state’s economic welfare by maximizing the amount it receives for the lease of its lands. State, Dep't of Nat. Res. v. Arctic Slope Reg'l Corp., 834 P.2d 134 (Alaska 1991).

        The words “bonus” and “royalty”
       </b>
       in their broadest concepts and meanings are conflicting and overlapping. On the other hand, when it is necessary that they be distinguished, there is a narrower concept of the two terms as they are ordinarily and commonly used and understood in the oil and gas industry in which they do not conflict but are harmonious. In this narrower sense, a reservation or a payment of a part or percentage of production under a lease which is to continue throughout the life of the lease is regarded as ‘‘royalty,’’ and a sum certain to be paid in cash or out of production is regarded as ‘‘bonus.’’ Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In its broadest sense, ‘‘bonus’’ is any consideration given for a lease over and beyond the usual 1/8th royalty, whether the additional consideration be paid or payable and whether paid in cash or payable out of production. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In its broadest aspect, ‘‘royalty’’ is a share of the product or profit reserved by the owner for permitting another to use the property. In this broad sense, a sum certain to be paid out of production, although ‘‘bonus’’ in that it is consideration in addition to the usual 1/8th royalty, would also be ‘‘royalty.’’ Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).

      <p>
       It is not unreasonable for the commissioner to determine that it is in the state’s best interest to receive compensation for the leases immediately upon the award of the lease, rather than to wait for uncertain sums to arrive in the form of premium royalties. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971); Champion Oil Co. v. Herbert, 578 P.2d 961 (Alaska), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 980, 99 S. Ct. 565, 58 L. Ed. 2d 650 (U.S. 1978).

      <p>
       In considering only the cash portion of plaintiffs’ 33 bids, defendants acted pursuant to valid regulations which provided that a lease would be awarded to the bidder offering the highest cash bonus. Since other bids on the 33 tracts contained higher cash offerings than plaintiffs’ bids, the defendants acted properly in determining that the high cash bids on those 33 tracts were the apparent high bids, not plaintiffs’ bids.

       Application to reduce the rate of lease royalties they owed the State of Alaska to the discovery royalty rate under subsection (a) of this section was properly denied; the Commissioner of Natural Resources’ method of determining ‘‘geologic structure’’ did not conflict with the definition set out in regulations in place when lease was signed with state.

       Although the department of natural resources initially breached an oil and gas lease, it cured the breach by reinstating the lease without imposing new conditions but rather interpreted or applied the lease's terms. Termination was warranted when the lessee, following reinstatement of the lease, failed to diligently pursue drilling activities. State v. Alaskan Crude Corp., 441 P.3d 393 (Alaska 2018).

     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t38c05a07s38.05.181ol1a">
       The commissioner may, under regulations adopted by the commissioner, grant prospecting permits and leases to a qualified person to explore for, develop, or use geothermal resources.  When title to the surface parcel is held by a person other than the state, that person shall have a preferential right to a geothermal prospecting permit or lease for the area underlying the surface parcel.  The surface owner must exercise the preference right within 30 days after receiving notice of the application for a permit, or by agreeing to meet the terms of a bid within 60 days after receiving notice of the acceptance of the bid for a lease.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c05a07s38.05.181ol1b">
       The commissioner may designate a geothermal area or portion of it a competitive geothermal area.  A designation as a competitive geothermal area must be on the basis of substantial geologic indications of geothermal resources or on the basis of competitive interest in geothermal resources of the area.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c05a07s38.05.181ol1c">
       On state land that has not been declared a competitive geothermal area or withdrawn from geothermal prospecting, the commissioner may issue a prospecting permit to the first qualified applicant. The permit conveys an exclusive right, for a period of two years, to prospect for geothermal resources on state land included under the permit.  The commissioner has discretion to renew the permit for an additional one-year term.  A holder of a prospecting permit has the right, upon the showing of a discovery of geothermal resources in commercial quantities and the submission of a development plan acceptable to the commissioner, to convert the permit to a noncompetitive lease at a royalty rate under (g) of this section. The conversion privilege must be exercised not later than 30 days after the expiration of the permit.  If the land included within the permit is designated a competitive geothermal area during the permit term, the permittee must apply for a noncompetitive lease within 30 days after notification of the designation or forfeit the conversion privileges and the exclusive right to prospect.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c05a07s38.05.181ol1d">
       On state land that is designated a competitive geothermal area and is not subject to an existing prospecting permit, the commissioner may issue geothermal leases to the highest bidder by competitive bidding procedures established by regulations adopted by the commissioner.  At the discretion of the commissioner, competitive lease sales may be by oral or sealed bid, on the basis of a cash bonus, profit share, or royalty share.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c05a07s38.05.181ol1e">
       Prospecting permits and geothermal leases granted under this section must, except in the case of parcels subject to a preference right under (b) of this section, be issued for at least 40 acres but not more than 2,560 acres.  A person may not own, or hold an interest in, geothermal leases covering more than 51,200 acres.  However, geothermal leases in commercial production, individually or under a unit operation or well spacing or pooling arrangement, do not count against the acreage limitation.  All prospecting permits and geothermal leases are subject to an annual rental, payable in advance, of $3 per acre. The rental for a year shall be credited against royalties accruing for that year.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c05a07s38.05.181ol1f">
       A geothermal lease shall be issued for a primary term of 10 years and may be renewed for an additional term of five years if the lessee is actively engaged in drilling operations. A geothermal lease is valid for the duration of commercial production.  Beginning 20 years after the initiation of commercial production and at 10-year intervals thereafter, the commissioner may renegotiate the rentals and royalties due on a geothermal lease.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c05a07s38.05.181ol1g">
       Each geothermal lease shall be conditioned upon payment by the lessee of a royalty of 1.75 percent of the gross revenues derived from the production, sale, or use of geothermal resources under the lease during the first 10 years immediately following the date the geothermal resource first generates gross income and 3.5 percent of the gross revenues derived from the production, sale, or use of geothermal resources under the lease after that first 10-year period. Royalties may be taken in kind rather than in value if the commissioner determines that taking in kind would be in the best interest of the state.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c05a07s38.05.181ol1h">
       Regulations adopted by the commissioner to implement this section shall be adopted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (AS 44.62).

       The legislature finds that Kachemak Bay is an area of extraordinary abundance and diversity of marine life that has provided, and will continue to provide in the future, a basis for one of the state’s most important commercial fisheries; that recent information discloses that even minute quantities of oil released into the marine environment may be harmful to the larval forms of crabs and other marine life and that the existence of gyral currents within the bay may increase the likelihood of oil coming into contact with these valuable commercial fish and shellfish species; and that therefore oil and gas development in the bay, at this time, presents an undue hazard to this valuable state renewable resource.

       No additional oil or gas leases may be issued by the department or any other state agency for the exploration for or the development or production of oil and gas on state-owned land and waters seaward of the mean higher high water line, beginning at Anchor Point; then around the perimeter of Kachemak Bay, to Point Pogibshi; then west to the three mile limit of state land and waters; then north to a point three miles west of Anchor Point; then east to the mean higher high water line of Anchor Point, the point of beginning.

       The state’s mineral interest in lands on which the surface estate has been conveyed to a third party is “state land” subject to the location of state mining claims in the same manner as on lands owned entirely by the state. Hayes v. A.J. Assocs., 960 P.2d 556 (Alaska 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       A location made upon lands conveyed to a private party, with a mineral interest reserved to the state, was a “leasehold location” entitling the holder only to a preference right to a lease; the holder had no right to conduct mining activities until he applied for and received a lease from the Department of Natural Resources.

The commissioner shall establish the date of the commencement of the year during which the labor or improvements are to be performed. Labor shall be performed at the following annual rates: (1) $100 for each claim, leasehold location, or lease if the claim, leasehold location, or lease is a quarter-quarter section MTRSC claim, leasehold location, or lease; (2) $400 for each quarter section MTRSC claim, leasehold location, or lease; and (3) $100 for each partial or whole 40 acres of each mining claim, leasehold location, or lease not established using the MTRSC system. If more work is performed than is required by this section to be performed in any one year, the excess value may be applied against labor required to be done during the subsequent year or years, for as many as four years. For not more than five consecutive years, instead of performing annual labor, the holder of a claim, leasehold location, or mining lease may make a cash payment to the state equal to the value of the labor required by this subsection.

       The requirement that an act of the legislature is required where multiple purposes are closed in parcels exceeding 640 acres applied to the management of retained state land, not the disposal of it; thus, Department of Natural Resources agricultural classification of lottery parcels was proper, even though it did foreclose multiple purposes.

      On June 7, 1996, the enactment of CSSB 162(FIN) (Nineteenth Legislature, Second Session), designated as ch. 1, FSSLA 1996, became the subject of a lawsuit relating to the legislative override of the governor’s veto of that bill. On April 16, 1997, the superior court issued a Final Declaratory Judgment stating that the governor’s veto of CSSB 162(FIN) “was not timely overridden by the Alaska Legislature” and that “CSSB 162(FIN) was not enacted into law.”
      <i>
       Honorable Tony Knowles v. Legislative Council
      </i>
      , No. 1JU 96-1276 CI (Sup. Ct. Apr. 16, 1997). On appeal, the Alaska Supreme Court vacated the judgment and directed the superior court to dismiss the action, concluding that the matter was an action brought in the name of the state against the legislature in violation of article III, sec. 16 of the Alaska Constitution.

    <p>
     Ballot Measure No. 5 is unconstitutional because it is in direct conflict with the disclaimer provisions of §§ 12 and 13, art. XII, of the state constitution, and as a result, neither the Department of Natural Resources nor any other public agencies (e.g., the Department of Public Safety, etc.) should attempt to implement its provisions. 1983 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 2.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ballot Measure No. 5 probably is unconstitutional under provisions of the United States Constitution. 1983 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 2.
    </p>
    <p>
     Any state claim to ownership of public lands under the “equal footing” doctrine, which insures that new states are admitted to the Union with the same sovereign political rights and powers as all other states, faces substantial legal obstacles since it has never guaranteed economic equality through equalization of land grants. 1983 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 2.
    </p>
    <p>
     The argument that federal ownership of public lands within a state may constitute an interference with state sovereignty to the extent that it violates rights of the states under the
     10th amendment of the United States Constitution may not be successful in defense of Ballot Measure No. 5 or a similar measure.
     1983 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 2.
    </p>
    <p>
     The breadth of the claim to ownership and management of federal lands in Alaska in Ballot Measure No. 5 is a problem since, under the definition of land in the measure, there is no exception for federal buildings (e.g., post offices, schools, hospitals, etc.), other specifically recognized federal property (e.g., the Alaska Railroad, including its right-of-way and improvements), Alaska Native Allotments, and Alaska Native Townsite lots. 1983 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 2.
    </p>
    <p>
     The election pamphlet materials describing Ballot Measure No. 5 to the voters were incomplete in that the definition of lands and the criminal penalties were not included. 1983 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 2.

      </li>
      <li id="t38c05a13s38.05.500ol12">
       the attempted imposition upon the State of Alaska by the Congress of the United States of a requirement in the Statehood Act that the State of Alaska and its people “disclaim all right and title to any land or other property not granted or confirmed to the state or its political subdivisions by or under the authority of this Act, the right or title to which is held by the United States or is subject to disposition by the United States,” as a condition precedent to acceptance of Alaska into the Union, was an act beyond the power of the Congress of the United States and is thus void;
      </li>
      <li id="t38c05a13s38.05.500ol13">
       the purported right of ownership and control of the public land in the State of Alaska by the United States is without foundation and violates the clear intent of the Constitution of the United States; and

      <li id="t38c05a13s38.05.500ol14">
       the exercise of that dominion and control of the public land in the State of Alaska by the United States works a severe, continuous and debilitating hardship upon the people of the State of Alaska.

      Providing state land for a long-term, exclusive lease, at no cost, to a “youth encampment” (exempt from rental fees pursuant to subsection (d)), where the express purpose is to lead youthful campers to Christ, would result in the undeniable effect of placing the power, prestige and property of the state behind the advancement of one particular religious belief in violation of the Establishment Clauses of the state and federal constitutions.

      There would be no constitutional problem with a transfer of state land to a Methodist camp which is a nonprofit corporation organized for charitable purposes with nothing in its articles of incorporation indicating that its objective is to further the religious beliefs or dogmas of the Methodist Church, and where the lease or sale of the land to the camp would provide for the continued operation of a camp which, in the past, had served a broad cross-section of the public, and thus would accomplish a valid public purpose.

      There is no legal authority for the department to convey fee title to tidelands to a unified home rule municipality under subsection (a), but as long as the use to which the municipality intends to put the tidelands is a permissible use, it would be consistent with the public trust for the department to lease the tidelands to a unified home rule municipality for less than fair market value under this section.

     <p>
      The occupants of tidelands lying offshore of cities have present vested property rights under the 1957 federal Tidelands Act, which the state must recognize in acquiring rights-of-way for state roads. 1961 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 18.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before the state uses tidelands lying offshore of cities, the tideland occupants must be paid for the full value of the property they occupy. 1961 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 18.
     </p>
     <p>
      The division of land and water management may convey to a city tidelands and submerged lands located seaward of the city’s municipal boundaries, but this conveyance is subject to prior existing rights. The transfer should take the form of a quitclaim conveyance, which conveyance transfers only whatever right, title, and interest the grantor has in the property conveyed. November 26, 1984, Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The state may not make a conveyance of tidelands under this section to a unified home rule city, since a unified home rule city is a single political entity consisting of a borough and all cities within it, and paragraph (d)(4) provides that home rule cities and cities of the first class, the types of cities which may apply for such conveyances, do not include a borough.

        Purpose of section. —

      </p>
      <p>
       One purpose of the Alaska Land Act was to establish equitable methods of disposing of certain tidelands.
       Toward this end, and within the federal parameters requiring the recognition of “preference rights,” this section was included in the Act. Homer v. State, Dep't of Nat. Res., 566 P.2d 1314 (Alaska 1977).

        Due process required. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Private parties are entitled to due process of law before property rights may be removed; therefore, the minimal protection provided by adjudicatory procedures of the Department of Natural Resources must meet that standard. Homer v. State, Dep't of Nat. Res., 566 P.2d 1314 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipalities are entitled to due process in the adjudication of claims to tide and submerged lands. Homer v. State, Dep't of Nat. Res., 566 P.2d 1314 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to the disposition of tidelands, municipal corporations are to be afforded the same rights of due process as are private parties. Homer v. State, Dep't of Nat. Res., 566 P.2d 1314 (Alaska 1977).

        Scope of subsection (b) grant. —

      <p>
       The grant in subsection (b) of this section encompasses tideland adjacent to subsequently expanded municipal boundaries. Department of Natural Resources v. Haines, 627 P.2d 1047 (Alaska 1981).

       <b>
        In order for easement under paragraph (b)(6) of this section to be established,
       </b>
       it must appear that it is reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the property, the term “necessary” meaning that there could be no other reasonable mode of enjoying the dominant tenement without the easement.
       An easement by implication does not arise merely because its use is convenient to the beneficial enjoyment of the dominant portion of the property. Talbot's, Inc. v. Cessnun Enters., 566 P.2d 1320 (Alaska 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       While strict or absolute necessity is not required, something more than mere convenience must be shown before an occupant of tidelands is entitled to an easement under paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Talbot's, Inc. v. Cessnun Enters., 566 P.2d 1320 (Alaska 1977).

       A liberal construction of this section in favor of an applicant’s asserted beneficial use of tidelands fill is appropriate. City of Juneau v. Cropley, 429 P.2d 21 (Alaska 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       In light of the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (5) of subsection (b) of this section of the Alaska Land Act, which reflect the State of Alaska’s policy of permitting inclusion within the boundaries of occupied or developed tracts of such additional surrounding tide or submerged lands as are reasonably necessary for the occupant’s use and enjoyment, the superior court was correct in according a liberal construction to the term “occupant” and to the requirement that “beneficial use” be made of fill material before such material qualifies as a “permanent improvement.” City of Juneau v. Cropley, 429 P.2d 21 (Alaska 1967).

       Tidelands conveyed to private parties pursuant to Class I preference rights under this section were conveyed subject to the public’s right to utilize those tidelands for purposes of navigation, commerce and fishery.
       While patent holders are free to make such use of their property as will not unreasonably interfere with these continuing public easements, they are prohibited from any general attempt to exclude the public from the property by virtue of their title.

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The only limit upon this power

       <b>
        By “justly”

       The adjoining occupant may contest the determination in an adversary adjudicatory proceeding from which appeal to the superior court is guaranteed by paragraph (b)(6).

       In approving a city’s request for a conveyance of state-owned tidelands, the Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources did not adjudicate a disputed boundary between the city and an adjoining uplands owner. Because the boundaries of “tideland” are statutorily defined in general terms, and this section simply calls for a conveyance of eligible tidelands, there is no requirement that the Commissioner resolve the parties’ incipient boundary dispute, nor did the Commissioner attempt to do so.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The right, title, or interest of a bona fide purchaser of any lease, interest in a lease, or option to acquire a lease or an interest in it, acquired after the effective date of issuance of the lease and held by a qualified person, association, or corporation in conformity with this chapter may not be canceled or forfeited or otherwise adversely affected by reason of the fact that the holding of the person, association, or corporation from which the lease, interest, or option was acquired, or of a predecessor in title, including the original lessee of the state, may have been canceled or forfeited, or may be or have been subject to cancellation or forfeiture.
      If, in any proceeding for cancellation or forfeiture, an underlying lease, interest, or option is canceled or forfeited to the state and there are valid interests therein or valid options to acquire the lease or an interest therein which are not subject to cancellation or forfeiture, the underlying lease, interest, or option shall be sold by the director to the highest responsible qualified bidder by competitive bidding under general competitive leasing regulations subject to all outstanding valid interests therein and valid options pertaining thereto.
      Likewise if, in any such proceeding, less than the whole interest in a lease, interest, or option is canceled or forfeited to the state, the partial interests so canceled or forfeited shall be sold by the director to the highest responsible qualified bidder under general competitive leasing regulations.

      Money shall be appropriated from the general fund in an amount to be determined from time to time by the legislature to facilitate such work.
      Accounting of all costs and expenses of the surveys shall be made to the municipal corporation by the director periodically and a final accounting shall be made upon patent of the land to the municipal corporation.
      Costs and expenses chargeable to the city shall include the actual amount expended for the survey and a reasonable allocation of overhead, travel, and equipment expense.
      The total amount of costs and expenses shall be repaid to the fund through the director by the municipal corporation for whom the survey was made, with interest at six percent a year from the date of patent.
      The actual cost of survey of each interior subdivision shall be determined by the director.
      For tracts conveyed to a preference right holder, the state shall be reimbursed by the municipal corporation in the amount of the survey costs of that tract as determined by the director within 30 days after the transfer of each tract.
      For tracts conveyed, leased, or otherwise disposed of by the municipal corporation, the fund shall be reimbursed by the municipal corporation in an amount equal to 90 percent of the gross proceeds of the sale, lease, or other disposal of each tract until the total amount of the costs and expenses of the survey, with interest, due the state is paid.
      The total amount, with interest, shall be reimbursed to the state within five years from the date of patent.

      The plane coordinates of a point on the earth’s surface, to be used in expressing the position or location of the point in the appropriate zone of this system, consist of two distances, expressed in feet and decimals of a foot when using the Alaska Coordinate System of 1927 and expressed in meters and decimals of a meter when using the Alaska Coordinate System of 1983. One of these distances, known as the “x-coordinate,” gives the position in an east-and-west direction; the other known as the “y-coordinate” gives the position in a north-and-south direction.
      These coordinates shall be made to depend upon and conform to the coordinates of the North American Horizontal Geodetic Control Network as determined by the National Geodetic Survey, National Ocean Service.

Except to the extent authorized by an oil and gas lease, a gas only lease, or an oil and gas or gas only unit agreement approved by the state, no person may engage in any construction or operation of any part of an oil, products, or natural gas pipeline, which in whole or in part is or is proposed to be on state land unless that person has obtained from the commissioner a right-of-way lease of the land under this chapter.

      The lease conversion provisions enacted by 1977 legislation (§§ 12, 13, ch. 138, SLA 1977, as amended by § 21, ch. 182, SLA 1978) applied only to those leases entered into under the substantive statutory provisions which were amended by the 1977 legislation.
      Hence, substantive amendments to AS 38.05 could not be applied to a lease which was not authorized by the leasing provisions of AS 38.05, but rather by the leasing provisions of this chapter, and the state was not estopped from challenging the validity of the terms of a wrongfully converted lease.

       In a landowner’s suit against a party who purchased an interest in a portion of the property on which the landowner’s cabin grounds stood, the trial court erred in granting the landowner the land 300 feet to the west of the cabin by adverse possession because flagging was a non-permanent marker and, without more permanent indications of use such as clearing of land or erecting permanent improvements, the flagging alone was not sufficient to support finding a boundary line 300 feet to the west of the cabin. And given that the road leading to the cabin was a long-standing public trail, the landowner could not claim title to the trail through adverse possession. Vezey v. Green, 171 P.3d 1125 (Alaska 2007).
