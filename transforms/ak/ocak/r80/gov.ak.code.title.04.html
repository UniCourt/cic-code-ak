        Evidence sufficient to convict of manufacturing alcohol. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s conviction for manufacturing alcohol in a local option community because, when viewed in the light most favorable to upholding the verdict, the totality of the evidence constituted a sufficient basis for fair-minded jurors to conclude that defendant manufactured homebrew; an appellate court does not judge the weight of the evidence or consider witness credibility anew.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a case involving manufacturing alcohol, the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, even though defendant contended that the case was based on unreliable evidence, because the appellate court did not weigh the evidence or judge anew the credibility of the witnesses. The totality of the evidence was sufficient for a fair-minded juror to conclude that defendant manufactured the homebrew.

      <p>
       Defendant’s claim that the trial court erroneously rejected his proposed mitigating factor was moot because the presence or absence of a mitigating factor had no impact on the trial court’s sentencing authority in this case. The trial court was authorized to sentence defendant to as little as 120 days in jail for illegally manufacturing alcohol, with or without a mitigating factor; however, defendant was free to rely on the facts that supported the least serious mitigator to argue that the court should impose the lowest possible sentence.

      </p>
      <p>
       Sentence of six months’ incarceration as a condition of receiving a suspended imposition of sentence, upon conviction of one count of selling intoxicating beverages without a license in a local option area, was not clearly mistaken, where defendant had set up a commercial enterprise, although of short duration, and sold a pint of whiskey to a man who murdered a woman shortly after buying the whiskey.

        Sentence modification. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A trial judge who sentenced a worst offender to two maximum consecutive terms of one year for conviction of one count of selling alcoholic beverages without a license and one count of possession of alcoholic beverages for sale in a local option area, with 275 days of the first sentence suspended, was clearly mistaken in imposing consecutively the unsuspended portion of the offender’s jail term for selling alcoholic beverages without a license, where the judge specifically commented at sentencing that the chances for the offender’s rehabilitation seemed good and that there was no reason to believe the offender would be inclined to resume a criminal lifestyle.
       In order to impose consecutive sentences that exceed the maximum sentence for the single most serious count, the sentencing court must expressly find that the full term of imprisonment is necessary for the protection of the public. Peruski v. State, 711 P.2d 573 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).

        Use of part of club premises for public dining room. —

      </p>
      <p>
       While the use of a part of the club premises for a public dining room might have been in some degree inconsistent with its restricted and private use as part of the club premises, nothing in the law forbade such duplicate use.
       There was no legal reason why members of the club should not purchase and be served with intoxicating liquor in that room under the club license, although persons not members of the club and not beneficiaries of the bounty of the members of the club could not lawfully purchase any liquor there.
       In re Alaska Labor Trades Ass’n, 10 Alaska 472 (D. Alaska 1945) (This section now provides that “soliciting of public patronage of the club premises except as approved by the board is a violation of this section.” — Ed. note)

       Where evidence given at the hearing disclosed that persons other than members of the club had been served with liquor on the club’s premises, but there was no testimony that any of the nonclub members so served paid for the liquor consumed, the only proper presumption in which the court can indulge is that the liquor so served was sold to and paid for by members of the club and, therefore, the sales were lawful.

        Right to petition ABC Board as serving as security interest. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board was authorized under former AS 04.10.010 to control the sale of intoxicating liquor by issuing only those licenses which it considered “in the best interests of the public,” any transferee, even one who took for valuable consideration, actually took only the right to petition the ABC Board for transfer of the license. But where creditor and debtor intended a liquor license to be subject to a security interest by virtue of a written agreement, which directed the bank to retain the executed transfer application until buyer default, it was the right to petition which the parties intended to serve as a security interest. Queen of the N., Inc. v. LeGrue, 582 P.2d 144 (Alaska 1978).

        Authority of court to declare equitable lien and transfer license to preserve assets. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court found that a creditor had a security interest in a liquor license in the nature of an equitable lien, which was enforceable against the debtors and subject to foreclosure, and ordered the transfer of the license, under its general equity powers. The court had the authority to declare an equitable lien and to order the transfer of the license, but only insofar as it was necessary to preserve the asset; the equitable lien should not have operated beyond the statutory minimum number of days needed in order to prevent its lapse.

       and
       Alaska Admin. Code tit. 3, § 304.180(a)(4), the term “best interests of the public” is not vague. A number of factors are listed that can lead to a determination that renewal would not be in the public interest, including criminal acts, violations of regulations or other laws, untrustworthiness, unfitness to conduct a licensed business, being a potential source of public harm, and allowing sexual contact on the licensed premises. The regulation names these factors and allows the Board to consider all other factors the Alcohol and Beverage Control Board in its discretion determines relevant to the public interest. While this scope is broad, it is not unconstitutionally vague.

      The Uniform Commercial Code — Bulk Transfers provisions,
      AS 45.06 (repealed in 1993) did not govern the transfer of an alcoholic beverage license under paragraph (4)(B) of this section but might be valuable guidelines for the board to follow in promulgating regulations under this section. April 22, 1985 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unless essentially all of a business was being transferred, and not just a liquor license, the UCC-Bulk Transfer provisions (repealed in 1993) did not apply. April 22, 1985 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The federal Internal Revenue Service may assert a lien-like interest, in the form of a hold on transfer of an Alaska liquor license, for taxes but it may not assert a traditional lien against a liquor license. January 17, 1991 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The IRS may not foreclose on a liquor license against which it has a tax lien or lien-like interest. January 17, 1991 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the IRS has purported to seize a liquor license, it may not operate the license or transfer it to another person without board approval. January 17, 1991 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unless a debt has been discharged by satisfaction or extinguished by the courts, “debt” would include unpaid obligations, even if a judicial action on the debt is barred by the statute of limitations. January 25, 1991 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although a local governing body could not assert a hold on transfer of a license for unpaid taxes if the transfer was pursuant to AS

      (4)(B), the local governing body could protest the transfer. The ABC Board should uphold a local governing body protest of transfer based on unpaid taxes unless the board finds the protest arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable based on the particular circumstances. Aug. 29, 1994 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ABC Board has historically not required the satisfaction of a mortgage debt for real property containing the licensed premises as a condition to transfer of the license. The board has found that the debt did not arise from the “conduct of the business licensed.” However, if the seller of the property had restricted the use of the property to a particular use, such as operation of a licensed premises, then it might be appropriate to consider the debt as arising from the licensed business. Otherwise, the board is not required to deviate from its historic practice on this issue. Aug. 29, 1994 Op. Att’y Gen.

       In a case in which the State prosecuted an individual defendant and the air carrier that he and his wife owned for unlawful importation of alcoholic beverages into a local option community, the trial court properly denied a defense request for a jury instruction on spoliation of evidence.
       The appellate court agreed with the trial judge that, because troopers never collected the bags and boxes which contained the alcoholic beverages, they were not required to preserve them.

       In a case in which, between the time a defendant committed the offense of bootlegging and the time he was tried and convicted, the voters in Bethel, Alaska repealed the local ban on the sale of alcohol, defendant remained properly convicted of a felony offense. The decision by Bethel, Alaska to allow the sale of alcohol by properly licensed liquor stores was not a justification for reducing the level of offense that defendant committed. Yako v. State, 317 P.3d 627 (Alaska Ct. App. 2014).

       Maximum one-year sentence imposed for importing alcohol into a dry village did not violate defendant’s due process rights because he had a lengthy history of misdemeanor convictions and was specifically advised that a maximum term could be imposed.
       Egoak v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. July 27, 2011) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a conviction for importation of alcoholic beverages into a local option community, the trial court did not rely on improper considerations in formulating defendant’s sentence because the felony aggravator that defendant’s criminal conduct was designed to obtain substantial pecuniary gain where the risk of prosecution and punishment for the conduct was slight did not apply to her case; the judge made it very clear that he was not inferring that defendant was going to resell the alcohol she imported; the judge explained that the primary focus of defendant’s sentence was deterrence; and the judge’s comments focused on the relatively large quantity of alcohol involved and the negative consequences of alcohol importation to a dry community.

       Legally sufficient evidence supported defendant’s convictions for importing liquor into a local option area and fourth-degree misconduct involving a controlled substance because defendant’s fingerprints were found inside a package containing alcohol and marijuana that was sent to a local option area, and the jury heard evidence that linked the suspicious package to defendant and his residence.

       Sufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction for transporting alcohol into a community that banned alcohol importation because a jury could find from defendant's acts, the acts of another for which defendant was legally responsible, or a combination thereof, that the two executed a plan to import alcohol into such a community.

       are “defenses” to criminal liability; that is, if a defendant wishes to invoke one of these exceptions, then at the very least the defendant must affirmatively raise the exception and point to some evidence from which a reasonable jury could decide that issue in his or her favor. Accordingly, where defendant presented no evidence that he had received his alcoholic beverages from a parent, guardian, or spouse, his conviction was affirmed. Trout v.

       Although the Alaska Constitution requires that similarly situated individuals be treated equally, this section does not violate equal protection by requiring younger offenders to stay on probation longer than older offenders; the state’s interest in preventing underage drinking is sufficiently strong, the importance of the minor defendants’ interest was relatively low, and the challenged probation provision has a substantial relationship to the social policy of preventing underage drinking.

      </p>

       Where defendant was charged with violating this section, which prohibited consuming or possessing alcoholic beverages while younger than 21, the potential penalty for the offense was sufficiently severe that defendant was entitled to a jury trial and to counsel at public expense.

       When a defendant is charged with either “repeat minor consuming” or “habitual minor consuming,” the existence of the defendant’s prior convictions is an element of the offense which must be decided by the jury. Oskolkoff v. State, 276 P.3d 490 (Alaska Ct. App. 2012).

       To prove defendant guilty under this section, the State did not have to prove that she actually consumed alcohol, only that she knowingly possessed or controlled alcoholic beverages, and she never disputed that she picked up a bottle of beer and brought it to her lips in front of a police officer; this established that she was in possession and control of an alcoholic beverage, and thus any error in the limitations on her defense related to her boyfriend’s violent tendencies, which she claimed made her falsely confess to the crime, did not affect the jury’s verdict.

      <p>
       Defendant did not personally waive her right to a jury trial on the prior conviction element of repeat minor consuming, and the district court found defendant guilty based on her counsel’s stipulation to that element, which was reversible error; the error only entitled defendant to a new trial on the prior conviction element, as counsel agreed to an initial phase of trial to litigate the minor consuming element and a second phase to litigate the prior conviction element, and defendant’s rights would not be violated if the district court convened a second jury solely to determine the issue of her prior conviction.

      </p>
      <p>
       The “violations” defined in Title 4, like the infractions defined in Title 28 and the violations defined in Title 16, are a class of quasi-criminal offenses which, while they are not serious, are to be disposed of within the criminal justice system. These violations can be enforced by traditional criminal procedures, including the use of search warrants. State v. Euteneier, 31 P.3d 111 (Alaska Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court erred in granting a defendant’s motion to suppress evidence discovered pursuant to a search warrant in a prosecution for consuming alcohol as a minor, because while consuming alcohol as a minor was classified as a violation rather than a misdemeanor, search warrants could validly be issued to investigate violations. State v. Euteneier, 31 P.3d 111 (Alaska Ct. App. 2001).

       At a minimum, the exceptions specified under subsection (b) are “defenses” to criminal liability; that is, if a defendant wishes to invoke one of these exceptions, then at the very least the defendant must affirmatively raise the exception and point to some evidence from which a reasonable jury could decide that issue in his or her favor. Accordingly, where defendant presented no evidence that he had received his alcoholic beverages from a parent, guardian, or spouse, his conviction was affirmed. Trout v. State, 866 P.2d 1323 (Alaska Ct. App. 1994).

       <b>
        The responsibility which former AS 04.10.180 cast upon liquor licensees
       </b>
       was the responsibility to answer to criminal sanctions imposed and to the administrative sanctions of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. Barton v. Lund, 563 P.2d 875 (Alaska 1977).

        Liability of licensee. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of a statute expressly imposing liability, a person was not liable to a wholesale liquor dealer for the purchase money for liquor merely because he owned the liquor license for the establishment where the dealer had sold the liquor.
       The protection of creditors of retail dealers in liquor did not come within the spirit or purpose of purely regulatory or revenue producing liquor license statutes. Sabre Jet Room v. K &amp; L Distribs., 384 P.2d 952 (Alaska 1963).

      <p>
       Although it was true that policy embodied in former AS 04.10.180 could also be enforced by criminal and administrative sanctions, there was no reason for giving that statute a narrow interpretation that would preclude a private right of action for unlawful conduct.
       Alesna v. Le Grue, 614 P.2d 1387 (Alaska 1980), overruling Barton v. Lund, 563 P.2d 875 (Alaska 1977).

       It is not unfair to hold a licensee responsible for the establishment’s operation even though the licensee does not have actual control of the day-to-day functions. Alesna v. Le Grue, 614 P.2d 1387 (Alaska 1980).

       Restriction of the defense of lack of profit to misdemeanor prosecutions under subsection (a) of this section does not constitute a violation of due process; the section treats all persons charged with felonies alike and, therefore, fairly.

      <p>
       Statutory distinction between a misdemeanant and a felon based solely on the type and quantity of alcoholic beverages imported does not violate due process; the greater the volume of alcoholic beverages imported, the greater the potential for abuse, whether importation is for sale or personal use.

       Limiting the “no personal profit” defense so that it is not available to someone who sells liquor to a minor or who sells liquor in a community that has voted to ban liquor sales is charge that has a rational basis and is not a denial of due process.

       Maximum one-year sentence imposed for importing alcohol into a dry village did not violate defendant’s due process rights because he had a lengthy history of misdemeanor convictions and was specifically advised that a maximum term could be imposed.

       Legally sufficient evidence supported defendant’s convictions for importing liquor into a local option area and fourth-degree misconduct involving a controlled substance because defendant’s fingerprints were found inside a package containing alcohol and marijuana that was sent to a local option area, and the jury heard evidence that linked the suspicious package to defendant and his residence.

       Defendant’s sentence was illegal because he was sentenced as a second felony offender, but defendant had been convicted of four felonies, and the most recent prior felony conviction occurred less than ten years before the current conviction, so the trial court had no discretion not to consider all of defendant’s prior felony convictions. Defendant should have been sentenced as a third felony offender.

       A trial judge who sentenced a worst offender to two maximum consecutive terms of one year for conviction of one count of selling alcoholic beverages without a license and one count of possession of alcoholic beverages for sale in a local option area, with 275 days of the first sentence suspended, was clearly mistaken in imposing consecutively the unsuspended portion of the offender’s jail term for selling alcoholic beverages without a license, where the judge specifically commented at sentencing that the chances for the offender’s rehabilitation seemed good and that there was no reason to believe the offender would be inclined to resume a criminal lifestyle.
       In order to impose consecutive sentences that exceed the maximum sentence for the single most serious count, the sentencing court must expressly find that the full term of imprisonment is necessary for the protection of the public. Peruski v. State, 711 P.2d 573 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).

       In a conviction for importation of alcoholic beverages into a local option community, the trial court did not rely on improper considerations in formulating defendant’s sentence because the felony aggravator that defendant’s criminal conduct was designed to obtain substantial pecuniary gain where the risk of prosecution and punishment for the conduct was slight did not apply to her case; the judge made it very clear that he was not inferring that defendant was going to resell the alcohol she imported; the judge explained that the primary focus of defendant’s sentence was deterrence; and the judge’s comments focused on the relatively large quantity of alcohol involved and the negative consequences of alcohol importation to a dry community.

       Paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, when read together, bar a municipality from taxing only the sale of alcoholic beverages and further require that if sales taxes are imposed on other commodities, then the rate of taxation on the sale of alcoholic beverages may not exceed the rate of taxation imposed upon such other commodities sales.

      </p>
      <p>
       This section is not so completely lacking in rationality or legitimacy of purpose as to be unconstitutional. Immunizing social hosts from liability caused by their guests’ conduct can rationally be based on a view that it is an undesirable interference with normal hospitality to require a social host to monitor guests’ alcohol consumption. Further, the primary actor responsible for harm caused by a drunken person is the drunken person. Chokwak v. Worley, 912 P.2d 1248 (Alaska 1996).

       Even though the plaintiffs may frame the “but for” causation question in terms of the providee’s intoxication, they are not required to do so, and may instead take the more traditional approach toward proximate cause, that is, in terms of the negligent provision of the liquor.

      <p>
       Although it was true that policy embodied in former AS 04.10.180 could also be enforced by criminal and administrative sanctions, there was no reason for giving that statute a narrow interpretation that would preclude a private right of action for unlawful conduct.

      <p>
       Employer, as a social host, owed no legal duty to plaintiffs. Since employer did not hold a liquor license, it was not liable as a social host for injuries resulting from a guest’s intoxication, nor was it liable (under a “control” theory) as the employer of an intoxicated person who caused injuries. Mulvihill v. Union Oil Co., 859 P.2d 1310 (Alaska 1993).

      <p>
       Allegations by widow, whose husband fell from a dock and drowned after drinking on his cousin’s boat, that the cousin owed a duty to control the decedent’s drinking under federal admiralty law, failed to show that a characteristic feature of maritime law would be materially prejudiced by applying this section. Christiansen v. Christiansen, 152 P.3d 1144 (Alaska), cert. denied, 551 U.S. 1132, 127 S. Ct. 2982, 168 L. Ed. 2d 704 (U.S. 2007).

       Given the plain language of this section and the absence of convincing contrary legislative history, the court cannot by statutory interpretation construe this section to be inapplicable to nonlicensees who illegally furnish liquor to minors. Chokwak v. Worley, 912 P.2d 1248 (Alaska 1996).

      </p>
      <p>
       Even though this section does not define the elements of all viable causes of action against liquor licensees, it does present a bar to all such causes of action based on providing alcoholic beverages if the conditions giving rise to immunity are met. A jury’s conclusion that defendant did not with criminal negligence sell to a drunken person means that defendant was immune under the statute for all unlawful providing claims. The focus of the jury’s attention should be whether the seller responded as a reasonable person would to the appearance and outward behavior manifestations of the person to whom the alcoholic beverage was sold, not on any specialized training the seller should have had as an aid to recognizing when a person is intoxicated. Gonzales v. Safeway Stores, 882 P.2d 389 (Alaska 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is no longer an “exceptional statute” in light of the enactment of pure several liability; in the dram shop context, Alaska now follows a policy of pure several liability. Sowinski v. Walker, 198 P.3d 1134 (Alaska 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although substantial evidence was proffered that a bar customer showed no obvious signs of intoxication while in the bar, there was significant expert testimony to the contrary, such that granting of summary judgment in favor of the bar in a dram shop action was error.

      </p>
      <p>
       When a lawyer representing a bar failed to join the bar’s intoxicated patron in an action alleging the bar’s violation of this section, it was error to dismiss the client’s legal malpractice action against the lawyer on grounds that the law on this issue was unsettled at the time the lawyer represented the client. While the law on whether the client could join the patron for allocation of fault related to subsection (a) of this section was unsettled, a reasonably prudent defense lawyer would have considered attempting to add the patron as a defendant for fault allocation.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the issue of permissible suit against multiple defendants in a dram shop action was not settled at the time of filing suit, failure of the plaintiff’s attorney to sue both the bar and the bar patron who murdered while intoxicated was malpractice.
