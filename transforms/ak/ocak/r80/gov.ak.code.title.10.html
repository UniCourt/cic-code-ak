It clearly expressed the legislative intent, was to be enforced as it read, and was not to be modified or extended by judicial construction so as to enable one to avoid the consequences of noncompliance with its express terms.

Because the same legislature enacted ch. 166, SLA 1988, which enacted AS 10.06 and repealed AS 10.05, the provisions of sec. 1, ch. 148, SLA 1988 were incorporated into AS 10.06.210(1) in 1988 to carry out legislative intent.

       Payments under plan of a village corporation organized under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act for distributing corporate assets to certain shareholders were “preferences” or “privileges” based on stock ownership and violated the rights of excluded shareholders. Hanson v. Kake Tribal Corp., 939 P.2d 1320 (Alaska 1997).

       Trial court’s findings supported the native village corporation’s claims that neither the distribution of longshoring employment opportunities nor the payment of workers’ travel costs constituted discriminatory distribution of corporate wealth or dividends in violation of AS 10.06.305(b), 10.06.308, 10.06.313, or the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act §§ 7(h)(1)(A), 8(c).

      In case of default in the payment of an installment or call when payment is due, the corporation may proceed to collect the amount due as any debt due the corporation. The bylaws may prescribe other remedies for failure to pay installments or calls that become due. No remedy working a forfeiture of a subscription, or of the amounts paid on a subscription, may be declared against a subscriber unless the amount due remains unpaid for a period of 20 days after written demand has been made. If mailed, written demand is considered to be made when it is deposited in the United States mail in a sealed envelope addressed to the subscriber at the last post office address known to the corporation, with postage prepaid. On a sale of shares by reason of forfeiture, the excess of proceeds realized over the amount due and unpaid on the shares shall be paid to the delinquent subscriber or to the legal representative of the subscriber.

This record date may not be more than 60 days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 20 days before the date on which the particular action requiring the determination of shareholders is to be taken. If the stock transfer books are not closed and a record date is not fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders or for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the board declaring the dividend is adopted, is the record date for the determination of shareholders.

        Right to inspect. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A shareholder was not deprived of his statutory right to inspect the records of a corporation by virtue of a contract requiring him to exchange his shares for stock in another corporation prior to the date of the demand for inspection since the shareholder had disregarded the agreement and had apparently remained a shareholder of record in the corporation. Knaebel v. Heiner, 673 P.2d 885 (Alaska 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Summary judgment was appropriate on the former directors’ claims made under subsection (b) of this section and
   10.06.450(d) because the former directors did not attempt to inspect and copy the 2005 shareholder records as required by these statutes.
   Henrichs v. Chugach Alaska Corp., 260 P.3d 1036 (Alaska 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Phrase “books and records of account” used in the statute must extend beyond mere annual reports in order to give meaning to the statutory language and avoid statutory surplusage; the legislature intended for the shareholder inspection requirement to have effect beyond the annual-reporting requirement because both requirements were part of the same statutory section in the original 1957 statute. Pederson v. Arctic Slope Reg'l Corp., 331 P.3d 384 (Alaska 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporation-maintained books and records of account fall within the meaning of the statute because the electronic nature of the corporation’s books had no bearing on the legal issue in the case, which was the scope of “books and records of account” under the statute; if the corporation was correct that a shareholder was entitled to only annual and proxy reports along with the minutes, then it had to find support on alternative grounds. Pederson v. Arctic Slope Reg'l Corp., 331 P.3d 384 (Alaska 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       When copies of the shareholder list are distributed on a by-request basis only after receipt of shareholder requests containing confidentiality clauses, that information does not enter the public domain like an annual statement of executive remuneration mailed to all shareholders. Pederson v. Arctic Slope Reg'l Corp., 421 P.3d 58 (Alaska), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 139 S. Ct. 427, 202 L. Ed. 2d 327 (U.S. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Electronic records. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Electronic records are included within the statutory definition of “books and records of account”; even if electronic accounting records are somehow less accessible than traditional printed ledgers, the inaccessibility of documents is not relevant to the legal determination of what documents fall within “books and records of account” because the corporation cannot fail to keep books and thus avoid the statutory penalty. Pederson v. Arctic Slope Reg'l Corp., 331 P.3d 384 (Alaska 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Mootness. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a shareholder offered for sale or improperly used the shareholder list as contemplated by this section was a moot issue where the shareholder's offer for sale email was sent more than two years before the court's decision was issued, at which point it could no longer provide the corporation a defense to an action for penalties under AS 10.06.430(c), there was no indication that the shareholder had again sued the corporation for violation and penalties under subsection (c) of this section, and thus, the court's declaratory judgment could no longer provide the corporation a defense to an action for penalties under subsection (c) of this section. Pederson v. Arctic Slope Reg'l Corp., 421 P.3d 58 (Alaska), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 139 S. Ct. 427, 202 L. Ed. 2d 327 (U.S. 2018).

      <p>
       <b>
        Claim abandoned. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Claims alleging refusal to disclose shareholder information were moot and abandoned because the claimant was no longer a director, and because he did not identify the shareholder disclosure claim in his motion opposing dismissal of his remaining claims after a summary judgment. Rude v. Cook Inlet Region, Inc., 294 P.3d 76 (Alaska 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Confidentiality agreement. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporation may unilaterally demand a reasonable confidentiality agreement because there is no indication that the statute prohibits such a demand; the legislative history indicates that the legislature may have intended to give corporations just such a tool. Pederson v. Arctic Slope Reg'l Corp., 331 P.3d 384 (Alaska 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no suggestion in case law that confidentiality agreements should not be available when the request is for a shareholder list. Pederson v. Arctic Slope Reg'l Corp., 421 P.3d 58 (Alaska), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 139 S. Ct. 427, 202 L. Ed. 2d 327 (U.S. 2018).

      <p>
       <b>
        Minutes. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court correctly interpreted “minutes” because a corporation’s duty to disclose “minutes” was satisfied when it provided a shareholder with post hoc descriptions of what was discussed and decided in board meetings but withheld presentations and reports made to the board; “minutes” does not ordinarily encompass presentations or reports made to the board but rather merely requires a record of the subjects discussed and actions taken at the meeting, which must be faithfully recorded. Pederson v. Arctic Slope Reg'l Corp., 331 P.3d 384 (Alaska 2014).

A shareholder who does not meet the requirements of this section may be allowed in the discretion of the court to maintain the action on a preliminary showing to and determination by the court, by motion and after a hearing at which the court considers evidence, by affidavit or testimony, as it considers material, that

If the court is satisfied that the petitioners are disinterested, independent, and informed it shall then exercise an independent appraisal of the plaintiff ’s action to determine whether, considering the welfare of the corporation and relevant issues of public policy, it should dismiss the action.

The amount of the security may be increased or decreased from time to time in the discretion of the court upon a showing that the security has become inadequate or excessive. The corporation or other defendants may have recourse to the security in an amount as the court may determine upon the termination of the derivative action, whether or not the court finds the action was brought without reasonable cause.

If the court directs notice to be given, it shall determine which of the parties to the action shall bear the expense of giving the notice in an amount the court determines to be reasonable in the circumstances. The amount shall be awarded as special costs of the action.

This subsection does not apply to a judgment rendered only for the benefit of injured shareholders and limited to a recovery of the loss or damage sustained by them.

       — It was no plain error to find a former husband violated corporate law by selling real property owned by a corporation of which the former husband and his former wife were sole shareholders and directors without notice to the former wife because the former husband did not explain how this did not breach the former husband's duties of good faith and to act honestly and diligently.

       A former husband violated corporate law by selling real property owned by a corporation of which he and his former wife were sole shareholders and directors when it was done without notice to the wife.

      <p>
       Trial court properly denied shareholders’ request for nominal damages because proxy disclosure violations committed by the corporation and the individual members of its board of directors occurred inadvertently as a result of their good-faith reliance on expert advice, and did not amount to a fiduciary breach.

      <p>
       In a corporation’s action against a former director for specific breach of fiduciary duty, even if the trial court erred in refusing to repeat the “reliance on counsel” language in this section in successive jury instructions, the error was harmless because no evidence was provided that a proxy solicitation letter was approved by counsel, or that the director relied on counsel’s advice in authorizing the letter.

        Factors in determining bar of director. —

      </p>
      <p>
       In reaching the determination to bar a director under this section, the following factors should be considered: (1) The egregiousness of the underlying violation; (2) the director’s past record of misconduct; (3) the director’s role or position at the time of the violation; (4) the director’s degree of scienter; (5) the director’s economic stake in the violation; (6) the likelihood that the misconduct will recur; and (7) reason to suspect that shareholder democracy will be insufficient to prevent reelection of an unfit director. Martinez v. Cape Fox Corp., 113 P.3d 1226 (Alaska 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a corporation’s action against a former director for breach of fiduciary duty, banning the director from serving on the corporation’s board of directors for five years was proper; the trial court applied the correct statutory standard and carefully discussed each of the seven factors set out in

Indemnification may include reimbursement for expenses and attorney fees actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of the action if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation. Indemnification may not be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which the person has been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of the person’s duty to the corporation except to the extent that the court in which the action was brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for expenses that the court considers proper.

   A statement relating to indemnification contained in the articles or bylaws of a corporation on July 1, 1989 may limit the indemnification permitted by AS 10.06.490 if the statement expressly states that indemnification is limited.”

Because these subsections should have been placed in this section rather than AS 10.06.960, they were renumbered as (d) and (e) of this section in 1997, at which time “(d) of this section” was substituted for “(l) of this section” in subsection (e).

      At each meeting for which notice is given under AS 10.06.544 a vote of the shareholders shall be taken on the proposed plan of merger, consolidation, or exchange. Each outstanding share of each corporation may vote on the proposed plan whether or not the share has voting rights under the articles of the corporation.

If a class of shares of a corporation is entitled to vote on the plan as a class, the plan is approved if it receives the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of each class of shares entitled to vote on the plan as a class and the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the total shares entitled to vote on the plan. A class of shares of a corporation is entitled to vote as a class if a plan contains a provision that, if contained in a proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation, would entitle the class of shares to vote as a class and, in the case of an exchange, if the class is included in the exchange.

       A shareholder electing to exercise a right to dissent shall file with the corporation, before or at the meeting of shareholders at which the proposed corporate action is submitted to a vote, a written objection to the proposed corporate action. The objection must include a notice of election to dissent, the shareholder’s name and residence address, the number and classes of shares as to which the shareholder dissents, and a demand for payment of the fair value of the shares if the action is taken. A shareholder to whom the corporation did not give notice of the meeting in accordance with this chapter is not required to make the objection provided in this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t10c06a08s10.06.576ol1b">
       Within 10 days after the shareholders’ vote authorizing the action, the corporation shall given written notice of the authorization to each shareholder who filed written objection or from whom written objection was not required. The corporation may consider that a shareholder who voted for the proposed action has elected not to enforce a right of dissent under this chapter, and need not give notice to the shareholder.
      </li>
      <li id="t10c06a08s10.06.576ol1c">
       Within 20 days after notice has been given under (b) of this section, a shareholder from whom written objection was not required under (a) of this section and who elects to dissent shall file with the corporation a written notice of the election, stating the shareholder’s name and residence address, the number and classes of shares as to which the shareholder dissents, and a demand for payment of the fair value of the shares. A shareholder who elects to dissent from a merger under AS 10.06.532, a consolidation under AS 10.06.534, a share exchange under AS 10.06.540, a transaction authorized under AS 10.06.562, or a sale of assets under AS 10.06.568 shall file a written notice of the election to dissent within 20 days after the merger plan, consolidation plan, share exchange plan, or sale of assets resolution has been mailed to the shareholder.

       A merger, consolidation, or exchange is considered completed within the meaning of this chapter on the effective date determined in accordance with AS 10.06.560; a transaction under AS 10.06.568 is completed within the meaning of this chapter when the corporation has received the consideration specified in the board resolution that was submitted to the shareholders in accordance with that section.
      </li>
      <li id="t10c06a08s10.06.576ol1e">
       Upon completion of the corporation action, the shareholder shall cease to have the rights of a shareholder except the right to be paid the fair value of the shares as to which the dissenter’s rights were perfected under this chapter. A notice of election may be withdrawn by the shareholder at any time before an acceptance under AS 10.06.578(f), but in no case later than 60 days from the date of completion of the corporate action, except that the time for withdrawing a notice of election shall be extended for 60 days from the date an offer is made, if the corporation fails to make a timely offer under AS 10.06.578. After the time for withdrawal has expired, withdrawal of a notice of election requires the written consent of the corporation. In order to be effective, withdrawal of a notice of election must be accompanied by the return to the corporation of an advance payment made to the shareholder as provided in AS 10.06.578. If a notice of election is withdrawn, if the corporate action is rescinded, if a court determines that the shareholder is not entitled to the right to dissent, or if the shareholder otherwise loses the right to dissent, the shareholder shall not have the right to receive payment for the shares and shall be reinstated to all rights as a shareholder that were effective on the date of the completion of the corporate action. The rights to which the shareholder is reinstated include intervening preemptive rights and the right to payment of an intervening dividend or other distribution. If an intervening right has expired or if a dividend or distribution that is not in cash has been completed, the corporation may elect to pay the shareholder the fair value of the shares in cash at the value, as determined by the board, at the time of the expiration or completion. The election to pay the value in cash shall be without prejudice to a corporate proceeding that has occurred in the interim.
      </li>
      <li id="t10c06a08s10.06.576ol1f">
       At the time of filing the notice of election to dissent, or within 30 days after the shareholder has filed the notice, the shareholder shall submit to the corporation, or to its transfer agent, the certificates representing the shares for which payment is claimed, if certificates have been issued. The corporation or its transfer agent shall note conspicuously on the certificates, or on a separate document if certificates have not been issued for the shares, that a notice of election has been filed, and shall return the certificates or the separate document to the shareholder or to the person who submitted them on the shareholder’s behalf. Unless a court, for good cause shown, otherwise directs, a shareholder who fails to comply with this subsection loses the right to dissent granted by this chapter, if the corporation gives written notice that the right to dissent will be lost to the shareholder within 45 days from the date that the shareholder filed the notice of election to dissent. If the corporation fails to exercise this notice option in a timely manner, the shareholder retains the right to dissent granted by this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t10c06a08s10.06.576ol1g">
       When a share of a dissenting shareholder under (f) of this section is transferred, the new certificate must bear a notation similar to that made under (f) of this section and state the name of the original dissenting holder of the shares, or, if the share is an uncertificated share, the corporation must give the transferee a written notice stating that a notice of election to dissent has been filed and giving the name of the original dissenting holder. A transferee acquires only the rights in the corporation that the original dissenting shareholder had at the time of transfer.

The fair value shall be determined on the basis of the liquidation value, taking into account the possibility of sale of the entire business as a going concern in a liquidation. The election of the corporation to purchase may be made by the approval of the outstanding shares excluding shares held by the moving parties.

The order shall prescribe the time and manner of producing evidence if evidence is required. The award of the appraisers or of a majority of the appraisers, when confirmed by the court, is final and conclusive upon all parties. The court shall enter a decree that provides in the alternative for winding up and dissolution of the corporation unless payment is made for the shares within the time specified by the decree. If the purchasing parties do not make payment for the shares within the time specified, judgment shall be entered against the purchasing parties and the surety or sureties on the bond for the amount of the expenses, including attorney fees, of the moving parties. A shareholder aggrieved by the action of the court may appeal.

In the case of an appeal, the purchasing parties shall pay to the moving parties the value of the shares and costs of appraisal as fixed on appeal. On receiving payment or the tender of payment as determined by the court, the moving parties shall transfer their shares to the purchasing parties.

        Settlement requiring fair value determination. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Settlement agreement for a buyout to avoid involuntary corporate dissolution expressly authorized the superior court to review the appraisal process by providing broad authority to enforce all terms, which included a term requiring a fair value determination on the statutory basis of liquidation value. Thus, the court had authority to remand to the appraisers with instructions to deduct capital gains tax liabilities and other liquidation expenses in determining fair value. Calais Co. v. Ivy, 303 P.3d 410 (Alaska 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly instructed the appraisal panel to calculate “fair value” as defined by the statute and the terms of a settlement agreement because the agreement required the appraisers to consider the possibility of a going concern sale and then to determine which valuation option would return a higher value; the shareholder's proposed instruction would have made those determinations by judicial decree, and thus, it was properly rejected by the superior court. Ivy v. Calais Co., 397 P.3d 267 (Alaska 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly enforced a settlement agreement between a shareholder and a closely held corporation because the shareholder did not show any error in the appraisal panel's determination of the corporation's fair value; the superior court's role under the agreement was to determine whether the appraisers understood and completed the contractually assigned task, and the report the panel issued complied with its instructions to describe the reasoning behind the conclusion as to “fair value.” Ivy v. Calais Co., 397 P.3d 267 (Alaska 2017).

If the item mailed to the registered agent is returned to the commissioner, the commissioner shall mail the item by first class mail to the president of the corporation at the last known address for the president shown on the records of the commissioner. If the name and address of the president are not shown on the records of the commissioner, the commissioner shall mail the item by first class mail to an officer shown on the records of the commissioner at the last known address shown on the records of the commissioner. If the name and address of an officer of the corporation are not shown on the records of the commissioner, the commissioner shall mail the item by first class mail to a member of the board of directors of the corporation at the last known address shown on the records of the commissioner. If the name and address of an officer or board member are not shown on the records of the commissioner, the commissioner is not required to mail the item again. If the item mailed to the president, other officer, or board member is returned to the commissioner, the commissioner is not required to mail the item again. If the address shown on the records of the commissioner for a mailing after the initial certified mailing is not different from the address for the previous mailing, the commissioner is not required to mail the item to the same address, but shall mail the item to the next required addressee whose address is different from the address for the returned mailing, and, if none of the mailings required after a returned mailing has an address that is different from the address for the returned mailing, the commissioner is not required to mail the item again. In this subsection, “item” means the notice required by (b) of this section or the certificate of involuntary dissolution under (d) of this section.

The time in which to present claims may not be less than four nor more than six months after the first publication of notice to creditors unless it appears by affidavit that there are no claims, in which case the time may not be less than three months.

      <p>
       This section permits a suit against a dissolved corporation for an action that accrues following dissolution; the 1988 amendments to Alaska’s survival statute eliminated the specific language that a claim must exist prior to dissolution.

      <p>
       The legislature’s removal from this section of the statutory language limiting claims to those that arose before dissolution did not signify a return to the common law rule, under which neither pending nor future actions could be maintained or brought against a dissolved corporation. Gossman v. Greatland Directional Drilling, Inc., 973 P.2d 93 (Alaska 1999).

      <p>
       This section does not provide any limitations period within which claims against a dissolved corporation must be brought; the omission of a limitation provision and legislative comments imply that the Alaska legislature intended to allow suits against dissolved corporations for an indefinite time. Gossman v. Greatland Directional Drilling, Inc., 973 P.2d 93 (Alaska 1999).

        The creditor in a pending action has two alternatives:
       </b>
       (1) to prosecute the pending action to judgment against the corporation, or (2) to discontinue the pending action and submit his claim to the receiver.
   The latter would be the more expeditious course.
   If he resorts to the first alternative then, so far as the receivership assets are concerned, the judgment serves only to liquidate the claim and must be presented in the receivership action.
   It can in no way result in a preference, nor can execution issue against the receivership assets. Grocery Supply v. McKinley Park Servs., 128 F. Supp. 694, 15 Alaska 469 (D. Alaska 1955).

       The words “transact business,” as used in AS 10.05.642 (now see this section), encompassed all those activities which would subject a foreign corporation to the jurisdiction of state courts, when measured by the outer limits of the due process clause of the federal constitution. Northern Supply v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., 397 P.2d 1013 (Alaska 1965); Stephenson v. Duriron Co., 401 P.2d 423 (Alaska), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 956, 86 S. Ct. 431, 15 L. Ed. 2d 360 (U.S. 1965); Jonz v. Garrett/Airesearch Corp., 490 P.2d 1197 (Alaska 1971).

       A foreign corporation carried on or transacted business when it entered into a distribution agreement with plaintiff for the purpose of expanding its equipment sales in the construction industry in this state, and when, pursuant to that agreement, one of its scrapers was sold with the aid of its representatives, and when parts and other supplies were furnished to plaintiff. Northern Supply v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., 397 P.2d 1013 (Alaska 1965).

        Business transacted need not be such as to require certificate of authority. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The broad language “or not authorized to transact business but doing so” shows the legislature’s intent to expand the scope of jurisdiction to cover situations where a foreign corporation was in fact transacting business in the state, whether or not the business was of such a nature as to require the corporation to obtain a certificate of authority under state law. Northern Supply v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., 397 P.2d 1013 (Alaska 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not the intent of the legislature that a foreign corporation should be allowed to escape service of process and that residents of the state should be compelled to go into foreign jurisdictions to vindicate rights arising out of business transacted by a foreign corporation in the state, simply because such corporation was not doing sufficient business to require it to obtain a certificate of authority. Northern Supply v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., 397 P.2d 1013 (Alaska 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       A foreign corporation could very well be transacting business of such a nature that it was not required to obtain a certificate of authority under AS 10.05.600 (now see AS 10.06.718), but that the same business could be sufficient under AS 10.05.642 (now see AS 10.06.765) to subject the foreign corporation to the jurisdiction of Alaska’s courts. Stephenson v. Duriron Co., 401 P.2d 423 (Alaska), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 956, 86 S. Ct. 431, 15 L. Ed. 2d 360 (U.S. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       The activities mentioned in AS 10.05.600 (now see AS 10.06.718) pertained only to the transaction of business as it related to the power of the state to require the foreign corporation to obtain a certificate of authority to transact business in the state. AS 10.05.600 did not pertain to those activities which might subject a foreign corporation to the jurisdiction of Alaska courts under AS 10.05.642 (now see this section). Weaver v. O'Meara Motor Co., 452 P.2d 87 (Alaska 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       A foreign corporation could be “transacting business” of such a nature that it would not be required to obtain a certificate of authority under AS 10.05.597 (now see AS 10.06.705) and AS 10.05.690 (now see AS 10.06.713) yet still be subject to service of process under AS 10.05.642 (now see this section), the key phrase of which is “transact business.” Kachemak Seafoods v. Century Airlines, 641 P.2d 213 (Alaska 1982).

      </p>
      <p>
       The doctrine of “estimate of the inconveniences” which would result to the foreign corporation from a trial away from its home has been recognized as one of the tests relevant in determining whether due process would be violated by the exercise of local jurisdiction. Stephenson v. Duriron Co., 401 P.2d 423 (Alaska), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 956, 86 S. Ct. 431, 15 L. Ed. 2d 360 (U.S. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       If applied as a fixed test, the dollar volume of business done in the state as compared with the total dollar volume of business done in all areas could result in a given nonresident corporation being held not to have transacted a sufficient percentage of its total business in the state to have established the minimum contacts, whereas another nonresident corporation with the same dollar volume of sales in the state, but with a smaller total of gross sales in all areas, might be held to have established the minimum contacts, based on the fact that a greater percentage of its total sales was transacted in the state. Stephenson v. Duriron Co., 401 P.2d 423 (Alaska), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 956, 86 S. Ct. 431, 15 L. Ed. 2d 360 (U.S. 1965).

      <p>
       The doing of a given volume of business is not the only way in which a nonresident can establish the “minimum contacts” with the state sufficient to support jurisdiction. Stephenson v.

       The fact that some of the purchases were made from independent middlemen, or that someone other than the manufacturer caused the product to be shipped into the state, are not controlling factors.

       AS 10.05.720 (now see this section) permitted a corporation to cure its failure to comply with the statutory requirements so long as it did so before the statute of limitations on the underlying action expired. Gratrix v. Pine Tree, 677 P.2d 1264 (Alaska 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Dismissal of a corporate plaintiff’s action for failure to pay its corporate tax and file its annual report as required by AS 10.05.720 (now see this section) did not operate as an adjudication on the merits so as to bar a subsequent action brought before the expiration of the limitations period on the underlying action, on the ground of res judicata. Blake v. Gilbert, 702 P.2d 631 (Alaska 1985), overruled, Bibo v. Jeffrey's Restaurant, 770 P.2d 290 (Alaska 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Civ. R. 41(b), a corporation’s lack of capacity to maintain an action due to nonpayment of taxes is considered a matter in abatement, which only results in a dismissal without prejudice and does not bar a subsequent action.
   The “lack of jurisdiction” exception to Civ. R. 41(b) is interpreted broadly. Blake v. Gilbert, 702 P.2d 631 (Alaska 1985), overruled, Bibo v. Jeffrey's Restaurant, 770 P.2d 290 (Alaska 1989).

       Allegations at least suggestive that defendant-directors cooperated with mortgagees to effect a fraudulent sale of the property of the corporation and deliberately allowed the corporation to become defunct in order to prevent it and the stockholders from bringing any action to secure redress from them and others involved, reveal the existence of a cause of action of the type recognized by equity as an exception to the operation of the statutes prohibiting suit by or on behalf of a delinquent corporation.

      The commissioner may, within one year after a filing, and after written notice to the corporation or individual making the filing, cancel a certificate issued or filing accepted under this chapter, on any ground existing at the time of issuance or filing for which the commissioner could have originally refused to issue the certificate or accept the filing. The notice of cancellation must state the reason for the cancellation. A corporation or individual may request a hearing conducted by the office of administrative hearings (AS 44.64.010) within 90 days after receipt of the notice. Cancellation becomes final if the corporation or individual does not request a hearing within 90 days after receipt of notice. Notice of cancellation shall be sent by certified mail with return receipt requested. If the return receipt is not received by the department within a reasonable time and the department has made diligent inquiry as to the address of the corporation, notice may be made by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the vicinity of the registered office of the corporation or the address of the individual who made the filing, and the cancellation becomes final 60 days after publication of the notice if the person or corporation does not request a hearing.

       Disbursement of funds to elder shareholders from a settlement trust established by a Native regional corporation was not illegal as a discriminatory distribution under AS 10.06.305(b) since that provision was preempted by Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Broad v. Sealaska Corp., 85 F.3d 422 (9th Cir. Alaska 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1092, 117 S. Ct. 768, 136 L. Ed. 2d 714 (U.S. 1997).

       Definition of “crime of violence” in

       , — U.S. —, 135 S. Ct. 2551, 192 L.

    Declaration of public policy that cooperatives are not in restraint of trade.

     <p>
      It is the public policy of the state to encourage the efficient production and distribution of agricultural and other products derived from its natural resources or labor resources.
   Accordingly, a cooperative that operates in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and that does not, during its fiscal year, market products for nonmember patrons in an amount greater in value than the products marketed for its members is not a conspiracy or combination in restraint of trade, or an illegal monopoly. The contracts of a cooperative authorized by this chapter, whether or not required by the cooperative as a condition of membership or of doing business with the cooperative, may not be construed as an unlawful restraint of trade, or as part of a conspiracy or combination to accomplish an improper or illegal purpose or act.

       Alaska Department of Revenue’s decision to grant a permit to a nonprofit organization’s operation of a free-bicycle loan program that was supported by gaming proceeds survived rational basis scrutiny, where business owner failed to show how applicable gaming statutes impinged on the business owner’s rights, and, moreover, the state identified a rational purpose for the gaming laws.

      <p>
       There is nothing in this chapter which would prevent a nonprofit corporation organized thereunder from owning a public utility which was not operated or managed as a cooperative.
   June 7, 1976, Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       An electrical utility owned and operated by a regional electrical authority would continue to qualify for the broad exemption from the Alaska Public Utilities Commission Act, AS 42.05, available to political subdivisions under AS 42.05.711(b) once the regional electrical authority had completed its proposed organization as a nonprofit corporation pursuant to this chapter.
   June 7, 1976, Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although there is no other express language in the Electric and Telephone Cooperative Act, AS 10.25, which purports to make it the exclusive means of organizing nonprofit cooperative associations for the development of utility services, this would certainly be a reasonable inference based upon AS 10.25.620 and upon the exclusionary language of this section which eliminates the nonprofit corporation as an alternative. June 7, 1976, Op. Att’y Gen.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fish hatchery established as a nonprofit corporation can expand its business to other lawful purposes including processing fish harvested by others, provided that the profits from these activities are used for the business and are not distributed to members, directors or officers; for example, the money could be used to pay for the overall operations of the corporation and to establish reserves. June 11, 1984, Op. Att’y Gen.

       A church organized as a nonprofit corporation that desires to avoid the use of proxy voting may enact an article or bylaw prohibiting or limiting the practice. Herning v. Eason, 739 P.2d 167 (Alaska 1987).

      </p>
      <p>
       The 1968 amendment to this section permitting proxy voting is a purely procedural change that may be retroactively applied to a church incorporated in 1947 under the forerunner of this chapter and authorizes proxy voting absent a contrary provision in the corporate articles or bylaws. Herning v. Eason, 739 P.2d 167 (Alaska 1987).

        Evidence held insufficient to prohibit proxy voting. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a church asked the supreme court to take judicial notice of Pendleton’s Church Manual and the constitution of the 1985 Southern Baptist Convention as evidence of the religious basis for prohibiting proxy voting, it was held that this evidence alone is insufficient to support the conclusion that congregationalist doctrine permits voting only by members physically present at business meetings; as no other evidence was offered below, the court concluded that the church’s free exercise defense must fail. Herning v. Eason, 739 P.2d 167 (Alaska 1987).

      The dissolution of a corporation either by (1) the issuance of a certificate of dissolution by the commissioner, or (2) a decree of the court when the court has not liquidated the assets and business of the corporation as provided in this chapter, or (3) by expiration of its period of duration, does not take away or impair a remedy available to or against the corporation, its directors, officers, or members, for a right or claim existing, or a liability incurred, before dissolution if an action or other proceeding is commenced within two years after the date of dissolution.
   The action or proceeding by or against the corporation may be prosecuted or defended by the corporation in its corporate name.
   The members, directors, and officers may take appropriate action to protect the remedy, right, or claim.
   If the corporation was dissolved by the expiration of its period of duration, it may amend its articles of incorporation at any time during the two year period in order to extend its period of duration.

     <p>
      If a dissolved corporation is the owner of real or personal property, or claims an interest in or lien upon real or personal property, the corporation through its board of directors continues to exist for five years after the date of dissolution for the purpose of conveying, transferring, or releasing the real or personal property or interest in or lien upon the property. In addition, a dissolved corporation through its board of directors continues to exist for the purpose of being made a party in an action or proceeding arising before dissolution and involving the title to real or personal property or an interest in it.
   The action or proceeding may be instituted and maintained in the same manner as before the dissolution of the corporation. This section does not affect or suspend a statute of limitations applicable to a claim.
   For the purpose of service of process, notice, or demand within the prescribed time following dissolution, the commissioner is an agent of the dissolved corporation upon whom service may be made in the manner prescribed in AS 10.06.175(b).

   A foreign corporation may not procure a certificate of authority to transact business in the state that a corporation organized under this chapter is not permitted to transact.
   A foreign corporation may not be denied a certificate of authority because the laws of the state or country under which it is organized governing its organization and internal affairs differ from the laws of the state.
   Nothing in this chapter authorizes the state to regulate the organization or the internal affairs of a foreign corporation.

The former introductory clause was designated as subsection (a) and minor word changes were made to reflect the reorganization. Former paragraphs (1) — (3) were redesignated as subsections (b) — (d) respectively.

      A mortgage, deed of trust, or other instrument executed by a cooperative, which affects real and personal property and which is recorded in the real property records in the city, borough, or other recording districts in which the property is located or is to be located has the same effect as if recorded, filed, or indexed as provided by law in the proper office in the city, borough, or other recording district as a mortgage of personal property.
   All after-acquired property of the cooperative described or referred to as being mortgaged or pledged in a mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument is subject to the lien thereof immediately upon the acquisition of such property by the cooperative, whether or not the property was in existence at the time of the execution of the mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument.
   Recordation of such mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument constitutes notice and has the same effect with respect to after-acquired property as it has under the laws relating to recordation of property owned by the cooperative at the time of the execution of the mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument and described in it or referred to as being mortgaged or pledged thereby.
   The lien of such mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument upon personal property after its recordation continues for the period of time specified in the instrument without refiling or the filing of a renewal certificate, affidavit or other supplemental information required by the laws relating to the renewal, maintenance or extension of liens upon personal property.

       Although there is no other express language in the Electric and Telephone Cooperative Act, AS 10.25, which purports to make it the exclusive means of organizing nonprofit cooperative associations for the development of utility services, this would certainly be a reasonable inference based upon this section and upon the exclusionary language of AS 10.20.005, which eliminates the nonprofit corporation as an alternative.

       The legislature, in creating regional electrical authorities under AS 18.57, anticipated that they might supplant the function of municipal and cooperative utilities in many areas of the state.

      A cemetery association or nonprofit cemetery corporation may by its bylaws provide that a stated percentage of the money realized from the sale of cemetery lots and donations constitutes an irreducible fund, which may be invested in the manner or loaned upon the securities the association or corporation considers proper.
   The interest or income from the irreducible fund provided for in a bylaw, or as much as may be necessary, shall be devoted exclusively to (1) the preservation and embellishment of the grounds, buildings, and property of the association or corporation that are related to the operation of a cemetery; (2) the preservation and embellishment of cemetery lots and space in buildings or on grounds sold to the association or corporation that are related to the operation of a cemetery; or (3) the payment of interest and principal of debts authorized by the association or corporation for the purchase of land or equipment or for the construction or improvement of buildings that are related to the operation of a cemetery. If a bylaw has been enacted for the creation of an irreducible fund, the percentage stated in the bylaw may not be reduced.

      A registered business name may be renewed every five years if an application for renewal is filed. An application for renewal must set out the facts required in an original application for registration and be accompanied by a renewal fee to be established by the department by regulation. An application for renewal may be filed between October 1 and December 31 of any year. The renewal of the registration extends the registration for the following five calendar years.

      Opinions of attorney general. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     A Limited Liability Company (LLC) may lawfully apply for and receive a “liquor license” in the State of Alaska, provided the conditions of the current statute and regulations governing liquor licenses are met. For purposes of the liquor license statutes and regulations an LLC will be treated essentially the same as a partnership. December 6, 1995 Op. Atty Gen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Neither an LLC nor its member is exempt from any liability with regard to the liquor laws in Title 4 of the Alaska Statutes and the ABC Board regulations. December 6, 1995 Op. Atty Gen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The duties and responsibilities of licensees noted in AS 04.11.370(a)(5), AS 04.11.370(a)(11), AS 04.16.150, and AS 04.21.030 would not be changed because the entity holding a license would be an LLC. In statutory interpretation, specific terms control over general terms. Therefore, the mere fact that an entity is an LLC does not relieve either the LLC or its members from compliance with the provisions of Title 4 relating to liquor laws. December 6, 1995 Op. Atty Gen.
    </p>
    <p>
     An LLC that is properly organized under AS 10.50, meets the criteria specified in AS 36.30.170(b)(1) — (3), and whose manager is a resident of Alaska, would qualify for the Alaska bidder preference under AS 36.30.170. March 4, 1999 Op. Att’y Gen.

       A limited liability company may indemnify a person who was, is, or is threatened to be made a party to a completed, pending, or threatened action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, other than an action by or in the right of the company, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a manager, managing member, employee, or agent of the company, or is or was serving at the request of the company as a manager, managing member, employee, or agent of another limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. Indemnification may include reimbursement of expenses, attorney fees, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the action or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the company, and, with respect to a criminal action or proceeding, the person had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. The termination of an action or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the company, and, with respect to a criminal action or proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.

       A limited liability company may indemnify a person who was, is, or is threatened to be made a party to a completed, pending, or threatened action by or in the right of the company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a manager, managing member, employee, or agent of the company, or is or was serving at the request of the company as a manager, managing member, employee, or agent of another limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. Indemnification may include reimbursement for expenses and attorney fees actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of the action if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the company. Indemnification may not be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which the person has been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of the person’s duty to the company except to the extent that the court in which the action was brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for expenses that the court considers proper.

       Unless otherwise ordered by a court, indemnification under (a) or (b) of this section may only be made by a company upon a determination that indemnification of the manager, managing member, employee, or agent is proper in the circumstances because the manager, managing member, employee, or agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set out in (a) and (b) of this section.

The original certificate of dissolution shall be placed in the department files and a copy of it mailed to the company as provided by (f) of this section. Upon the issuance of the certificate of involuntary dissolution, the existence of the company ceases, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, and its name shall be available to use and may be adopted by another company on a date that is six months or later after the dissolution.

If the item mailed to the registered office is returned to the department, the commissioner shall mail the item by first class mail to the registered agent of the limited liability company at the last known address of the registered agent shown on the records of the commissioner. If the item mailed to the registered agent is returned to the department, the commissioner shall mail the item by first class mail to the manager or the managing member of the limited liability company at the last known address for the manager or the managing member shown on the records of the commissioner. If the name and address of the manager or managing members are not shown on the records of the commissioner, the commissioner is not required to mail the notice to the manager or managing member. If the item mailed to the manager or managing member is returned to the department, the commissioner is not required to mail the item again. If the address shown on the records of the commissioner for a mailing after the initial certified mailing is not different from the address for the previous mailing, the commissioner is not required to mail the item to the same address, but shall mail the item to the next required addressee whose address is different from the address for the returned mailing, and, if none of the mailings required after a returned mailing has an address that is different from the address for the returned mailing, the commissioner is not required to mail the item again. In this subsection, “item” means the notice required under (b) of this section or the certificate of involuntary dissolution issued under (d) of this section.
