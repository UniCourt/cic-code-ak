      <p>
       Section 1, ch. 82, SLA 1975, which amended this section [added the former third sentence, which was repealed in 1980] and purported to authorize legislative “meddling” in the exercise of an executive power, i.e., the appointment of executive officials, was unconstitutional because it was violative of separation of powers requirements. Bradner v. Hammond, 553 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1976).

      <p>
       <b>
        Appointment of executive officers is an executive function,
       </b>
       for without such a power, the responsibility for executing executive duties would be diffused and the goal of separation of branches of government, avoiding too great a concentration of power in one branch, would be defeated. Bradner v. Hammond, 553 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1976).

       Confirmation is not a distinct legislative power, but rather a part of the executive power of appointment which has in turn been delegated in some specific instances by constitution to the legislative branch of government. Bradner v. Hammond, 553 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1976).

      </p>
      <p>
       The lack of ambiguity in sections 25 and 26 of Art. III, Alaska Const., mandate that this court interpret these express provisions as embodying not only the maximum parameters of the delegation of the executive appointive authority through legislative confirmation, but that they delineate the full extent of the constitution’s express grant to the legislative branch of checks on the governor’s power to appoint subordinate executive officers. Bradner v. Hammond, 553 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1976).

      Except as otherwise provided in a law relating to the positions or memberships on a specific board or commission, appointment to a position or membership shall be made in the following manner:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39c05s39.05.080ol11">
       Each governor shall present to the legislature the names of the persons appointed by that governor; each governor may present the name of a person appointed by a previous governor; only presentment that occurs during the time that the legislature is in regular session constitutes presentment under this section. The governor shall, within the first 15 days after the legislature convenes in regular session, present to the legislature for confirmation the names of the following persons: (A) persons appointed to a position or membership who have not previously been confirmed by the legislature, and (B) persons to be appointed to fill a position or membership the term of which will expire on or before March 1 during that session of the legislature. If an appointment is made after the first 15 days after the convening of the regular session but while the legislature is in regular session, the governor shall immediately present to the legislature for confirmation the name of the person appointed.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c05s39.05.080ol12">
       When appointments are presented to the legislature for confirmation,
       <ol type="A">
        <li id="t39c05s39.05.080ol12A">
         the presiding officer of each house shall assign the name of each appointee to a standing committee of that house for a hearing, report, and recommendation; standing committees of the two houses assigned the same person’s name for consideration may meet jointly to consider the qualifications of the person appointed and may issue either a separate or a joint report and recommendation concerning that person; then
        </li>
        <li id="t39c05s39.05.080ol12B">
         the legislature shall, before the end of the regular session in which the appointments are presented, in joint session assembled, act on the appointments by confirming or declining to confirm by a majority vote of all of the members the appointments presented.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t39c05s39.05.080ol13">
       When the legislature declines to confirm an appointment, the legislature shall notify the governor of its action and a vacancy in the position or membership exists which the governor shall fill by making a new appointment. The governor may not appoint again the same person whose confirmation was refused for the same position or membership during the regular session of the legislature at which confirmation was refused. The person whose name is refused for appointment by the legislature may not thereafter be appointed to the same position or membership during the interim between regular legislative sessions. Failure of the legislature to act to confirm or decline to confirm an appointment during the regular session in which the appointment was presented is tantamount to a declination of confirmation on the day the regular session adjourns.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c05s39.05.080ol14">
       Pending confirmation or rejection of appointment by the legislature, persons appointed shall exercise the functions, have the powers, and be charged with the duties prescribed by law for the appointive positions or membership. However, the duration of an appointment made during the time period between regular sessions of the legislature by a person who is not still the governor on the first day of the next regular session ends on the date during the next regular session that the sitting governor presents for confirmation an appointment to the office. For the purpose of applying laws that limit the number of terms or parts of terms that may be served by a member of a board or commission, the part of the term of office that is served under an interim appointment immediately before the member is reappointed under this paragraph is considered to be merged with the part of the term of office that is served immediately after reappointment so that the two periods of service constitute only one part of a term. The duration of an appointment made during a regular session of the legislature and not presented to the legislature by the governor during that session ends no later than the last day of that session. The duration of an appointment made during an interim by a governor who is not in office at the beginning of the next regular session of the legislature ends no later than the last day of that regular session unless the governor who is in office during that session presents the person’s name for confirmation. The same governor may not appoint the same person to the same position or membership if the person’s appointment ends because of the governor’s failure to present the person’s name for confirmation.

     <p>
      An occupational licensing board member cannot receive a per diem allowance for conducting an activity that should be performed by division personnel; any activity approved must be specifically defined by statute as a board duty and should be an activity that cannot be accomplished within the confines of a board meeting. If the task can be performed during a meeting, then per diem should not be paid for time unnecessarily spent by a board member outside a board meeting. It is important, of course, for budgetary reasons, that board activity for which per diem compensation is sought be kept to a minimum. November 6, 1984 Op. Att’y Gen.

       Because of the state’s adoption of federal personnel rules and regulation regarding promotion and separation in the Alaska National Guard, it has “otherwise provided by law” that members of the National Guard are exempt from the Alaska Personnel Act. State, Dep't of Military &amp; Veterans Affairs v. Bowen, 953 P.2d 888 (Alaska 1998).

        Effect of being in exempt service. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The “exempt service” is a category of jobs which, for whatever reason, the Legislature wanted to exclude from the state personnel system.
       Not every person in the exempt service is a confidential employee.
       The fact that plaintiff was in the exempt service did not mean that the Alaska Energy Center lacked the power to give him a three-year contract. Zerbetz v. Alaska Energy Ctr., 708 P.2d 1270 (Alaska 1985).

       This chapter and the applicable regulations adopted thereunder do not entitle an employee in the classified service, who is paid a fixed monthly salary, to receive any compensation for overtime, either in the form of cash or compensatory leave time unless: He is a member of the class eligible to receive overtime payment under personnel rule 7 05.2; he has worked hours in excess of his scheduled hours; and his appointing authority has authorized in writing payment for such overtime work. Even if these conditions are satisfied, personnel rule 9 04 stipulates that the employee is entitled to overtime pay only at his hourly rate. State v. Bogenrife, 513 P.2d 13 (Alaska 1973).

       When a public servant is paid by time, for example by the month, rather than by the quantity of work performed, he is expected to perform his duties without extra compensation for overtime or holiday hours worked.

        “Employee in the classified service,”
       </b>
       as used in this section, has been administratively construed as referring to employees having a permanent, rather than a probationary status, except in cases where dismissal of a probationary employee is due to racial, religious, or political discrimination. Whaley v. State, 438 P.2d 718 (Alaska 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       An employee holding permanent status is considered “An employee in the classified service” under subsection (a). Titus v. State, 451 P.2d 342 (Alaska 1969).

       <b>
        Appeal limited to employees occupying permanent status. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A construction of this section which limits the right to a hearing following dismissal to employees occupying a permanent status with the state government is in harmony with the decisions of other courts which, in considering the status of one as a probationary employee, have held that removal provisions relating to persons who are permanently appointed are not applicable to one in a probationary status, and that the latter may be discharged or dismissed without an opportunity to defend himself or without a hearing of any kind. Whaley v. State, 438 P.2d 718 (Alaska 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Provisional status”. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The administrative construction of the term “provisional status” is that it is an employment status that is temporary and lacking in permanency to the same extent, if not more so, than probationary status. Whaley v. State, 438 P.2d 718 (Alaska 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A provisional employee has no right to an appeal
       </b>
       to and a hearing by the personnel board following dismissal from state employment. Whaley v. State, 438 P.2d 718 (Alaska 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a probationary employee is not an “employee in the classified service,” within the meaning of this section, then neither is a provisional employee one in the classified service entitled under this section to the right to a hearing by the personnel board upon being dismissed from employment, except where dismissal is due to racial, religious, or political discrimination. Whaley v. State, 438 P.2d 718 (Alaska 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The board’s findings should not be reversed
       </b>
       if in light of the whole record they are supported by substantial evidence, i.e., such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Titus v. State, 451 P.2d 342 (Alaska 1969).

       Where an administrative regulation has been adopted in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act, and it appears the legislature intended to commit to the agency discretion as to the particular matter that is the subject of the regulation, the court will review the regulation to ascertain whether it is consistent with and reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of the statutory provisions conferring rule-making authority on the agency. The court will then determine whether the regulation is reasonable and not arbitrary. Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906 (Alaska 1971).

      This section gave the territory the legal authority to enter into an agreement extending the coverage of the federal Social Security Act to employees of the territory. The agreement was entered into on September 26, 1951, and is continued in effect by § 2, art. XV of the state constitution continuing contracts of the territory and making the state legal successor to the territory.
      Since the agreement is in effect, the term “territory” has not been changed to “state” in this section. However, in AS

      , which relate to the continuing coverage of the agreement, the change from “territory” to “state” has been made.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 7, Chapter 58, SLA 1979, provided for an election to decide if the state should withdraw from the federal Social Security System.
      The election was held in September, 1979, and the state employees voted to withdraw.
      Withdrawal from the federal Social Security System was subsequently accomplished. Consequently, the agreement in this section no longer has any application to employees of the state.

    <p>
     In general, a person’s right to benefits under the state’s public employee retirement systems vests when the person joins the system. Hammond v. Hoffbeck, 627 P.2d 1052 (Alaska 1981). Therefore, former law may govern the benefits of some members of the teachers’ retirement system. The user is advised to ascertain which version of a particular statute is applicable. Earlier versions of the statutes can be found in prior editions of the Alaska Statutes or in the published Session Laws of Alaska.
    </p>
    <p>
     This chapter was extensively amended by ch. 82, SLA 1986. Sections 57-58, ch. 82, SLA 1986, as amended by § 34, ch. 106, SLA 1988, provide:
     “Sections 16, 22-23, 25-27, 42, 44, 45, and 50 of this Act apply only to members first hired under the Public Employees’ Retirement System after June 30, 1986. Changes in the Public Employees’ Retirement System enacted in this Act that require a reduction in benefits to members of the retirement system apply only to members who are first hired under the retirement system after June 30, 1986
     . . .. The amendments made by secs. 46 and 49 of this Act apply only to members first hired under the Public Employees’ Retirement System after December 31, 1986
     . . .. Other sections of this Act apply to all members of the Public Employees’ Retirement System, regardless of the date of hire.”

     This fund does not represent an unconstitutional dedication of public funds under § 7, art. IX, of the state constitution, as that section of the constitution contains an implied exception for pension fund contributions.

A waiver under this subsection waives coverage of future employment as an elected official, regardless of any change of employer. An elected official may file a waiver under this subsection at any time after election to office, including the period before taking the oath of office. An elected official may revoke a waiver under this subsection by filing a written revocation with the administrator. A revocation under this subsection operates prospectively only, and the elected official may not receive credited service for service as an elected official while the waiver was in effect. There is no limit on the number of times an elected official may file a waiver or revocation under this subsection.

       Service as an elected official before January 1, 1981, with an employer may be included retroactively as credited service with the plan if the elected official or former elected official makes retroactive contributions equal to what the official would have made if the elected official or former elected official had been included in the plan when the oath of office as an elected official was taken, plus accrued interest from July 1, 1984. The rate used to calculate the retroactive contributions may not be less than the rate in effect on January 1, 1961. An elected official or former elected official may not receive credited service under this subsection for any period in which the elected official or former elected official was receiving a retirement benefit from the plan. An elected official or former elected official receiving a retirement benefit from the plan on January 1, 1981, is not eligible to claim credited service under this subsection unless the elected official or former elected official is reemployed as an active member. Service as an elected official with an employer constitutes employment as an active member as long as a waiver of coverage under (a) of this section is not in effect.

      Contributions of employees shall be made by payroll deductions.

      It is of no consequence that a payroll deduction may cause the compensation paid in cash to an employee to be reduced below the minimum required by law. Payment of an employee’s compensation, less payroll deductions, is a full and complete discharge and satisfaction of all claims and demands by the employee relating to remuneration of services during the period covered by the payment, except with respect to the benefits provided under the plan.

A vested member who claims retroactive credited service on or after July 1, 1988, is indebted to the plan. The amount of the indebtedness is the full actuarial cost of providing benefits for the credited service claimed. Interest as established by regulation accrues on the indebtedness under this subsection beginning the first of the month following establishment of the indebtedness. Any outstanding indebtedness that exists at the time the officer or firefighter retires requires an actuarial adjustment to the benefits that are based on retroactive credited service under this subsection.

     Benefits under Public Employees’ Retirement System are in the nature of deferred compensation and the right to such benefits vests immediately upon an employee’s enrollment in that system. Hammond v. Hoffbeck, 627 P.2d 1052 (Alaska 1981).
    </p>
    <p>
     The vested benefits protected by Alaska Const., art. XII, § 7, necessarily include not only the dollar amount of the benefits payable, but the requirements for eligibility as well. Hammond v. Hoffbeck, 627 P.2d 1052 (Alaska 1981).
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact that rights in Public Employees’ Retirement System vest on employment does not preclude modifications of the system; that fact does, however, require that any changes in the system that operate to a given employee’s disadvantage must be offset by comparable new advantages to that employee. Hammond v. Hoffbeck, 627 P.2d 1052 (Alaska 1981).

      In general, a person’s right to benefits under the state’s public employee retirement systems vests when the person joins the system. Hammond v. Hoffbeck, 627 P.2d 1052 (Alaska 1981). Therefore, former law may govern the benefits of some members of the public employees’ retirement system. The user is advised to ascertain which version of the statute is applicable. Earlier versions of the statutes can be found in prior editions of the Alaska Statutes or in the published Session Laws of Alaska.

To claim the service, the elected public officer must have been an elected public officer of a municipality or political subdivision that was an employer under this plan during the elected service and must have been employed full-time under AS 14.25 during that time. When the elected public officer claims that service, an indebtedness to the plan is established. The amount of the indebtedness is the full actuarial cost of providing benefits for the service claimed. Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues on that indebtedness beginning on July 1, 1989. Any outstanding indebtedness existing at the time the person retires requires an actuarial adjustment to the benefits payable based on that service.

      In general, a person’s right to benefits under the state’s public employee retirement systems vests when the person joins the system. Hammond v. Hoffbeck, 627 P.2d 1052 (Alaska 1981). Therefore, former law may govern the benefits of some members of the public employees’ retirement system. The user is advised to ascertain which version of the statute is applicable. Earlier versions of the statutes can be found in prior editions of the Alaska Statutes or in the published Session Laws of Alaska.

       The 1976 amendment to subsections (d) and (g) of this section has the effect of diminishing the vested rights of public safety employees hired before July 1, 1976, who choose to receive benefits under the system in effect at the time they were hired and insofar as applied to those employees, the amended subsections are violative of Alaska Const., art.

       A former employee who had withdrawn his Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) contributions is not eligible for occupational disability benefits. Only “employees” are eligible for occupational disability benefits under PERS. “Former members” of PERS are not considered “employees.” “Former member” includes any employee who has received a total refund of the balance of the employee contribution account, or who has requested in writing a refund of the balance in the employee contribution account.

       In occupational disability claims, unlike workers’ compensation claims, the employee bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the disability was proximately caused by an injury which occurred in the course of employment.

       Under subsection (a), where an employee’s disability was caused by surgery she underwent prior to employment, the fact that she could not sit for long periods of time as needed for her job did not have to be the determining factor, but only a determining factor, in finding disability. Further, the condition was not required to have been caused by the employment she was forced to leave because of the disability. Shea v. State, 267 P.3d 624 (Alaska 2011).

      </p>
      <p>
       The Public Employees’ Retirement Board applied the correct legal standard in considering whether an occupational injury had been a “substantial factor” in the employee’s disability, and there was substantial evidence to support the Board’s conclusion that the employee’s disability was caused by a degenerative hip condition unrelated to her work. Lopez v. Adm'r, Pub. Emples. Retirement Sys., 20 P.3d 568 (Alaska 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       ALJ's determination that prolonged sitting at work was not the proximate cause of the employee's disability was supported by substantial evidence and denying her occupational disability benefits because a physician's testimony cast doubt on whether the employee suffered from ilioinguinal neuralgia during her employment, breaking the causal chain between her prolonged sitting and the aggravated of a preexisting condition.

       In determining whether an employee was terminated because of his disability, the Public Employee’s Retirement Board and superior court erred by basing their decisions on the employer’s reasons for the termination rather than on the causal relationship between the termination and the employee’s disability.

       Waiver of public employee survivor benefits was an effective contract, and did not deny procedural due process to a surviving spouse. The language of the waiver form, which effectively described the rights relinquished by signing it, was plain and ensured that an erroneous deprivation of benefits was unlikely. The surviving spouse bore the risk of her unilateral mistake; and even if she subjectively intended to waive only some benefits, the contract did not fail for lack of mutual assent. Kingik v.

      In general, a person’s right to benefits under the state’s public employee retirement systems vests when the person joins the system. Hammond v. Hoffbeck, 627 P.2d 1052 (Alaska 1981). Therefore, former law may govern the benefits of some members of the teachers’ retirement system. The user is advised to ascertain which version of a particular statute is applicable. The version of this statute that was in effect immediately after the 1980 amendments read as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Sec. 39.35.475. POST RETIREMENT PENSION ADJUSTMENT. (a) When the administrator determines that the cost of living has increased and that the financial condition of the retirement fund permits, he shall increase benefit payments to persons receiving benefits under this system.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(b) The amount of the increase in benefit payments may not exceed the greater of
     </p>
     <p>
      “(1) the increase in the cost of living since the date of retirement; or
     </p>
     <p>
      “(2) four percent of the retirement benefit compounded for each year of retirement.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(c) If at the time of first receiving a retirement benefit a member was receiving a disability benefit under this system, the administrator shall include the time during which the member received the disability benefit in determining the number of years of retirement under this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(d) An increase in benefit payments under this section is effective July 1 of the year for which the increase is granted.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(e) The administrator shall implement this section by regulation.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The 1982 amendment, effective July 1, 1982, substituted “lesser” for “greater” in the introductory language of subsection (b).
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 49, ch 146, SLA 1980 provides: “The retirement benefit payable to a member of the public employees’ retirement system who is receiving a normal retirement benefit under AS

      , July 1, 1980, and who at the time of his retirement was receiving a disability pension under the public employees’ retirement system, shall be increased by a percentage equal to the percentage of all post-retirement pension adjustments payable under AS

      during the period that the member was receiving a disability benefit.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Under § 112, ch. 9, FSSLA 2005, following amendment by sec. 34, ch. 146, SLA 1980, and until amended by sec. 41, ch. 82, SLA 1986, (a) of this section read: “(a) When the administrator determines that the cost of living has increased and that the financial condition of the retirement fund permits, the administrator shall increase benefit payments to persons receiving benefits under this plan. For purposes of this subsection, the financial condition of the fund would only permit an increase in benefits when the ratio of total fund assets to the accrued liability meets or exceeds 105 percent. In this subsection, “accrued liability” means the present value of all member benefits accrued by member service in this plan.”

      Section 114, ch. 9, FSSLA 2005, amended (c) of this section; sec. 132 of the same Act repealed that subsection.
      The actions had the same effective date.
      The legislative history of Senate Bill 141, the source of the Act, suggests that the proposed amendment of (c) of this section by the House State Affairs Committee was intended to effect change of the Senate-passed bill.
      The Senate-passed bill had proposed to repeal subsection (c), thereby eliminating independent review of recovery of benefits that had been allegedly paid in error.
      The House committee proposed to retain provisions relating to waiver and adjustment of benefits allegedly paid in error. The committee’s version amended subsection (c) to provide a mechanism by which review or oversight would continue notwithstanding the Act’s elimination of the Public Employees’ Retirement Board that had considered them, but failed to eliminate the reference to (c) in the bill section calling for the subsection’s repeal.

      Section 44, ch. 4, FSSLA 1996 provides that nothing in that Act, which amended the definition of “average monthly compensation,” modifies or terminates the terms of a collective bargaining agreement in effect on July 1, 1996.” Under § 45, ch. 4, FSSLA 1996, the provisions of that Act, which amended the definition of “average monthly compensation,” are not severable, notwithstanding AS

      In general, a person’s right to benefits under the state’s public employee retirement systems vests when the person joins the system. Hammond v. Hoffbeck, 627 P.2d 1052 (Alaska 1981). Therefore, former law may govern the benefits of some members of the public employees’ retirement system. The user is advised to ascertain which version of the statute is applicable. Earlier versions of the statutes can be found in prior editions of the Alaska Statutes or in the published Session Laws of Alaska.

       A former employee who had withdrawn his Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) contributions is not eligible for occupational disability benefits. Only “employees” are eligible for occupational disability benefits under PERS. “Former members” of PERS are not considered “employees.” “Former member” includes any employee who has received a total refund of the balance of the employee contribution account, or who has requested in writing a refund of the balance in the employee contribution account. Waller v. Stalnaker, 915 P.2d 637 (Alaska 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a former employee left public employment and took a refund of his retirement contributions, he was statutorily defined as a "former member" of the Public Employees' Retirement System; the benefit the former employee was claiming was one that was promised would be available to him only if he first became a "former member."

      </p>
      <p>
       The Public Employees’ Retirement Board applied the correct legal standard in considering whether an occupational injury had been a “substantial factor” in the employee’s disability, and there was substantial evidence to support the Board’s conclusion that the employee’s disability was caused by a degenerative hip condition unrelated to her work. Lopez v. Adm'r, Pub. Emples. Retirement Sys., 20 P.3d 568 (Alaska 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a claim for occupational disability benefits, the administrative law judge’s finding that prolonged sitting was no more or less of a contributor to her chronic pain condition than anything else the employee was doing during the period of her employment implied that the administrative law judge erroneously thought the employee was required to show sitting was the substantial factor of her disability, and not simply a substantial factor of her disability. Shea v. State, 267 P.3d 624 (Alaska 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       ALJ's determination that prolonged sitting at work was not the proximate cause of the employee's disability was supported by substantial evidence and denying her occupational disability benefits because a physician's testimony cast doubt on whether the employee suffered from ilioinguinal neuralgia during her employment, breaking the causal chain between her prolonged sitting and the aggravated of a preexisting condition.

       An employee who is seeking occupational or nonoccupational disability benefits must prove that her condition is more likely than not permanent and, if she meets that burden, her condition is presumably permanent and she is entitled to disability benefits. Stalnaker v. Williams, 960 P.2d 590 (Alaska 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining an employees’ entitlement to occupational disability benefits, the Public Employees’ Retirement Board erred by looking for evidence of a permanent, rather than presumably permanent, disability. Stalnaker v. Williams, 960 P.2d 590 (Alaska 1998).

       Employee’s application for disability benefits from the Alaska Public Employees Retirement System was properly denied because the employee’s mental condition did not amount to an occupational or nonoccupational disability; out of nine physicians and psychologists, only one concluded that the employee could not work because of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

       Under the definition of “occupational disability” in this section, a state employee was eligible for benefits if he could not perform his old job or a comparable job made available by a Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) employer, but found a well-paying job outside PERS; the “75% rule”, by which a comparable position was determined as one which provided a compensation of 75% or more of the salary used to calculate the member’s PERS occupational disability benefit, which appeared in the version of a regulation (2 AAC 35.291(a)) in effect at the time of employee’s termination, was contrary to the statutory definition of “employer”.

       Court had authority to approve a post-dissolution qualified domestic relations order where parties agreed when they dissolved their marriage eight years earlier, to divide husband’s retirement benefits, and wife should have been awarded survivor benefits, as an integral part of what the parties agreed to divide. Zito v. Zito, 969 P.2d 1144 (Alaska 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an original marriage dissolution order includes an agreement to divide the marital interest in retirement benefits, issuance of a post-dissolution qualified domestic relations order neither adds to nor modifies the original judgment; a QDRO simply enforces a court order calling for division of retirement benefits.

      “Employee retirement system”. —

    <p>
     The Elected Public Officers Retirement System is an “employee retirement system” within the meaning of Alaska Const., art. XII, § 7, which provides that membership in state employee retirement systems shall constitute a contractual relationship. State ex rel. Hammond v. Allen, 625 P.2d 844 (Alaska 1981).
    </p>
    <p>
     There is no valid basis upon which to distinguish the rights of elected officials in the Elected Public Officers Retirement System from their rights in the public employees’ retirement system in the context of Alaska Const., art. XII, § 7. State ex rel. Hammond v. Allen, 625 P.2d 844 (Alaska 1981).

      Contractual relationship. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The Elected Public Officers Retirement System constitutes a contractual relationship between participants in that program and the state of Alaska, which must be honored by the state. Therefore, all elected officials who were participating in the Elected Public Officers Retirement System at the time its repeal became effective [October 14, 1976] will be entitled to the benefits provided by that system upon retirement. State ex rel. Hammond v. Allen, 625 P.2d 844 (Alaska 1981).

     Walters v. Cease, 388 P.2d 263 (Alaska 1964), which held that the effectiveness of an act passed by the legislature is not suspended during the period between its effective date and its rejection by referendum, clearly establishes that the legislation enacting this chapter, ch. 205, SLA 1975, whatever its import, was in full force from January 1, 1976, its effective date, until October 14, 1976, the date of repeal by referendum.

      Rights not subject to implied condition subsequent of repeal. —

    </p>
    <p>
     Even though a referendum petition was duly filed over three months before the effective date of this chapter (Jan. 1, 1976), the rights accrued under the Elected Public Officers Retirement System were not subject to any implied condition subsequent of repeal by the electorate, and those rights remain fully enforceable. State ex rel. Hammond v. Allen, 625 P.2d 844 (Alaska 1981).

     . . . liability incurred or right accruing or accrued under such law” and finding a condition subsequent to be implicit in the contract under consideration would undermine Alaska Const., art. XII, § 7. State ex rel. Hammond v. Allen, 625 P.2d 844 (Alaska 1981).

        Primary jurisdiction —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case where voters brought actions for alleged numerous acts and omissions by elected borough officials, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction did not require a superior court to stay the claims pending resolution by the Alaska Public Offices Commission (APOC); the applicable factors might have counseled against the application of the doctrine to the voters' claims. Courts were available to hear conflict of interest claims, there was a minimal risk of inconsistent resolutions, and judicial resolution of the allegations was unlikely to encroach on APOC's regulatory responsibilities.

        Exhaustion of administrative remedies not required —

      </p>
      <p>
       Both the plain language and legislative history of the citizen suit provision and the administrative complaint provision show that exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required; therefore, it was error for a trial court to determine that a group of registered voters had to exhaust their administrative remedies prior to bringing actions for alleged numerous acts and omissions by elected borough officials.

        Exhaustion of administrative remedies not required —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the plain language and legislative history of the citizen suit provision and the administrative complaint provision show that exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required; therefore, it was error for a trial court to determine that a group of registered voters had to exhaust their administrative remedies prior to bringing actions for alleged numerous acts and omissions by elected borough officials.

       A written report to a state employer is a report to a “public body” within the meaning of the Alaska Whistleblower Act and, thus, an employee is protected for such reporting. Alaska Hous. Fin. Corp. v. Salvucci, 950 P.2d 1116 (Alaska 1997).

       In a termination of employment case, the seafood inspector's whistleblower claim was properly dismissed because the protected activity that the inspector alleged as a necessary element of the whistleblower claim was the same activity that he alleged as a necessary element of his First Amendment claim, which was his report of the agency director's alleged ethics violation, but the jury rejected his First Amendment claim as it found that the inspector's filing of an ethics complaint against the agency director was not a substantial or motivating factor for the State of Alaska's termination of his employment; thus, the factual basis for his whistleblower claim was made moot by the jury's earlier rejection of his First Amendment claim.

       Claim that the State had fired a Department of Transportation and Public Facilities employee for sending letters critical of his supervisors to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor was without merit, where the letters primarily addressed personal conflicts and did not discuss issues of public concern, thus not implicating First Amendment protections.
