      The division of lands is the proper agency for acceptance of title.
      The division of aviation in the (former) Department of Public Works (now the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities) possesses the authority to manage the granted land for airport and directly related purposes while the division of lands possesses the authority to manage the granted land for other public purposes.

      Those materials and supplies so purchased by the department may be delivered to the project site without expense to the contractor, or it may sell them to the contractor at cost and make the materials and supplies a part of the construction cost.

        Principles in awarding of contracts. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Three important principles involved in the awarding of public contracts are (1) that the lowest bid price is preferred; (2) that rules of construction which are expressed in specifications should be followed in order to resolve discrepancies; and (3) that the intent of the bidder when it is evidenced from the face of the bid is significant.

        Departmental discretion not abused. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities did not abuse its discretion by determining that a construction company’s bid could not be withdrawn because of its mistake where the mistake made was a small one compared to the size of the project and within the expectable variation of the contractor’s costs, the mistake would not cause the bidder to lose money, and the mistaken bid differed only slightly from one that was not mistaken; and the department did not abuse its discretion by applying its regulation favoring words over numerals. Alaska Int'l Constr. v. Earth Movers, 697 P.2d 626 (Alaska 1985).

       <b>
        Rule of construction not applied. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The lowest bid price and the apparent intent of the bidder to mean a lower numerically expressed unit price rather than the written price were the determinative factor in the awarding of a contract where a unit price as written was ten times the unit price as expressed in numbers.
       The words over numbers rule of construction was not applied. Jensen &amp; Reynolds Constr. Co. v. State, DOT &amp; Pub. Facilities, 717 P.2d 844 (Alaska 1986).

      The division of lands is the proper agency for acceptance of title.
      The division of aviation in the (former) Department of Public Works (now the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities) possesses the authority to manage the granted land for airport and directly related purposes while the division of lands possesses the authority to manage the land for other public purposes.

     <p>
      A declaration of taking, in the form of an order signed by the commissioner, declaring that the real property, or an interest in it, or any easement is necessary for the public use of the state is sufficient to vest title in the state. However, a declaration of taking is not effective until eminent domain proceedings have been instituted in the proper court and a copy of the declaration of taking is recorded in the office of the recorder located in the recording district where the land is located. The department may pay or have paid, from the appropriate fund, into court the amount it considers represents a reasonable valuation for the land, easement, or materials taken.

      There is no irreconcilable conflict between this section and AS 02.25 et seq. (regarding airport zoning) because they can be harmonized. This section may be read as requiring all state departments to comply with local planning and zoning ordinances in the same manner and to the same extent as other landowners with the exception of planning and zoning for state-owned airports. However, if the conflict is considered irreconcilable, then the special statute (AS 02.25 et seq.) prevails over the more general (this section). October 24, 1996 Op. Att’y Gen.
