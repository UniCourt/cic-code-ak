    The provisions of this title were redrafted in 1986 to remove personal pronouns pursuant to § 4, ch. 58, SLA 1982 and in 1986, 1994, 2006, and 2014 to make other, minor word changes. In 1980, the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code formerly set out in AS 45.05, were renumbered as AS 45.01 — AS 45.09 so that the numbering now corresponds to the numbering of the official text of the Uniform Commercial Code. To determine the disposition of sections formerly numbered within AS 45.05, or to determine the prior numbering of sections now numbered within AS 45.01 — AS 45.09, see the Table of Sections Amended, Etc., in Volume 11.

      <p>
       Where both the code and general principles are available, the former should always be considered and applied if applicable. By legislative declaration, the code is the law, and if general principles appear inconsistent, they must be considered displaced under this section.
       Moreover, even where inconsistency does not exist, the code must be regarded as supreme; general principles, even when consistent with the code, are merely supplementary. Prince v. Le Van, 486 P.2d 959 (Alaska 1971).

      <p>
       The code does not cover every aspect of contract law and where a situation arises that calls for application of legal or equitable principles not displaced by code provisions, courts are free to use these supplemental principles. Kelly v. Miller, 575 P.2d 1221 (Alaska 1978).

        But such principles do not displace code. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section the principles of equity, including mistake, misrepresentation, and other invalidating grounds “supplement” the code provisions and apply “unless displaced by the particular provision of this chapter.”
       It appears then, that general principles of contract law remain in effect to some extent under the code.
       Nevertheless, even when general principles remain operative, they merely supplement the code; they do not displace it so as to exclude application of its specific provisions where relevant. Prince v. Le Van, 486 P.2d 959 (Alaska 1971).

      <p>
       <b>
        A determination of whether a depositary has acted in good faith
       </b>
       involves a subjective inquiry as to whether the bank extended credit on a check having knowledge of facts suggesting that the check would eventually be dishonored. Frantz v. First Nat'l Bank, 584 P.2d 1125 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Draftsmen of the Uniform Commercial Code expressly rejected the idea of including a concept of objective commercial reasonableness within the meaning of good faith. Frantz v. First Nat'l Bank, 584 P.2d 1125 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Mere knowledge of a pre-existing unperfected security interest
       </b>
       by a subsequent security interest holder cannot itself be bad faith, for that would defeat the operation of the “pure race” recording system of the U.C.C. Division of Agric. v. Fowler, 611 P.2d 58 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Extension of immediate credit on check. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent subjective knowledge that the payor would not honor the check he wrote, the extension of immediate credit on a check does not manifest bad faith. Frantz v. First Nat'l Bank, 584 P.2d 1125 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Tests to determine notice of a defense. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Subjective and objective tests are used to determine whether a depositary had notice of a defense to a check, i.e., whether it knew or should have known of a defense against a particular instrument at the time it was negotiated for value. Frantz v. First Nat'l Bank, 584 P.2d 1125 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       A bank’s awareness of a depositor’s overdrafts or rumored plans to depart is not probative, because knowledge of a depositor’s financial problems does not impart notice of a defense to a check issued to him by a third party. Frantz v. First Nat'l Bank, 584 P.2d 1125 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        No affirmative duty to inquire. —

      <p>
       Absent actual knowledge or reason to know, a bank has no affirmative duty to inquire whether a defense exists. Frantz v. First Nat'l Bank, 584 P.2d 1125 (Alaska 1978).

        “Security interest.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A motor vehicle dealer’s interest under a retail installment contract was a “security interest.” Decker v. Aurora Motors, 409 P.2d 603 (Alaska 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Liquor license could qualify as a security interest under Alaska’s codification of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Queen of the N., Inc. v. LeGrue, 582 P.2d 144 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Surety’s right to earned progress payments
       </b>
       does not qualify as an interest in personal property subject to the filing provisions of the code since the surety has the right to complete the job it has bonded and apply any earned funds against its costs.
       This does not secure the payment or performance of an obligation as a “security interest” as that term is defined in this section. Alaska State Bank v. General Ins. Co., 579 P.2d 1362 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Whether lease intended as security determined by facts of case. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the definition of “security interest” in this section, it is clear that the question whether a lease is intended as security is to be determined by the facts of each case. McGalliard v. Liberty Leasing Co., 534 P.2d 528 (Alaska 1975), overruled, Western Enters., Inc. v. Arctic Office Machs., Inc., 667 P.2d 1232 (Alaska 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Nominality of option price. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of “security interest” makes the nominality of the option price only one of the indicia of whether the transaction is a lease or a purchase agreement. Western Enters., Inc. v. Arctic Office Machs., Inc., 667 P.2d 1232 (Alaska 1983) (decided prior to the 1993 amendment of the definition of “security interest”).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that an option price is not nominal does not foreclose construing a purported lease as a purchase agreement. Western Enters., Inc. v. Arctic Office Machs., Inc., 667 P.2d 1232 (Alaska 1983) (decided prior to the 1993 amendment of the definition of “security interest”).

       Notice, knowledge, or a notice or notification received by an organization is effective for a particular transaction from the time it is brought to the attention of the individual conducting that transaction and, in any event, from the time it would have been brought to the individual’s attention if the organization had exercised due diligence. An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual’s regular duties or the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.

      <p>
       <b>
        This section permits the introduction of parol evidence
       </b>
       in sale transactions to explain or supplement the writing through evidence of consistent additional terms, unless the court finds the writing was intended as a complete and exclusive expression of the terms of the contract. Braund, Inc. v. White, 486 P.2d 50 (Alaska 1971), overruled in part, Christensen v. Alaska Sales &amp; Serv., 335 P.3d 514 (Alaska 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to exclude parol evidence testimony concerning the inclusion of consistent additional terms in sale agreements, the trial court must make the specific finding either that the agreement was intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the contract, or that, as a matter of law, the additional terms asserted were such that, if they had been agreed upon, they certainly would have been included in the documents of sale. Braund, Inc. v. White, 486 P.2d 50 (Alaska 1971), overruled in part, Christensen v. Alaska Sales &amp; Serv., 335 P.3d 514 (Alaska 2014).

       Even though the trial court determines that, under the Uniform Commercial Code no parol evidence can be introduced, the code does not preclude the common-law remedy of reformation for mutual mistake, to which the parol evidence rule is not applicable. Braund, Inc. v. White, 486 P.2d 50 (Alaska 1971), overruled in part, Christensen v. Alaska Sales &amp; Serv., 335 P.3d 514 (Alaska 2014).

       Collateral agreements (1) that a lease and option to purchase were with one company rather than another and were intended to be re-executed on proper forms, and (2) that earlier payments under a former lease would be credited toward the purchase price both appeared to vary or alter the written terms of the agreement rather than to prove consistent additional terms, and therefore, ordinarily, parol evidence could not be used for the purpose of establishing their existence.

       Conduct by both parties that recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract.  In this case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with supplementary terms incorporated under other provisions of the code.

       A party may perform the party’s duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having the original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of a duty to perform or a liability for breach.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c02a02s45.02.210ol1b">
       Unless otherwise agreed, all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, increase materially the burden or risk imposed on the other party by the contract, or impair materially the chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor’s due performance of the entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.

      <li id="t45c02a02s45.02.210ol1c">
       The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the seller’s interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer’s chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of (b) of this section unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller; even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection, and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but

       An assignment of “the contract” or “all my rights under the contract” or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and, unless the language or the circumstances, as in an assignment for security, indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by the assignee to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.

       Hence, in Alaska there is no right to a common-law action for breaches of these warranties. Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., 430 F. Supp. 134 (D. Alaska 1977).

       (a) a warranty of merchantability is implied only “if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.”
       A second implied warranty may arise under this section.
       It includes as an element a warranty of fitness for a particular purpose as distinguished from ordinary purposes under the warranty of merchantability.
       It is not, by its terms, restricted only to merchants.
       It applies to a seller, whether or not he is a merchant, who at the time of contracting has reason to know a particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller’s skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods.

Smith v. Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co., 524 F.2d 776 (9th Cir. Alaska 1975)(decided prior to Morrow v. New Moon Homes, 548 P.2d 279 (Alaska 1976).

       A manufacturer can be held liable for direct economic loss attributable to a breach of implied warranties without regard to privity of contract between the manufacturer and the ultimate purchaser. Morrow v. New Moon Homes, 548 P.2d 279 (Alaska 1976).

       Abolition of privity is extended to embrace not only warranty actions for personal injuries and property damage but also those for economic loss. Morrow v. New Moon Homes, 548 P.2d 279 (Alaska 1976).

       Because the typical consumer is unable to protect himself adequately from defectively manufactured goods, the manufacturer impliedly assures when putting goods on the market that they are safe, and the manufacturer has the superior ability to bear the risk, a manufacturer may be hld liable for a breach of implied warranties without regard to privity of contract between the manufacturer and the customer.

       A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer so announces by the fall of the hammer or in other customary manner.

       Financing on a mobile home purchased by an unmarried couple was subsequently paid off under circumstances where the man improperly took title for himself alone after having promised to give the home to the woman, who resided in the home. The man subsequently sold the home to a third party without disclosing the status of the home’s residents, or the couple’s prior agreement. The evidence at trial was inadequate to grant the third party bona fide purchaser status, both because the nature of the title held by the seller (void or voidable), and the possible good faith of the third party, were in question.

      <p>
       Where the parties entered into a contract for the sale of a tractor and the buyer had unconditional possession of it, the seller was limited to contractual remedies for breach of contract. This section provided the seller the means by which he could have recovered damages from the buyer for breach of the contract.
       In repossessing the tractor without judicial process, and disposing of it as he saw fit, the seller fashioned his own remedy and in so doing, forewent whatever damage claim he may have had against the buyer. Therefore, the seller’s failure to seek the remedy provided him under subsection (a)(1) of this section combined with his resort to a remedy not recognized at either law or equity, precluded him from recovering damages for any loss he may have suffered as a result of the breach of contract. Kelly v. Miller, 575 P.2d 1221 (Alaska 1978).

       Buyer’s failure to pay the down payment on a tractor on the date of the sale agreement or the remaining purchase price within a reasonable time was a breach of contract.

Following judgment he could have executed on the property to satisfy his judgment. Instead, the seller simply reclaimed the tractor without benefit of judicial process and disposed of it as he saw fit, and was precluded from recovering for his remaining loss. Kelly v.

       This section applies when a buyer rightfully rejects or revokes acceptance of nonconforming goods; under subsection (a) of this section “cancellation” of the contract and restitution of “so much of the price as has been paid” is available.
       This remedy is, in effect, one form of rescission, and a notice of rescission may be given effect as a revocation of acceptance and a cancellation, thus giving effect to the intent of the buyer to terminate the contract within the terminology of the code.

        Limiting consequential damages. —

      <p>
       Because the company acted in bad faith when it breached the warranty, the company could not conscionably enforce the warranty provision barring consequential damages. Pierce v. Catalina Yachts, Inc., 2 P.3d 618 (Alaska 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a limited repair remedy fails, and a separate provision of the warranty bars consequential damages, the code fails to say whether a court should apply subsection (b) by restoring the buyer’s right to seek consequential damages, or whether it should instead apply subsection (c) by enforcing the bar against consequential damages unless unconscionable. However, the court found that subsections (b) and (c) should be interpreted independently, thus allowing parties latitude to contract around consequential damages while protecting buyers from unconscionable results.

       Where an action is correctly brought within the framework of the Uniform Commercial Code, the applicable statute of limitations is that provided by the code, although the damages sought are for personal injuries. Sinka v. Northern Commercial Co., 491 P.2d 116 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the repealer section provided by the Alaska legislature in enacting the Uniform Commercial Code (SLA 1962, ch. 114, § 10.103) provides in part that “. . . all acts and parts of acts inconsistent with this Act are hereby repealed,” the general two-year statute of limitations (AS

       In a breach of warranty action, unless the warranty at issue “explicitly extends to future performance” — which an implied warranty does not — the four-year statute of limitations provided in this section begins to run on the date the product is purchased. Armour v. Alaska Power Auth., 765 P.2d 1372 (Alaska 1988).

      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, a party is not entitled to maintain an action for breach of warranty simply by bringing suit within four years of the termination of the warranty period; when a warranty extends to future performance, the cause of action accrues on the day the defect is or should have been discovered, provided this day is within the warranty period.

        But those in privity allowed longer limitation. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are valid reasons for allowing a longer limitation period to plaintiffs who have contracted with the defendant or who otherwise satisfy the privity requirement than to those who have not. Anderson v. Fairchild Hiller Corp., 358 F. Supp. 976 (D. Alaska 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a product is defective and causes injuries, the seller wants to know about it as soon as possible to take appropriate steps to prevent further injuries and further liability. For example, the seller may recall the products that have already been sold, correct those which have been manufactured but not yet sold, and change the manufacturing process to eliminate the defect in the future.
       Thus, a longer limitation period is allowed to persons whose identity a seller knows or is able to discover through the privity limitation, whereas the shorter period is required of persons whose identity a seller has no way of knowing until a lawsuit is filed. Anderson v. Fairchild Hiller Corp., 358 F. Supp. 976 (D. Alaska 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a seller has not had an opportunity to bargain for a shorter limitation period with persons who lack privity of contract, it would be inappropriate to give such persons the benefit of the same longer statute of limitations governing those persons who have bargained and contracted with the seller. Anderson v. Fairchild Hiller Corp., 358 F. Supp. 976 (D. Alaska 1973).

       The law applicable to conversion of personal property applies to instruments. An instrument is also converted if it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation, from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument, or a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment. An action for conversion of an instrument may not be brought by the issuer or acceptor of the instrument, or by a payee or endorsee who did not receive delivery of the instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a co-payee.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c03a04s45.03.420ol1b">
       In an action under (a) of this section, the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument, but recovery may not exceed the amount of the plaintiff’s interest in the instrument.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c03a04s45.03.420ol1c">
       A representative, other than a depositary bank, who has in good faith dealt with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of one who was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument is not liable in conversion to that person beyond the amount of any proceeds that it has not paid out.

       The effect of this chapter may be varied by agreement, but the parties to the agreement may not disclaim a bank’s responsibility for its lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care or limit the measure of damages for the lack or failure. However, the parties may determine by agreement the standards by which the bank’s responsibility is to be measured if the standards are not manifestly unreasonable.

      <li id="t45c04a01s45.04.103ol1b">
       Federal Reserve regulations and operating circulars, clearinghouse rules, and the like have the effect of agreements under (a) of this section, whether or not specifically assented to by all parties interested in items handled.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c04a01s45.04.103ol1c">
       Action or nonaction approved by this chapter or under Federal Reserve regulations or operating circulars is the exercise of ordinary care and, in the absence of special instructions, action or nonaction consistent with clearinghouse rules and the like or with a general banking usage not disapproved by this chapter is prima facie the exercise of ordinary care.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c04a01s45.04.103ol1d">
       The specification or approval of certain procedures by this chapter is not disapproval of other procedures that may be reasonable under the circumstances.

      <li id="t45c04a01s45.04.103ol1e">
       The measure of damages for failure to exercise ordinary care in handling an item is the amount of the item reduced by an amount that could not have been realized by the exercise of ordinary care, and if there is also bad faith it includes any other damages the party suffered as a proximate consequence.

       While the Uniform Commercial Code does not require a depositary to give immediate credit on a check, it encourages this practice by granting the bank rights against the drawer of the check on which immediate credit is extended.

      <p>
       Award of punitive damages was justified where there was ample evidentiary support for finding that following the taking of possession of a retail store the bank willfully and with reckless disregard of the consequences of its actions refused payment on outstanding store checks presented for payment, returned the checks to the store’s suppliers and vendors, and marked the checks “account closed”; at this time the account was not closed, the bank was aware the account was not closed, and these actions were not the result of mistake or inadvertence, but rather were designed to further the bank’s interest.

     Section 115(b), ch. 44, SLA 2009 provides that ch. 44, SLA 2009, “does not apply to a right of action that has accrued before January 1, 2010.”
     Section 116, ch. 44, SLA 2009, provides that “document of title issued or a bailment that arises before January 1, 2010, and the rights, obligations, and interests flowing from that document or bailment are governed by a statute amended or repealed by [ch. 44, SLA 2009] as if the amendment or repeal had not occurred and may be terminated, completed, consummated, or enforced under that statute.”

       A warehouse has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds of the goods in the warehouse’s possession for charges for storage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, insurance, labor, or other charges, present or future, in relation to the goods, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods or reasonably incurred in their sale under law. If the person on whose account the goods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in relation to other goods whenever deposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimed for charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouse also has a lien against the goods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds of the goods in its possession for these charges and expenses, whether or not the other goods have been delivered by the warehouse. However, as against a person to whom a negotiable warehouse receipt is duly negotiated, a warehouse’s lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified in the warehouse receipt or, if no charges are specified, then to a reasonable charge for storage of the specific goods covered by the receipt after the date of the receipt.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c07a02s45.07.209ol1b">
       A warehouse may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for the maximum amount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in (a) of this section, such as for money advanced and interest. The security interest is governed by AS 45.29.

This notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the warehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. The warehouse sells in a commercially reasonable manner if the warehouse sells the goods in the usual manner in a recognized market for the goods, sells at the price current in the market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.

      The 2009 amendment, effective January 1, 2010, rewrote (a), which read, “A carrier’s lien may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in block or in parcels, at any time or place, and on any terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. This notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of a public sale.
      The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the carrier is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. If the carrier either sells the goods in the usual manner in a recognized market for them or if the carrier sells at the price current in the market at the time of the sale or if the carrier has otherwise sold in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold, the carrier has sold in a commercially reasonable manner.
      A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.”; in (b), substituted “in complying with” for “under” following “reasonable expenses incurred”, substituted “the goods may” for “the goods must”, added “of lading” following “subject to the terms of the bill”; in (d), substituted “the carrier’s noncompliance with this section” for “noncompliance by the carrier with the requirements of this section”; rewrote (e), which read, “The carrier may satisfy the lien from the proceeds of a sale under this section, but must hold the balance for delivery on demand to a person to whom the carrier would have been bound to deliver the goods.”; made stylistic changes throughout the section.

       If the amount of interest is not determined by an agreement or rule as stated in (a) of this section, the amount is calculated by multiplying the applicable federal funds rate by the amount on which interest is payable, and then multiplying the product by the number of days for which interest is payable. The applicable federal funds rate is the average of the federal funds rates published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for each of the days for which interest is payable divided by 360. The federal funds rate for a day on which a published rate is not available is the same as the published rate for the next preceding day for which there is a published rate. If a receiving bank that accepted a payment order is required to refund payment to the sender of the order because the funds transfer was not completed, but the failure to complete was not due to any fault by the bank, the interest payable is reduced by a percentage equal to the reserve requirement on deposits of the receiving bank.

     Section 115(a), ch. 44, SLA 2009, provides that the amendments made by ch. 44, SLA 2009, apply “to a document of title that is issued or a bailment that arises on or after January 1, 2010” and do “not apply to a document of title that is issued or a bailment that arises before January 1, 2010, even if the document of title or bailment would be subject to [ch. 44, SLA 2009] if the document of title was issued or the bailment arose on or after January 1, 2010.”
     Section 115(b), ch. 44, SLA 2009 provides that ch. 44, SLA 2009, “does not apply to a right of action that has accrued before January 1, 2010.”
     Section 116, ch. 44, SLA 2009, provides that “A document of title issued or a bailment that arises before January 1, 2010, and the rights, obligations, and interests flowing from that document or bailment are governed by a statute amended or repealed by [ch. 44, SLA 2009] as if the amendment or repeal had not occurred and may be terminated, completed, consummated, or enforced under that statute.”

      <p>
       When a secured party retains collateral that depreciates in value, such as a motor vehicle, for an unduly long period of time and uses the vehicle as his own, the debtor may validly claim that his obligation has been satisfied.
       To rule otherwise would permit overreaching and inequitable abuses by some secured parties. Moran v. Holman, 514 P.2d 817 (Alaska 1973) (decided under former AS 45.09.207).

        Effect of clause giving right to proceeds. —

      <p>
       The right to proceeds under specific mention thereof in a security agreement or financing statement does not in itself constitute an authorization of sale.
       Such a provision exists merely as a precautionary measure so that should a sale occur, the creditor is expressly protected by the terms of the agreement. Northern Commer. Co. v. Cobb, 778 P.2d 205 (Alaska 1989).

        Effect of absence of clause restricting sale. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere absence of a restriction on sale in the security agreement does not constitute implied authorization to sell. Alaska law places no burden on a secured party to restrict resale in the security agreement.
       The question of implied authorization is more properly viewed as a question of fact, with absence of a restriction considered only a factor in that determination. Northern Commer. Co. v. Cobb, 778 P.2d 205 (Alaska 1989).

      <p>
       The term “debtor” as it is used in former AS 45.09.312, means the person who owes payment or other performance of the obligation secured. Brodie Hotel Supply, Inc. v. United States, 431 F.2d 1316 (9th Cir. Alaska 1970) (decided under former AS 45.09.312).
      </p>
      <p>
       In former AS 45.09.312(d), the term “debtor” is given the meaning ascribed to it in former AS 45.09.105(a)(4) (formerly AS 45.05.698(a)(4)).
       Brodie Hotel Supply, Inc. v. United States, 431 F.2d 1316 (9th Cir. Alaska 1970) (decided under former AS 45.09.312).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Holders of purchase-money security interest in noninventory collateral.
       </b>
       The holder of such an interest need not follow the notice procedures prescribed for the holders of purchase-money interests in inventory.
       Such a holder is also given a special priority position.
       His interest, perfected second but within the ten-day grace period, will prevail over any previously perfected security interest.
       This priority exists even though the framers of the code knew that the holder of the conflicting security interest would be relying on the possession of the collateral and upon the absence of a prior filing. Brodie Hotel Supply, Inc. v. United States, 431 F.2d 1316 (9th Cir. Alaska 1970) (decided under former AS 45.09.312).
      </p>
      <p>
       The holder of a purchase-money security interest in noninventory collateral will have priority over a previously perfected security interest which includes the collateral by virtue of an after-acquired property clause.
       Such a holder therefore is not required to search the files to determine the existence of such a conflicting interest in order to be sure of his priority. Brodie Hotel Supply, Inc. v. United States, 431 F.2d 1316 (9th Cir. Alaska 1970) (decided under former AS 45.09.312).
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to file a financing statement before the security interest attached, under (former) AS 45.09.402, did not deprive the holder of a purchase-money interest in noninventory collateral of the favored status given by this section, where the other secured creditor could have protected itself by inquiring into the debtor’s interest in the collateral before accepting his chattel mortgage. Brodie Hotel Supply, Inc. v. United States, 431 F.2d 1316 (9th Cir. Alaska 1970) (decided under former AS 45.09.312).

       In a personal injury suit filed by a passenger against the lienholder of an underinsured vehicle, the lienholder successfully argued that its involvement with the car as lender and lienholder was not a sufficient basis by law to establish liability. Summary judgment for the lienholder was proper because there was no written agreement that the lienholder would provide liability insurance, nor was there any insurance policy from which third-party rights could be extrapolated.

        Debtor’s name erroneously listed in financing statement. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       When the name of the debtor has been erroneously listed on the financing statement, the dispositive question is usually whether or not a reasonable search under the debtor’s true name would uncover the filing; if so, it is assumed that the searcher is on notice to inquire further to discover the correct identity of the debtor. Under some circumstances, however, the financing statement and underlying documents may not provide sufficient notice. Dietrich-Post Co. v. Alaska Nat'l Bank, 638 F.2d 117 (9th Cir. Alaska 1981) (decided under former AS 45.09.402).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the standard of former AS 45.09.402(e), the courts have utilized a flexible, ad hoc approach to determine, by an essentially factual inquiry, the extent to which an error in the financing statement would be misleading to one undertaking a reasonable search. Dietrich-Post Co. v. Alaska Nat'l Bank, 638 F.2d 117 (9th Cir. Alaska 1981) (decided under former AS 45.09.402).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a financing statement and its underlying loan documents mistakenly identified a debtor as the predecessor partnership rather than the corporation, the financing statement was seriously misleading and the lender had no perfected security interest in the assets of the corporation. Dietrich-Post Co. v. Alaska Nat'l Bank, 638 F.2d 117 (9th Cir. Alaska 1981) (decided under former AS 45.09.402).

       Former AS 45.09.503 was enacted to bring the law of Alaska in conformance with the general law on chattel mortgages. Hollembaek v. Alaska Rural Rehabilitation Corp., 447 P.2d 67 (Alaska 1968) (decided under former AS 45.09.503).

        Former AS 45.09.503 did not require any notice to be given.

      <p>
       Notice is not required before a secured party is entitled, after a default, to seize collateral. Kupka v. Morey, 541 P.2d 740 (Alaska 1975) (decided under former AS 45.09.503).

        Repossession held wrongful because of lack of default. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where lack of notice of repossession pertained to placing defendant on notice that he would have responsibility for taking care of the insurance on an aircraft leased by him, in the absence of such notice, under the circumstances here involved, defendant could not be held responsible for maintaining the insurance, and thus there was no breach of the lease terms.
       The repossession was wrongful, not because of the lack of notice of the repossession per se, but because there was no default justifying repossession. Kupka v. Morey, 541 P.2d 740 (Alaska 1975) (decided under former AS 45.09.503).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Failure to give notice held harmless. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a debtor LLC did not seek return of airplanes that were collateral under a security agreement and because an affiliated LLC and an individual who was connected to both of the LLCs did not appeal the superior court's decision that they failed to prove any of their claims against a creditor LLC (or their putative claims against the manager of the LLC), the failure to give any notice before action on the alleged default was harmless.

      <p>
       Superior court's judgment against debtors as well as its order transferring title to an airplane that was collateral under a security agreement were vacated because, with no factual determinations to review, the appellate court was unable to evaluate whether the disputed actions of a creditor in removing the engine and avionics from the airplane were done in breach of the peace.

        Sale price of collateral determines whether obligation extinguished. —

      </p>
      <p>
       It is the amount for which the collateral may be sold at a subsequent execution sale that determines whether the obligation is extinguished. First Nat'l Bank v. Enzler, 537 P.2d 517 (Alaska 1975) (decided under former AS 45.09.504).

        Effect of contingency of debt before sale of collateral. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the liability for a debt in the interim period before the collateral is sold at an execution sale is contingent in that it will only arise should the collateral sell for less than the amount owing, this fact does not preclude the present existence of a debt owed by the contingently liable party to the secured creditor. First Nat'l Bank v. Enzler, 537 P.2d 517 (Alaska 1975) (decided under former AS 45.09.504).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Where collateral is sold in a sale that does not comply with former AS 45.09.504,
       </b>
       there exists a rebuttable presumption that the fair and reasonable value of the collateral is at least equal to the amount of the outstanding debt. Queen of the N., Inc. v. LeGrue, 582 P.2d 144 (Alaska 1978) (decided under former AS 45.09.504).

        Factors in determining value of collateral. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The local economic market at the time of sale is a recognized factor in determining the value of the collateral. Hoch v. Ellis, 627 P.2d 1060 (Alaska 1981) (decided under former AS 45.09.504).

        Fair market value of automobiles. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The wholesale market was the proper measure of the fair market value of automobiles where the creditor, a bank, did not have the facilities to store or sell the vehicles and was not in the business of dealing, selling, or renting cars. Dischner v. United Bank Alaska, 725 P.2d 488 (Alaska 1986) (decided under former AS 45.09.504).

      <p>
       <b>
        Where the creditor was the only bidder at the foreclosure sale
       </b>
       and “sold” the property to itself, which amount was credited against the balance due on the note that had been executed by the debtor, this price at which the creditor bought the collateral that secured the debt was not a reliable indicator of the fair market value of the collateral because the transaction was self-serving. Kobuk Eng'g &amp; Contracting Servs. v. Superior Tank &amp; Constr. Co-Alaska, 568 P.2d 1007 (Alaska 1977) (decided under former AS 45.09.504).

        Adequacy of findings. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Because the record had no information about disposition of the airplanes that were collateral under a security agreement, the appellate court could not evaluate the superior court's finding that a creditor's failure to give pre-disposition notice was harmless.

        Failure to give notice does not prevent showing that collateral retained. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The creditor’s failure to give notice of intention to retain the collateral in discharge of the debt does not prevent the debtor from showing that the collateral was in fact retained by the creditor and on the basis of such fact he may claim that he is discharged from further liability. Moran v. Holman, 514 P.2d 817 (Alaska 1973) (decided under former AS 45.09.505).

      <p>
       When a secured party retains collateral that depreciates in value, such as a motor vehicle, for an unduly long period of time and uses the vehicle as his own, the debtor may validly claim that his obligation has been satisfied.
       To rule otherwise would permit overreaching and inequitable abuses by some secured parties. Moran v. Holman, 514 P.2d 817 (Alaska 1973) (decided under former AS 45.09.505).

       Where the seller sold two business to the buyer in two separate transactions, the parties entered into a security agreement that secured the promissory note; the seller filed a financing statement covering the assets and inventory. Because the buyer was not harmed by the overbroad financing statement, the trial court erred by awarding it damages after holding that the seller used his overbroad financing statement to “leverage” a $60,000 settlement payment as part of the resale of one of the businesses.

       The burden is on the secured party to prove by clear and convincing evidence the value of the collateral. Hoch v. Ellis, 627 P.2d 1060 (Alaska 1981) (decided under former AS 45.09.504).
      </p>
      <p>
       When it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the value of the collateral is less than the debt, but the exact value of the collateral is not proven to the same standard, the court should proceed to determine the value of the collateral.
       The burden of proof as to this question, in the sense of which party bears the risk of losing if the trier of fact is not persuaded, can be said to reside with the creditor under a preponderance of the evidence standard, but burden of proof on this point will seldom, if ever, be important because before the point can be reached the evidence must have shown to a clear and convincing standard that the value is less than the debt. Typically this will be shown by introduction of evidence of a specific value or of a range of values some part of which at least the court has found persuasive. United Bank Alaska v. Dischner, 685 P.2d 90 (Alaska 1984) (decided under former AS 45.09.504).
      </p>
      <p>
       A creditor can rebut the presumption of equality by providing the exact value of the collateral where that value is less than the value of the outstanding debt, but the presumption can also be rebutted by proof that the value of the collateral is less than the amount of the outstanding debt. United Bank Alaska v. Dischner, 685 P.2d 90 (Alaska 1984) (decided under former AS 45.09.504).

       If the secured party fails to rebut the presumption that the fair market value of the collateral was at least equal to the amount of the outstanding debt, then the presumption leads to the conclusion that the entire debt is discharged.

      <p>
       Ordinarily, the secured creditor establishes that the duty to conduct a sale of the collateral, after a default, in a “commercially reasonable” manner has been fulfilled by showing that the collateral was sold for its fair market value. Kobuk Eng'g &amp; Contracting Servs. v. Superior Tank &amp; Constr. Co-Alaska, 568 P.2d 1007 (Alaska 1977) (decided under former AS 45.09.504).
      </p>
      <p>
       Determination of whether a sale at retail or wholesale is commercially reasonable depends upon the circumstances in each case and is therefore a question of fact. Dischner v. United Bank Alaska, 725 P.2d 488 (Alaska 1986) (decided under former AS 45.09.504).

        Private sale of a tractor

       was prohibited by former AS 45.09.504(c), and thus was commercially unreasonable, because a tractor is not customarily sold in a recognized market and is not the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations.

       After August 27, 1980, a new mobile home sold by a mobile home dealer to a buyer is subject to a mobile home warranty. A mobile home warranty shall be set out in a separate written document entitled “Mobile Home Warranty,” which shall be delivered to the buyer by the mobile home dealer at the time a contract of sale is signed. The warranty must contain the name, address, and telephone number of the mobile home manufacturer and the mobile home dealer and must include at least the following provisions:
       <ol>
        <li id="t45c30s45.30.011ol1a1">
         the mobile home is free from any substantial defects in materials and workmanship;
        </li>
        <li id="t45c30s45.30.011ol1a2">
         the manufacturer or dealer, or both, shall take appropriate action at the site of the mobile home to correct substantial defects in materials or workmanship that become evident within one year of the date of delivery of the mobile home to the buyer if the buyer, or a transferee of the buyer, gives written notice of the defect by registered or certified mail addressed to the business address of the manufacturer or dealer on a date that is not more than one year and 10 days after date of delivery of the mobile home;
        </li>
        <li id="t45c30s45.30.011ol1a3">
         the manufacturer and the dealer are jointly and severally liable to the buyer, or a transferee of the buyer, for the fulfillment of the terms of warranty, and the buyer may notify the manufacturer or the dealer, or both, in the event action is required to correct substantial defects in materials or workmanship;
        </li>
        <li id="t45c30s45.30.011ol1a4">
         the warranty is applicable to the mobile home structure, its plumbing, heating, and electrical systems, and all appliances and equipment installed or included in the mobile home unit by the manufacturer or dealer; and
        </li>
        <li id="t45c30s45.30.011ol1a5">
         notwithstanding separate warranties applicable to appliances contained within a mobile home unit issued by the manufacturers of the appliances, primary responsibility for appropriate corrective action under the warranty rests with the manufacturer and the dealer of the mobile home unit, and written notice of defects must be initially reported to them.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t45c30s45.30.011ol1b">
       The warranty provided under (a) of this section is in addition to, and not in derogation of, all other rights and remedies that a buyer may have under any other law or instrument.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c30s45.30.011ol1c">
       The manufacturer and the dealer may not require the buyer to waive the buyer’s rights under (a) of this section.  A waiver of rights required by a manufacturer or dealer is contrary to public policy and is unenforceable.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c30s45.30.011ol1d">
       A mobile home dealer shall display a notice of reasonable size stating the applicability of the warranty required by this section, and shall, upon request, provide a sample copy of the warranty.  The notice shall be posted in each area in which purchase orders and sales contracts for mobile homes are written.
      </li>

      The federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2301 et seq., preempts the following five elements of the state’s Mobile Home Warranty Act: (1) the requirement of a separate document found in subsection (a) of this section; (2) the requirement that the warranty be entitled “Mobile Home Warranty” also found in subsection (a) of this section; (3) the second requirement of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, that the warranty disclose to the buyer that the manufacturer and the dealer are jointly and severally liable to the buyer for the fulfillment of the terms of the warranty; (4) the requirement of disclosure, found in paragraph (a)(5), that the substantive obligation of primary responsibility for appropriate corrective action concerning appliances under the warranty rests with the manufacturer and the dealer; the mobile home warranty document must still disclose that it covers appliances installed or included in the mobile home; (5) the requirement that mobile home dealers display a notice of reasonable size stating the applicability of the warranty required by this section and to provide a sample copy of the warranty, and the requirement that this notice be posted in each area where purchase orders and sales contracts are made found in subsection (d) of this section. June 12, 1985, Op. Att’y Gen. (661-85-0607).

       <p>
        Since until a valid judgment is rendered against the insured or a settlement agreement is entered into, the insured is not liable to pay damages to the injured party, the sum that the insurance company may eventually pay on behalf of the insured, including post-judgment interest, is not “due” at the time of the injury, but rather at the time of settlement or judgment. Guin v. Ha, 591 P.2d 1281 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although an agreement between the insurer and the insured does not obligate the insurer to pay interest accruing after entry of judgment, an obligation to pay post-judgment interest would arise on behalf of the insurer when judgment is rendered against the insured or a settlement agreement is finalized, since upon the occurrence of either event the insurer would become obligated to make payment under its liability agreement, and the insurer’s obligation would therefore become “due” within the meaning of subsection (a) of this section. Thus, the insurer would be responsible for interest accruing after the date of entry of judgment or settlement. Guin v. Ha, 591 P.2d 1281 (Alaska 1979).

       </p>
       <p>
        For the period prior to the effective date of the 1976 amendment to this section, a claimant is entitled to recover interest on the judgment at the rate of only six percent per annum and a court’s award of interest at eight percent for that period is excessive.

        Classified as an item of compensatory damage, prejudgment interest falls within the liability damage clause in an insurance contract and is subject to the amount limitation contained therein. Thus, when an insurer pays on behalf of its insured the limits of liability coverage to an injured third party, it discharges its obligation under the insurance policy. Guin v.

         Factors in determining whether usurious loan involved. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether a purported lease or sale arrangement involves a usurious loan, several indicia are frequently relied on by the courts. These include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) intention of any of the parties to create a loan or extension of credit; (2) discussion between the vendor and vendee of financing possibilities or efforts by the vendee to seek financing elsewhere; (3) existence of a close relationship between a vendor and a financier; (4) proof of a normal business practice to assign paper shortly after a transaction is consummated; (5) relation of the price the vendor receives for his paper and his cash selling price; and (6) computation of the excess (time-price) charges in a manner in which loan interest is usually computed. McGalliard v. Liberty Leasing Co., 534 P.2d 528 (Alaska 1975), overruled, Western Enters., Inc. v. Arctic Office Machs., Inc., 667 P.2d 1232 (Alaska 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In its efforts to determine whether a purported lease or sale arrangement involves a usurious loan, the trial court must look to the essential relationship of the parties and the substance of the transaction, rather than to one isolated aspect of the transaction. McGalliard v. Liberty Leasing Co., 534 P.2d 528 (Alaska 1975), overruled, Western Enters., Inc. v. Arctic Office Machs., Inc., 667 P.2d 1232 (Alaska 1983).

        It was error to dismiss a debtor's usury counterclaim because (1) the debtor had standing, which was not waived, as the debtor's house's foreclosure satisfied debts from usurious loans on which the debtor paid, (2) a lender's funding fee was interest, so interest above the maximum rate was charged, even though the usury statute did not apply once loan modifications brought principal above $25,000, and the debtor could not recover until payments exceeded loan principal plus lawful interest, as (3) the lender's foreclosure sale proceeds paid all principal and interest, and (4) the claim was not time-barred, since foreclosure proceeds were paid shortly before the claim was raised.

        What is deemed usury. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       As a general rule any benefit or advantage exacted by the lender from the borrower, whatever be its name or form, which, added to the interest taken or reserved, would yield to the lender a greater profit upon his loan than is allowed by law, is deemed usury.
       Fidelity Sec. Corp. v. Brugman, 137 Or. 38, 1 P.2d 131 (1931)(Construing similar Oregon statute)
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Requisites for the presence of usury
       </b>
       are (1) an unlawful intent; (2) the subject-matter must be money or money’s equivalent; (3) a loan or forbearance; (4) the sum loaned must be absolutely, not contingently, repayable; and (5) there must be an exaction for the use of the loan or something in excess of what is allowed by law.
       Lorber v. Marshall (Ore.), 264 P. 438 (1928), (Construing similar Oregon statute)
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the requisite elements of a usurious contract is a corrupt intent to take more than the legal rate of interest for the sum loaned.
       Fidelity Sec. Corp. v. Brugman, 137 Or. 38, 1 P.2d 131 (1931)(Construing similar Oregon statute)
      </p>
      <p>
       The essential elements of usury are: (1) an agreement to lend money or its equivalent or to forbear requiring repayment for a period of time; (2) a borrower’s obligation to repay absolutely, not upon some contingency; (3) greater compensation for making the loan or agreeing to forbear than allowed by the applicable state constitution or usury statute; and (4) an intention to violate the usury prohibition.

       In an action by a national banking association against one of its directors to recover damages alleged to have been caused by an excessive loan in violation of the provisions of the National Banking Act, the directors will be permitted to show the nature and origin of the entire transaction, and usurious interest found to be included with the principal of the note will be deducted in determining whether or not the loan is excessive.

        Presumption of intent to exact usury. —

      <p>
       Unless the applicable statute requires knowledge or willfulness (which this section does not) then the intent required to constitute usury is not necessarily a consciousness of the illegality of the transaction.
       It is sufficient that the loan contract unequivocally calls for an excessive rate of return on the indebtedness.
       In such case, the intent to exact usury is presumed. Metcalf v. Bartrand, 491 P.2d 747 (Alaska 1971).

       In the case of a secured or unsecured instrument loan not exceeding the principal amount of $10,000 (not including interest) which is repayable in substantially equal installments over a period not exceeding seven years, a lender of money may contract for a charge at a rate not exceeding $6 a year for each $100 (true annual interest rate for “add-on method” of computation at a rate not to exceed 11.1 percent; or true annual interest rate for “discount method” of computation at a rate not to exceed 11.8 percent) upon the original face amount of the instrument evidencing the loan for the entire period of the loan. This charge may be collected in advance.  However, if the unpaid balance outstanding on a loan is paid before maturity, the lender shall give a refund or credit of the unearned portion of the charge, which refund or credit represents at least as great a proportion of the original charge as the sum of the periodical time balances after the date of prepayment bears to the sum of all the periodical time balances under the schedule of payments in the original instrument.  The lender is not required to refund or credit any portion of the unearned charge that would result in a net charge on a loan less than the minimum charge provided for in this section, or to make a refund or credit where the amount of the refund or credit computed as set out in this section would be less than $5 for each loan paid before the maturity date.

This advertising requirement may be complied with by stating the equivalent percentage rate that would earn the charge for a loan repayable in 12 equal consecutive monthly installments, and the stated rate may be closely approximate, rather than exact, if the statement so indicates.  This requirement does not apply to an advertisement in which an amount, or rate of charge, is indicated only by a table that contains and is confined to examples of the face amount of the loan instrument, the proceeds to the borrower exclusive of the charge, and the amount, number, and intervals of the required payments.

      A manufacturer who sells an assistive technology device or a mobility aid to a consumer, either directly or through a dealer, shall furnish the consumer with an express warranty stating that the assistive technology device or mobility aid is free from any nonconformity. The duration of the express warranty shall be not less than one year after first delivery of the assistive technology device or mobility aid to a consumer. If a manufacturer fails to furnish an express warranty as required by this section, the assistive technology device or mobility aid shall be covered by the express warranty as if the manufacturer had furnished an express warranty to the consumer as required by this section.

      A provision, clause, covenant, or agreement contained in, collateral to, or affecting a construction contract that purports to indemnify the promisee against liability for damages for (1) death or bodily injury to persons, (2) injury to property, (3) design defects, or (4) other loss, damage or expense arising under (1), (2), or (3) of this section from the sole negligence or wilful misconduct of the promisee or the promisee’s agents, servants, or independent contractors who are directly responsible to the promisee, is against public policy and is void and unenforceable; however, this provision does not affect the validity of an insurance contract, workers’ compensation, or agreement issued by an insurer subject to the provisions of AS 21, or a provision, clause, covenant, or agreement of indemnification respecting the handling, containment, or cleanup of oil or hazardous substances as defined in AS 46.

        Legislative intent. —

      <p>
       The absence in this section of an exemption for limitation of liability clauses indicates that the legislature did not intend to allow an exemption. City of Dillingham v. CH2M Hill Northwest, Inc., 873 P.2d 1271 (Alaska 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The word “indemnify” as used in this section means
       </b>
       “exempt,” and thus this section prohibits limitation of liability clauses; absent legislative action to the contrary, such an interpretation best fulfills the legislature’s express intent to prevent a party to a construction contract from bargaining away liability for the party’s negligent acts. City of Dillingham v. CH2M Hill Northwest, Inc., 873 P.2d 1271 (Alaska 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Applicability of section. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section became effective on September 23, 1975, and governs contracts executed on or after that date. Contracts executed before that date are governed by the rule announced in Burgess Constr. Co. v. State, 614 P.2d 1380 (Alaska 1980), that an indemnity clause is effective to shift responsibility for an accident where the indemnitee is negligent and the indemnitor is not. Stephan &amp; Sons v. Municipality of Anchorage, 629 P.2d 71 (Alaska 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no indication in the text of this section itself that would indicate that the statute is intended to ban only indemnification clauses that would benefit a public promisee at the expense of a private promisor. City of Dillingham v. CH2M Hill Northwest, Inc., 873 P.2d 1271 (Alaska 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section applies to a clause that is questioned under this statute regardless of whether indemnification has been sought. City of Dillingham v. CH2M Hill Northwest, Inc., 873 P.2d 1271 (Alaska 1994).
      </p>

       <b>
        Section applicable to equipment leases. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section should be applied to void indemnity clauses in equipment lease agreements if such a legal rule would advance the purposes of the anti-indemnity statute by inducing careful inspection and use of the leased equipment. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Marion Equip. Co., 894 P.2d 664 (Alaska 1995).
      </p>

       <b>
        When state is solely negligent. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section should come into effect only when it is determined, as between the state and contractors, that the state is solely negligent. Rogers &amp; Babler v. State, 713 P.2d 795 (Alaska 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Wilful misconduct” does not require intent to harm. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wilful misconduct means volitional action taken either with a knowledge that serious injury to another will possibly result, or with wanton and reckless disregard of the possible results. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Marion Equip. Co., 894 P.2d 664 (Alaska 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the insured was found by a jury to have acted with reckless disregard of the plaintiff’s interests and safety, the insured’s injurious behavior is properly termed wilful misconduct. Consequently, this section forbids the indemnity the insurer seeks. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Marion Equip. Co., 894 P.2d 664 (Alaska 1995).

       <b>
        Indemnity clause not invalidated. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Indemnity agreements between a hospital and a general contractor, and between the general contractor and a subcontractor did not violate this section because neither indemnity agreement purported to indemnify any of the parties against liability for death or injury due to the sole negligence or wilful misconduct of the promises. Hoffman Constr. Co. v. U.S. Fabrication &amp; Erection, Inc., 32 P.3d 346 (Alaska 2001).

     </p>
     
     <p>
      Consumers Have the Right to Obtain a Security Freeze You may obtain a security freeze on your credit report and credit score for $5 to protect your privacy and ensure that credit is not granted in your name without your knowledge. You may not have to pay the $5 charge if you are a victim of identity theft. You have a right to place a security freeze on your credit report and credit score under state law ( — ). AS

      The security freeze will prohibit a consumer credit reporting agency from releasing your credit score and any information in your credit report without your express authorization or approval. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and other services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report and credit score may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, a mortgage, a governmental service, a governmental payment, a cellular telephone, a utility, an Internet credit card application, an extension of credit at point of sale, and other items and services. When you place a security freeze on your credit report and credit score, within 10 business days, you will be provided a personal identification number, password, or similar device to use if you choose to remove the freeze on your credit report and credit score or to temporarily authorize the release of your credit report and credit score to a specific third party or specific third parties or for a specific period of time after the freeze is in place. To provide that authorization, you must contact the consumer credit reporting agency and provide all of the following:
      (1) proper identification to verify your identity;
      (2) the personal identification number, password, or similar device provided by the consumer credit reporting agency;
      (3) proper information necessary to identify the third party or third parties who are authorized to receive the credit report and credit score or the specific period of time for which the credit report and credit score are to be available to third parties. A consumer credit reporting agency that receives your request to temporarily lift a freeze on a credit report and credit score is required to comply with the request within 15 minutes, except after normal business hours and under certain other conditions, after receiving your request if you make the request by telephone, or an electronic method if the agency provides an electronic method, or within three business days after receiving your request if you make the request by mail. The consumer credit reporting agency may charge you $2 to temporarily lift the freeze. A security freeze does not apply to circumstances where you have an existing account relationship and a copy of your credit report and credit score are requested by your existing creditor or its agents or affiliates for certain types of account review, collection, fraud control, or similar activities. If you are actively seeking credit, you should understand that the procedures involved in lifting a security freeze may slow your own applications for credit. You should plan ahead and lift a freeze, either completely if you are shopping around, or specifically for a certain creditor, days before applying for new credit. You have a right to bring a civil action against someone who violates your rights under these laws on security freezes. The action can be brought against a consumer credit reporting agency.

       Superior court erred in granting partial summary judgment to a member of an LLC, and in finding that the statute of limitations barred a second member's counterclaims, because the second member's counterclaims were compulsory. The counterclaims were "logically related" and automatically related back to the first member's 2013 cross-claims, the first member's pleadings related back to his 2007 original cross-complaint since they focused on the transactions or occurrences that caused the LLC's losses, and the relation back to the 2007 cross-complaint allowed the second member to "escape the bar of the statutes of limitations."

       , the court predicted that the Alaska Supreme Court would hold that the voluntary payment doctrine (VPD), which is a common law defense that, if applied, would essentially amount to a waiver of the protections of the Alaska Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act (UTPCPA), would be against public policy and thus would not be a viable defense to plaintiff's UTPCPA claim.

        The Federal Fair Debt Practices Act,
       </b>
       15 U.S.C. §§ 1692-1692o, expands already existing Federal Trade Commission jurisdiction over unfair or deceptive acts and practices of collection agencies; it is not written on a clean slate.
       The Federal Trade Commission’s prior exercise of jurisdiction in this area is entitled to great weight, and leads to the conclusion that the new act merely supplements the old. State v. O'Neill Investigations, 609 P.2d 520 (Alaska 1980) (15 U.S.C. § 1692p was added in 2006).

      Due process in exercising right of judicial review. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Since a petition to modify or set aside the investigative demand automatically tolls the penalty provisions of subsection (g) of this section, it cannot be said that appellants exercise the right of judicial review only at the risk of incurring severe penalties. Appellants were accorded a statutory right to challenge the validity of the state’s investigative demand and this is all that due process requires. That appellants must initiate such proceedings does not indicate otherwise. Matanuska Maid v. State, 620 P.2d 182 (Alaska 1980), overruled in part, Rosen v. State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy, 689 P.2d 478 (Alaska 1984).

     An investigative demand issued to appellants failed to adequately apprise them of their right to challenge the demand or to inform them of a procedure for affecting such a challenge when the only notice of such rights contained in the demand was an excerpt from subsection (g) of this section. Matanuska Maid v. State, 620 P.2d 182 (Alaska 1980), overruled in part, Rosen v. State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy, 689 P.2d 478 (Alaska 1984).

     A demand for documents may be issued without prior judicial review, and it is sufficient for 4th amendment purposes that the subpoena is issued pursuant to lawful authority, relevant to the inquiry for which it is issued, and contains adequate specification of the documents to be produced. Matanuska Maid v. State, 620 P.2d 182 (Alaska 1980), overruled in part, Rosen v. State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy, 689 P.2d 478 (Alaska 1984).

    <p>
     There is no conflict between subsection (f) of this section and Civ. R. 91(c), which merely states that if a proceeding to compel production to enforce an administrative subpoena is brought the civil rules shall apply, because the hearing in the present case was not a proceeding in court to compel production but was rather a hearing to modify or set aside the investigative demand. Matanuska Maid v. State, 620 P.2d 182 (Alaska 1980), overruled in part, Rosen v. State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy, 689 P.2d 478 (Alaska 1984).

       It is unlawful for a person to acquire and hold, directly or indirectly, the whole or a part of the stock, or other share capital, or assets of any corporation after August 5, 1975 if the effect of the acquisition and holding may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce in the state or in a section of the state. This subsection does not apply to persons purchasing such stock solely for investment if it is not used by voting or otherwise to bring about, or in attempting to bring about, the substantial lessening of competition.  Nothing in this subsection prevents a corporation from causing the formation of subsidiary corporations for the actual carrying on of their immediate lawful business, or the natural and legitimate branches or extensions of it, or from owning and holding all or a part of the stock of the subsidiary corporation, when the effect of the formation is not substantially to lessen competition.

       A private litigant seeking treble damages for violation of the antitrust laws must establish that it has standing to bring suit. KOS ex rel. Sourdough Freight Lines v. Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co., 676 P.2d 1069 (Alaska 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       To bring suit for treble damages, a plaintiff must show not only the fact of injury from the alleged violation, but that the injury is of the type the antitrust laws are intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes the defendants’ acts unlawful.

       Settlement between fishers and fish processors did not compensate the fishers for underpayment on specific sales of fish, but rather, compensated them for economic losses incurred because of the alleged conspiracy of the processors to set artificially low prices; as neither the basic allegations of the antitrust action nor the actual provisions of the disputed settlement corresponded to any particular sale within the borough, no basis existed for characterizing the settlement money as a post-season adjustment to taxable sales.

      <p>
       In a doctor’s antitrust case against a hospital, because he only prevailed on common law claims, he was not entitled to recovery under the full reasonable fees standard of paragraph (a)(1) of this section; rather, under Alaska R.

       Since a petition to modify or set aside the investigative demand automatically tolls the penalty provisions of subsection (g) of this section, it cannot be said that appellants exercise the right of judicial review only at the risk of incurring severe penalties. Appellants were accorded a statutory right to challenge the validity of the state’s investigative demand and this is all that due process requires. That appellants must initiate such proceedings does not indicate otherwise. Matanuska Maid v. State, 620 P.2d 182 (Alaska 1980), overruled in part, Rosen v. State Bd. of Pub.

       There is no conflict between subsection (f) of this section and Civ. R. 91(c), which merely states that if a proceeding to compel production to enforce an administrative subpoena is brought the civil rules shall apply, because the hearing in the present case was not a proceeding in court to compel production but was rather a hearing to modify or set aside the investigative demand.

       The state cannot be expected to know with certainty the exact nature of a suspected violation.

       Outside law firm was part of the team that the attorney general had assembled to conduct investigations into the oil company’s pricing of gasoline and fell within the circle of those having direct authority to inspect the documents, constituting an “authorized employee” for purposes of subsection (e); the state was not required to show good cause each time it needed to hire outside legal counsel.

      </p>
      <p>
       Assessment of penalties for failure to comply with the investigative demand are dependent upon the absence of a court order issued in response to a petition to modify or set aside the demand under subsection (f) of this section. Accordingly, such a petition, if timely filed would, in effect, toll the penalty provision in subsection (g) of this section during the pendency of the proceeding. Matanuska Maid v. State, 620 P.2d 182 (Alaska 1980), overruled in part, Rosen v. State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy, 689 P.2d 478 (Alaska 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the court is specifically empowered by subsection (f) of this section to extend the return date of the demand, there is no obstacle to extending that date until all issues presented in the petition are resolved by the court. Matanuska Maid v. State, 620 P.2d 182 (Alaska 1980), overruled in part, Rosen v. State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy, 689 P.2d 478 (Alaska 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       A person served with an investigative demand suffers no penalty for noncompliance as long as a petition, timely filed under subsection (f), is pending. Matanuska Maid v. State, 620 P.2d 182 (Alaska 1980), overruled in part, Rosen v. State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy, 689 P.2d 478 (Alaska 1984).

       Subsection (g) of this section punishes only “wilful” disobedience. A sensible construction of this language is that one who files a petition to modify or set aside an investigative demand does not act in willful disobedience of the demand and is therefore not subject to the penalty provisions of subsection (g). Matanuska Maid v. State, 620 P.2d 182 (Alaska 1980), overruled in part, Rosen v. State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy, 689 P.2d 478 (Alaska 1984).

       Disclosure under subsection (a) is permitted when a requesting party shows that the information to be disclosed would likely be fair game for discovery in pending civil litigation and is sought for purposes compatible with the underlying purposes of the state’s investigation. Novak v. Orca Oil Co., 875 P.2d 756 (Alaska 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a private party seeks information under subsection (e) in aid of civil litigation against the party from whom the information was obtained, an appropriate starting point for determining good cause is the general discovery standard set forth in Alaska Civil Rule 26(b)(1).

       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding good cause to allow appellant access to attorney general’s investigatory files where there was a close similarity between the attorney general’s investigation and appellant’s counterclaim; the state joined in appellant’s request for disclosure, and the court’s order was expressly tailored to allow appellee to claim privilege as to any of the documents it had provided to the state in response to the civil investigative demand.

However, the person may nevertheless be prosecuted or subjected to penalty or forfeiture for a perjury, false swearing, or contempt committed in answering or failing to answer.  If a person refuses to testify after being granted immunity from prosecution and after being ordered to testify, the person may be adjudged in contempt and committed to jail until the time the person purges the contempt by testifying. A grant of immunity does not prevent the attorney general from instituting civil contempt proceedings against a person who violates any of the above provisions.

      <p>
       Claim for misappropriation of a trade secret in a dispute involving bids to upgrade remote village power services failed. There was no evidence that an agency employee acquired proprietary information by improper means when it was freely given to him, and it was not shown that the employee disclosed specific proprietary information to another bidder or any other party. Although a confidentiality agreement was sent to the agency, it was not clear whether the employee actually saw the agreement. Powercorp Alaska, LLC v.

        Determination of existence of a trade secret. —

      </p>
      <p>
       There was a genuine issue of material fact relating to whether wiring and programming information related to systems for providing off-grid power to remote villages constituted a trade secret and, if so, the scope of information falling under the definition of trade secret. There was evidence concerning the value of the information, and how difficult it would have been for others to properly acquire or duplicate it; moreover, there was an effort to keep the information secret due to the submission of a confidentiality agreement.

        Materiality under common law. —

      <p>
       Under Alaska common law, a misrepresentation is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.
       Subjective proof that one or more shareholders actually granted a proxy because of a falsehood is not required; only the objective standard encompassed in the definition of materiality need be met. Brown v. Ward, 593 P.2d 247 (Alaska 1979).

       Where the misrepresented ability of a regional corporation to distribute money or land to shareholders on the large scale expressed in the solicitation would be likely to influence shareholders to grant proxies to the solicitor, the proxy solicitations were materially false as a matter of law. Brown v. Ward, 593 P.2d 247 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where shareholders ran as candidates for Alaska Native regional corporation’s board, and the corporation sued the shareholders for materially false or misleading proxy solicitation statements, some of those proxy solicitation statements were materially false as a matter of law.

       Trial court did not err in finding that the totality of the information provided by the corporation in proxy solicitations was not materially misleading; under this section of the Alaska Securities Act, the trial judge did not wrongly impose a scienter requirement in deciding the issue of materiality of the misrepresentations, and did not err in finding that the information omitted from the corporation’s preliminary packet and post-solicitation oral communications was not material.

       In a corporation’s suit successfully challenging as false and misleading proxy solicitations that inaccurately suggested the corporation was being liquidated and was denying shareholders their rights, a personal interest in election as a director motivated unsuccessful counterclaims alleging unfair election procedures; award of attorney fees under the Alaska R. Civ. Proc. 82 fee schedule was proper. Rude v. Cook Inlet Region, Inc., 294 P.3d 76 (Alaska 2012).

       The trial court’s use of criminal recklessness as a measure of the criminal intent requirement applicable to defendant’s charges of selling unregistered securities fully complied with the court’s duty to inform the jury that defendant could be convicted only if he acted with an awareness of wrongdoing. Wheeler v. State, 659 P.2d 1241 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       In prosecution for selling unregistered securities, the advice of counsel instruction given by the trial court adequately apprised defendant’s jury of the relationship between reliance on advice of counsel and the element of willfulness. Wheeler v. State, 659 P.2d 1241 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court did not err in refusing to give a proposed instruction stating that a good faith belief on defendant’s part that he was not offering a security for sale would be a defense where the trial court did give a more specific instruction that good faith reliance on advice of an attorney would constitute a defense to the counts charging defendant with sale of unregistered securities.

A broker-dealer or issuer does not violate this subsection if the broker-dealer or issuer did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care, could not have known of the suspension, revocation, or bar. Upon request from a broker-dealer or issuer and for good cause, an order under this chapter may modify or waive, in whole or in part, the application of the prohibitions of this subsection to the broker-dealer.

      The zoning power vested in the Department of Natural Resources under this section is broad enough to encompass the creation of historical districts as a control over the land use, but the exercise of that authority does not make the property eligible for historic preservation loans under AS 45.98, which is aimed solely at historic districts established by municipalities.
