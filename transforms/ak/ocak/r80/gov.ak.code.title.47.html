     <p>
      The purpose of this title as it relates to children is to secure for each child the care and guidance, preferably in the child’s own home, that will serve the moral, emotional, mental, and physical welfare of the child and the best interests of the community; to preserve and strengthen the child’s family ties unless efforts to preserve and strengthen the ties are likely to result in physical or emotional damage to the child, removing the child from the custody of the parents only as a last resort when the child’s welfare or safety or the protection of the public cannot be adequately safeguarded without removal; and, when the child is removed from the family, to secure for the child adequate custody and care and adequate planning for permanent placement of the child. It is the policy of the state to acknowledge and take into account the principles of early childhood and youth brain development and, whenever possible, consider the concepts of early adversity, toxic stress, childhood trauma, and the promotion of resilience through protective relationships, supports, self-regulation, and services.

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that among several factors, many of which weighed equally between the parties, the child’s continuous residence with foster parents for 30 of his 37 months by the end of trial took on the most importance; this did not amount to a single factor outweighing all others in applying the “best interests of the child” standard and accorded with the finding in AS

       Superior court properly reinstated a mother's parental rights because it was not clearly erroneous to find that the mother and her sister were similarly situated with respect to their bonds with the child, who had lived with the sister; over two years passed between the initial reinstatement order and the superior court's supplemental findings, and the superior court most heavily weighed the child's emotional well-being, namely his ability to maintain all familial bonds.

        Child’s need for permanency. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court may consider a child’s need for permanency at the time of a termination trial when making its best interest determination, as the legislature has recognized that children under six can suffer significant emotional damage if they do not have permanency in their lives. Ralph H. v. State, 255 P.3d 1003 (Alaska 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Young children have unique needs for permanency and bonding. At the time of termination, the child was only eight months old. He had spent his entire life in his grandmother’s care and had developed a strong bond with his grandmother and his older sister. It was in his best interests to remain with the grandmother, and the best interests of the child, not the parent, are paramount. Mother had not bonded with her son and had continued her long-time abuse of cocaine both during and after the pregnancy. Amy M. v. State, Dep't of Health &amp; Soc. Servs., 320 P.3d 253 (Alaska 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not an abuse of discretion to deny a father a termination trial continuance because the father showed no serious prejudice by showing the father could timely remedy conduct causing the father's child to be in need of aid, as (1) a short continuance did not provide enough time for needed services, and (2) a long continuance was not in the child's best interests.

       Remand on the mother's request for reinstatement of parental rights was necessary because, despite stating it considered the factors in this section, the court did not make any findings about the child's best interest.
       Dara S. v. State, 426 P.3d 975 (Alaska 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the disputed factual findings supporting the best interests determination were not material or not clearly erroneous, the decision granting a mother reinstatement of her parental rights had to be affirmed; the superior court made findings about the child's age, his attachment to caregivers, his opportunities to maintain visitation with those to whom he was bonded, the safety, security, and stability of the mother's home, and the necessity of moving the child from his placement.

       Purpose.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is declared by the legislature as a matter of public concern that the needy persons of this state who are eligible for medical care at public expense under this chapter should seek only uniform and high quality care that is appropriate to their condition and cost-effective to the state and receive that care, regardless of race, age, national origin, or economic standing. It is equally a matter of public concern that providers of services under this chapter should operate honestly, responsibly, and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in order to maintain the integrity and fiscal viability of the state’s medical assistance program, and that those who do not operate in this manner should be held accountable for their conduct. It is vital that the department administer this chapter in a manner that promotes effective, long-term cost containment of the state’s medical assistance expenditures while providing medical care to recipients. Accordingly, this chapter authorizes the department to apply for participation in the national medical assistance program as provided for under 42 U.S.C. 1396 — 1396p (Title XIX, Social Security Act).

       Denial by the Department of Health and Social Services, Division of Medical Assistance, of routine dental services to a severely retarded Medicaid recipient was reversed and the case was remanded for further findings, because the Department abused its discretion by failing to determine whether its “undue hardship” regulation,
       7 AAC 43.080(a) [now repealed], applied; and, as the recipient made a prima facie case of disability-based discrimination under Title II (42 U.S.C.S. § 12132) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Department was obliged to consider reasonable accommodations for the recipient.

       Restrictions placed upon Alaska's Medicaid funding of abortions by a statute and a regulation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Alaska Constitution because the restrictions were not narrowly tailored to meet the ends of preserving Medicaid funds. Moreover, the State of Alaska did not show that the differences between the affected classes—women who chose to have abortions versus women who chose to carry their pregnancies to term—justified the discriminatory treatment that was imposed.

       Alaska Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) violated a hospital’s due process rights under Alaska Const., art. I, § 7 when it used erroneous information to calculate a Medicaid reimbursement rate under 7 AAC 43.685 because application of the regulation was not reasonable since there was no compelling reason for using inaccurate data; however, a superior court should not have ordered DHSS to use a report to calculate the correct rate because that was not the only reasonable method of doing so.

       Although this section authorized the commission prospectively to determine the rate of payment to be made to a health care facility, the statute was silent on the subject of prospective recoupment from a health care facility based on audit results.

Except as provided in (b) of this section, the amount of the supplemental reimbursement paid to a provider must be equal to the amount of federal financial participation that the department receives for the nonfederal matching funds paid by the provider through intergovernmental transfers or certified public expenditures, less any administrative fee described in (d) or (e) of this section. Under the program, the department shall use intergovernmental transfers, or certified public expenditures, or both, for the nonfederal share of emergency medical transportation services that are eligible for federal financial participation under the medical assistance program.

A provider may include the administrative fee in the provider’s cost for providing an emergency medical transportation service to a medical assistance recipient.

       That Alaska CINA R. 16(b) allows a court to order mental and physical examinations of a child’s parents at the predisposition phase of a child-in-need-of-aid proceeding does not limit the court’s authority under Alaska R. Civ. P. 35(a) to order a mental examination at the adjudication stage. Alyssa B. v. Dep't of Health &amp; Social Servs., 123 P.3d 646 (Alaska 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In child-in-need-of-aid proceedings, Alaska R. Civ. P. 35(a) should be invoked cautiously, only after the movant has demonstrated sufficient justification for a mental or physical examination. Alyssa B. v. Dep't of Health &amp; Social Servs., 123 P.3d 646 (Alaska 2005).

       As a mother’s mental state was in controversy because her mental or emotional condition allegedly placed her child at risk within the meaning of paragraph (11) of this section, and there was sufficient evidence to establish good cause for a psychological evaluation, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering her to undergo such an evaluation under Alaska R. Civ. P. 35(a). Alyssa B. v. Dep't of Health &amp; Social Servs., 123 P.3d 646 (Alaska 2005).

       Where a father appealed a superior court’s termination of his parental rights, the superior court did not err when it concluded that termination of the father’s parental rights was in the child’s best interest. The child had special needs that the father simply did not seem to understand.

      </p>
      <p>
       Mother's contention that the appearance of judicial partiality violated her due process rights was rejected because, although the trial court may have exhibited partiality related to whether substance abuse continued to substantially impair the mother's ability to parent, that only impacted one of the grounds for termination of the mother's parental rights. The mother's ability to be heard and adequately represent her interests with respect to the domestic violence and mental illness findings was not prejudiced, and the child's best interests would not be served by delaying permanency and prolonging the judicial proceedings given that the mother had yet to remedy the conduct or conditions that made him a child in need of aid.

       Parent’s substance abuse placed her girls at substantial risk of harm and caused the parent to neglect the girls and on multiple occasions the parent was found passed out and unable to care for the girls; the record adequately supported the lower court’s finding and it did not err in terminating the parent’s parental rights.

       Where a father’s addiction to substances, including alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana, resulted in repeated incarcerations, and he had never completed a substance abuse treatment program, his frequent and prolonged absences impaired his ability to parent and were harmful to his children; thus, a trial court did not err in finding that the children were in need of aid under paragraph (10) of this section.

       Findings were sufficient to support a conclusion that a father’s youngest child was a child in need of aid because the evidence showed that the child was in substantial risk of injury if he returned home. The father’s previous lack of cooperation and the exhaustion of resources mitigated Office of Children Services’ failure to refer the father to service providers in a case plan. Burke P. v. State, 162 P.3d 1239 (Alaska 2007).

      <p>
       While the trial court erred by finding that the son was a child in need of aid as a result of the father’s previous incarceration where the father was not incarcerated at the time of the termination trial, the trial court properly found the son to be a child in need of aid under paragraphs (6), (8), (10), and (11). The evidence showed that the father had a history of violent behavior, he did not comply with his case plan to address his anger, an alcohol assessment concluded that the father was significantly disabled by his alcohol abuse, and some of his acts of violence involved alcohol.

       Trial court did not err in terminating Indian parents’ rights on the basis of neglect because the evidence established that the children were in need of aid based in part on conditions created by the parents that had subjected the children to neglect, including evidence that the father used drugs and the parents permitted others to use drugs in their home, that the children missed almost 80 days of school in one academic year because the parents overslept, that the parents missed visits with the children after the children were taken into state custody, and that the children suffered from significant delays in speech and verbal skills and required dental care when they entered state custody.

      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of father’s right to his children was proper based on finding that the children were in need of aid under paragraph (8) of this section, where the father’s long history of domestic violence against women created a substantial risk of harm to the children if they were placed with him, and the father failed to complete parenting and anger management classes, as witnessing domestic violence is mentally harmful to children; fact that because a parent has never directed violence against his child does not show that the child has not faced “a substantial risk of mental injury” under paragraph (8)(B)(i).

       Where a father was incarcerated for the first 20 months of his child’s life, then was in her life for only five months before disappearing to avoid incarceration on a probation violation, and where there was no evidence that he maintained any contact with her during his flight, a finding of abandonment and termination of his parental rights was proper, especially in light of the child’s young age and the proportion of her life for which the father was absent. David S. v. State, 270 P.3d 767 (Alaska 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of parental rights to Indian children was appropriate because delaying the children's permanency until a parent's release from incarceration likely would have resulted in serious emotional harm given the children's emotional state, the parent's release date, and the parent's inability to care for the children immediately upon release. The testimony of the Office of Children's Services supervisor of family services was sufficient to support the finding.

      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly terminated a father’s parental rights after finding that the children were in need of aid due to abandonment because the father abandoned his children by failing to participate in his case plan; the father’s participation in the case plan was no more than minimal, because although he took some preliminary steps toward completing his case plan, he failed to adequately address his ongoing mental health issues or to undertake any parenting counseling. Further, the father abandoned his children by failing to participate in visitation; the father’s failure to request individual visitation evidenced a willful disregard for parental obligations, and his failure to maintain visitation with his children caused the destruction of the parent-child relationship. Jay W. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Sept. 28, 2015) (memorandum decision).

      <p>
       Termination of a father's parental right did not violate his due process rights where the basis of termination was his abandonment of the child, which was evidenced by his failure to engage with his case plan and his plan for the child's placement with the paternal grandparents, and requiring him to prove that he could provide a safe home for the child was appropriate.

       Superior court did not clearly err in finding that the mother failed to remedy the conduct that made the children in need of aid; the superior court found the children to be in need of aid under the abandonment provisions, and the findings were supported, given the mother's repeated refusals to participate in supervised visits and her departure from the state, along with the failure to return when the children’s services office bought plane tickets for her, and thus a willful disregard for parental obligations was shown.

       When a father engaged in parenting, vocational, and religious instruction while incarcerated, it was on the father's own initiative rather than in response to any guidance from the Alaska Office of Children's Services (OCS) about what the father needed to do to improve the chances of reunification. Therefore, termination of the father's parental rights was inappropriate because the OCS's minimal engagement with the father, combined with the lack of a relevant case plan, meant that the OCS did not make reasonable efforts toward reunification. Duke S. v. State, 433 P.3d 1127 (Alaska 2018).

       Superior court did not err when it accepted the termination petition and subsequently terminated the mother’s parental because the trial occurred about 13 months after the Office of Children’s Services (OCS) removed the child and it found that the mother had failed to participate in services before the adjudication hearing. It noted that, since the adjudication, the mother had been stopped in a truck littered with a “shocking” amount of drugs and related paraphernalia. Nera S. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Mar. 9, 2022).

       In termination of parental rights proceedings, trial court did not err in finding Indian child was a child in need of aid because neither 25 U.S.C.S. § 1912(e) nor state rules required courts to make “removal findings” before extending custody, but additional findings and determinations were needed before Office of Children’s Services’ custody could be extended.

       While the superior court properly rejected a master’s recommendation that there was no probable cause to believe that two of the children were children in need of aid because the matter was moot where the children were in the mother’s custody and the Office of Children’s Services no longer sought to be involved in the parent-child relationship, there was no error in the superior court’s decision that the master’s recommendation that the children be returned home was not effective until the court had reviewed it, however, the 23-day wait in this case between the master’s recommendation and the superior court’s order on review of it was unacceptable.

       Admission of an officer's alleged hearsay statements constituted harmless error as the evidence was sufficient, without the officer's statements, to find that the children were in need of aid, and to terminate the father's parental rights based on his ongoing substance abuse issues because there was evidence of the father's positive drug tests and no-shows for testing; testimony by the mother regarding the father's past drug usage; testimony by a sister-in-law that she found tin foil with a burnt substance on it in the room in her home where the father was staying; and testimony by two different officers who conducted two separate traffic stops where they each suspected the father was under the influence of a controlled substance.

       Termination of a mother’s parental rights was appropriate because the evidence supported the superior court’s findings that the mother’s ongoing substance abuse issues would place the mother’s child at substantial risk of harm if returned to the mother’s care.

       There was no error in the termination of the father’s parental rights because the Office of Children’s Services (OCS) made active efforts to reunify the father’s family.

       Trial court properly terminated a father’s parental rights by determining that his daughter was a child in need of aid. There was sufficient evidence in the record to find that the father had an addiction to prescription and illegal intoxicants; it appeared that many of the father’s legal problems and incarcerations related to his addiction, which resulted in substantial harm to his daughter.

       In terminating a mother’s parental rights, a trial court did not err in concluding that the children were in need of aid because the mother had a long history of alcohol abuse and all three children suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and other serious mental health issues as a result of witnessing domestic violence.

       In a termination of parental rights case, the trial court did not err in finding that the child had been exposed to conduct or conditions specified in this section because the mother did not dispute that she exposed the child to drug addicts, drug dealers, and domestic violence. As the mother refused to fulfill her case plan requirements, which included substance abuse treatment, the trial court did not err by finding she did not remedy her conduct in time for her son to be safely returned to her custody.

       Termination of a father's parental rights to the father's daughter, an Indian child who received treatment for sexualized and aggressive behavior, was appropriate because the superior court reasonably concluded that the father failed to remedy the harmful conduct or conditions, that visitation was not in the child's best interest, that the father had failed to comply with substance abuse testing and delayed a critical sex offender risk assessment, and that it would cause serious emotional damage to return the child to the father's home.

Moreover, he provided no excuse for having failed to complete such tasks in the two years provided, and his argument that he had substantially remedied any alleged harm to the child because he no longer associated with a drug user at the time of trial did nothing to dispel the legitimate concerns that the father had not changed his behaviors so as to place the child's interests first.

       For purposes of this chapter, the court may find abandonment of a child if a parent or guardian has shown a conscious disregard of parental responsibilities toward the child by failing to provide reasonable support, maintain regular contact, or provide normal supervision, considering the child’s age and need for care by an adult. Abandonment of a child also includes instances when the parent or guardian, without justifiable cause,
       <ol>
        <li id="t47c10a01s47.10.013ol1a1">
         left the child with another person without provision for the child’s support and without meaningful communication with the child for a period of three months;

       For purposes of (a) of this section, a parent or guardian who is a victim of domestic violence, or who has a child in the parent’s or guardian’s care who is the victim of domestic violence, is considered to have justifiable cause to take an action or to fail to take an action that would otherwise be considered to be abandonment of a child under (a) of this section if the action or failure to act is necessary to protect the parent or guardian, or a child in the care of the parent or guardian, from further acts of domestic violence. However, a parent or guardian who initially had justifiable cause to act or fail to act as described in this subsection may be considered to have abandoned the child without justifiable cause for purposes of (a) of this section if the parent or guardian does not take reasonable steps to reunify with or provide care for the abandoned child after becoming secure from further acts of domestic violence or after providing that another child in the care of the parent or guardian is secure from further acts of domestic violence.

        Little contact with child over prolonged period. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       State supreme court upheld a trial court’s judgment that a child was a child in need of aid because the child’s father, who was incarcerated in another state and had little contact with the child for 10 years, had abandoned the child, and because the child’s mother created conditions which caused the child to need aid, and the supreme court affirmed the trial court’s judgment that the Alaska Division of Family and Youth Services had satisfied its statutory obligation to make reasonable efforts to reunify the child and the father, and that it was in the child’s best interests to terminate the father’s parental rights. G.C. v. Dep't of Health &amp; Soc. Servs., Div. of Family &amp; Youth Servs., 67 P.3d 648 (Alaska 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of parental rights was appropriate when evidence showed that a great part of the son’s emotional disturbance was attributable to neglect, the instability of caregivers, and violence in the father’s shifting households, as well as poor role modeling in the home; father also failed to maintain contact with his daughter, although he had sought custody of her in the past during periods when he was out of prison. Rick P. v. State, 109 P.3d 950 (Alaska 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Two one-year-long periods without visitation, coupled with the absence of any other forms of communication or support, constituted abandonment by the father. The child’s therapist testified that the father’s absence from the child’s life and subsequent inconsistent visitation aggravated the child’s severe anxiety, interfering with his day-to-day functioning.
       Dan A. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Jan. 13, 2012) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not err by finding the child in need of aid due to abandonment because the father had failed to participate in a case plan as he was out of contact with the Office of Children's Services from February to September 2016 and again from September 2016 to May 2017; and, between the end of the trial home visit in October 2015 and May 2017, the only arguable progress that the father made on his case plan was his self-reported lack of contact with the mother and his family contact with the child.

        Finding of abandonment. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Child was properly found to be in need of aid due to her father’s abandonment because the record established that even though he was working, the father did not provide child support after he was released from jail, and he made only one contact with the child during a 13 month period while the child was in foster care.
       Jon S. v. Dep't of Health &amp; Soc. Servs., 212 P.3d 756 (Alaska 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Father’s inconsistent behavior, sudden lengthy absences, and failure to follow his case plan constituted abandonment. Sherman B. v. State, 290 P.3d 421 (Alaska 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       A father’s parental rights were terminated because he abandoned his children by failing to participate in visitation; the requirement of the Office of Children’s Services that the father visit with the children individually was reasonable, and his failure to request individual visitation evidenced a willful disregard for parental obligations. Further, the father abandoned his children by failing to participate in his case plan; the father’s participation in the case plan was no more than minimal, because although he took some preliminary steps toward completing his case plan, he failed to adequately address his ongoing mental health issues or to undertake any parenting counseling. Jay W. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Sept. 28, 2015) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of a father's parental right did not violate his due process rights where the basis of termination was his abandonment of the child, which was evidenced by his failure to engage with his case plan and his plan for the child's placement with the paternal grandparents, and requiring him to prove that he could provide a safe home for the child was appropriate.
       Louis W. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Mar. 16, 2016) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not clearly err in finding that the mother failed to remedy the conduct that made the children in need of aid; the superior court found the children to be in need of aid under the abandonment provisions, and the findings were supported, given the mother's repeated refusals to participate in supervised visits and her departure from the state, along with the failure to return when the children’s services office bought plane tickets for her, and thus a willful disregard for parental obligations was shown.
       Joy B. v. State, 382 P.3d 1154 (Alaska 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not clear error to find a father abandoned his Indian child because (1) the father did not regularly visit or meaningfully participate in a case plan requiring drug tests and visits, (2) the drug testing was reasonable due to his substance abuse history, presence of other children in the home who tested positive for illegal substances, and failure to show the father's religion or work schedule prevented participating in testing, and (3) the father did not show his work schedule prevented attending visits. Steve H. v. State, 444 P.3d 109 (Alaska 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the superior court clearly erred when it found that a father had failed to remedy the conditions placing his children in need of aid, since its findings concerning “unavailability” were irrelevant to whether the father was released from incarceration, because “unavailability” could be relevant to abandonment, the matter was remanded to the superior court to reconsider its findings in relation to Office of Children's Services' abandonment argument and petition.

       Court properly terminated a father’s parental rights on the basis of abandonment because the father voluntarily left Alaska, and made no attempt to see his son for more than a year, even though he knew that social services was working to help reunite him with the child. A social worker offered to help the father have the no-contact order in his criminal case modified to allow supervised visits with the child even while the criminal case was pending, but the father did not follow up on her offer.

       In determining what “failed to participate” means within the context of paragraph (a)(4), while this statutory provision does not necessarily require a parent to follow his or her reunification plan to the letter, it does require more than minimal participation. A.B. v. Department of Health &amp; Soc. Servs., 7 P.3d 946 (Alaska 2000).

       By failing to even minimally participate in her case plan for over six months, the mother’s conduct fell within the definition of “abandonment” stated in paragraph (a)(4). A.B. v. Department of Health &amp; Soc. Servs., 7 P.3d 946 (Alaska 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court did not err in terminating a father’s parental rights on the ground of abandonment where he failed to comply with his case plan and refused to provide basic contact information so that he could be notified about events in the case and services that might be available; he had not had contact with the children for six years.
       Wilson W. v. State, Dep't of Health &amp; Soc. Servs., — P.3d — (Alaska Sept. 18, 2013) (memorandum decision).

      <p>
       Where a father appealed a superior court’s termination of his parental rights, the superior court did not err when it concluded that the Office of Children’s Services (OCS) made reasonable efforts to reunify the father with his child. The father failed to cooperate with the reasonable services that the OCS provided.
       Sherman B. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Jan. 8, 2014) (memorandum decision).

      <p>
       Father’s failure to comply with a case plan designed to assist him in becoming able to take care of his child was properly held to be abandonment.

      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of parental rights was appropriate because the trial court did not clearly err by finding that a father was not meaningfully engaging in a case plan, but was merely giving lip-service to the providers and was going through the motions.

       Court properly terminated a father’s parental rights on the basis of abandonment where he failed to express any intent to parent the child, he declined the opportunity to speak with the foster mother and participate in a conference regarding the child, and he did not request any visitation until eight months after learning of the child’s existence. Jeff A.C. v. State, 117 P.3d 697 (Alaska 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of a father’s parental rights was proper on the basis of abandonment because, after he had an opportunity to receive counselling and support from the state, the father lost his job, was discharged from counseling for non-compliance, was arrested twice for driving while intoxicated, and failed to communicate these setbacks to the State.

       Findings of abandonment and failure to remedy were supported by evidence that the parent failed to comply with several important aspects of his case plan, including undergoing a psychological assessment, providing verification of housing and employment, and gaining an understanding of the child’s developmental needs and abilities; the Office of Children’s Services presented reasonable justifications for requiring the evaluation, including troubling conduct with his other children.

       Superior court did not err in determining that the Office of Children's Services (OCS) met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that terminating a father's parental rights was in the child's best interests because OCS presented testimony from caseworkers and documented the father's criminal history, incarceration, and history of substance abuse and failed treatment; OCS did not solely rely on an expert's testimony to prove that termination was in the child's best interests.

       Termination of a father's parental rights was inappropriate because it was clear error for the superior court to find that the child was in need of aid on the grounds of abandonment, neglect, and incarceration of the father because the father initiated efforts to visit the child, who was already in the custody of the Alaska Office of Children's Services (OCS), as soon as he learned of his possible paternity.
       Furthermore, the father had visitation during the subsequent incarceration as often as the OCS was able to provide it.

     <p>
      For purposes of this chapter, the court may find neglect of a child if the parent, guardian, or custodian fails to provide the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, education, medical attention, or other care and control necessary for the child’s physical and mental health and development, though financially able to do so or offered financial or other reasonable means to do so.

       Termination of a father's parental rights was inappropriate because it was clear error for the superior court to find that the child was in need of aid on the grounds of neglect because there was no basis in the record for a finding that the father, who was incarcerated, failed to provide support that the father was financially able to provide.

       Superior court did not err in concluding that girls were children in need of aid because there was clear and convincing evidence in the record to support superior court’s finding that the girls had been subjected to neglect due to their mother’s failure to provide them with the care and control necessary for their mental health and development.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in terminating Indian parents’ rights on the basis of neglect because the evidence established that the children were in need of aid based in part on conditions created by the parents that had subjected the children to neglect, including evidence that the father used drugs and the parents permitted others to use drugs in their home, that the children missed almost 80 days of school in one academic year because the parents overslept, that the parents missed visits with the children after the children were taken into state custody, and that the children suffered from significant delays in speech and verbal skills and required dental care when they entered state custody.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by finding the child to be a child in need of aid based on neglect because for some time after the father was incarcerated he refused to provide names of relatives who might be placements, he unlawfully left the halfway house and kidnapped the child from her foster parents, and placed her in a dangerous situation during a police confrontation.

      <p>
       There was sufficient support in the record to find that a mother failed to provide adequate medical attention and other care and control necessary for her children's physical and mental health, and thus, the superior court did not clearly err when it found the children in need of aid due to neglect; the mother failed to provide her son proper medical attention when she declined to take him to therapy, and the neglect of the daughter played a strong role in her continuing mental health issues.

       While some authorities hold that infants, even when represented by counsel, cannot waive defects in process and consent to jurisdiction over the person, such a rule unreasonably restricts the strategic choices open to a child represented by counsel.
       A no-waiver rule could be used as a delaying tactic by an unprepared prosecutor when process was not entirely correct.
       A child represented by competent counsel is about as fit as an adult to waive this sort of objection, which is usually beyond the ken of adult laymen as well as children. RLR v. State, 487 P.2d 27 (Alaska 1971).

       <p>
        Alaska’s pertinent statutory provisions and procedural rules distinguish between categories of children for purposes of administering Alaska children’s laws.
        Of controlling significance is that each class or category mandates distinct differences regarding the permissible content of any dispositional order the trial court can enter. In re E.M.D., 490 P.2d 658 (Alaska 1971).

       </p>
       <p>
        The superior court has the authority to review the decision of the department to determine if the placement is in the best interest of the minor, but in reviewing a decision of the department, the superior court may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the department; since the legislature has committed the decision of placement to the department’s discretion, the question for the court is whether the agency abused its discretion. State, Dep't of Health &amp; Soc. Servs. v. A.C., 682 P.2d 1131 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984); State v. E.E., 912 P.2d 1 (Alaska Ct. App. 1996).

       <p>
        Extension of the state’s pretrial custody of children beyond the initial two-year period allowed by this section was not error given the father’s delay in objecting, the nearness of the trial date at the time of his objection, and his failure to show potential prejudice arising from continued state custody.

       <p>
        Where defendant proposed to return child in state custody to her natural mother and sought extension of state custody to accomplish this gradually, a native village council argued that denial of department’s petition for an extension of custody would not require the superior court then to return the child to her mother, but rather that under subsection (e) the court could release the child to the child’s parents under the tribal court adoption order; however, it was held that the superior court correctly concurred in the state’s position that, absent an extension, the child must be returned to her natural mother.

       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court did not abuse its discretion finding that an extension of custody of a child in need of aid by the department for an additional year, during which time the girl would be transitioned back into her mother’s custody, was in the child’s best interest. Work needed to be done for reunification efforts to succeed, and the superior court’s finding that it was not in the child’s best interests to be immediately returned to her mother was adequately supported by the record.

       </p>
       <p>
        While a parent has a right to the care, custody and control of his or her children, this right is not absolute, and “courts have become increasingly aware of the rights of children.” The Alaska legislature has struck a balance between these potentially competing rights by requiring the state to prove its allegations by clear and convincing evidence in parental rights termination cases.
        Once this burden of proof has been met, however, the statute mandates a termination. In re D.C., 596 P.2d 22 (Alaska 1979).

       </p>
       <p>
        The application of the clear and convincing standard to the findings that a child is in need of aid as a result of parental conduct and that the paternal conduct is likely to continue does not conflict with section 1912(f) (25 U.S.C. § 1912(f)) of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA).
        Section 1912(f) looks to likely future harm to the child, requiring only a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of likely harm to the child with continued custody by the parent or Indian custodian.
        In contrast, this section is concerned with the present condition of the child and the likely future conduct of the parent and requires a finding by clear and convincing evidence that the child is in need of aid as a result of parental conduct and that the parental conduct that placed the child in need of aid is likely to continue. The Alaska statute requires findings additional to that required by the ICWA, thus providing a level of protection to the parental rights beyond that provided by the ICWA, and is not preempted by the ICWA.

        Trial court’s termination of father’s parental rights was erroneous where father could not have visited his children until he had established that he was their father and a period of approximately eighteen months elapsed before paternity of both children was established which resulted from the mother’s refusal, even under court order, to provide blood for testing purposes.

        While long-term incarceration of a parent can result in a child becoming a child in need of aid under an inability to provide care theory, such incarceration is not a sufficient basis to justify termination of parental rights under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

         Foster parent intervention.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Foster parent intervention should be the rare exception rather than the rule but it is not precluded as a matter of law; the statute allows any party to request a hearing to prove that the Office of Children's Services' placement decision is not in the child's best interests. In applying the definition of “party” under the child in need of aid (CINA) rules, the phrase “any other person” includes foster parents when the court properly exercises its discretion to allow them to intervene. Foster parent intervention does not violate CINA statutes.
        State v. Zander B., 474 P.3d 1153 (Alaska 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court did not abuse its discretion in allowing foster parents to intervene for the limited purpose of challenging the decision to place the child with his paternal grandmother, as the foster parents said they had specific evidence about the placement that the court was not going to receive from any existing party; because the foster parents were identified as a pre-adoptive foster placement and attested to their desire to adopt the child, their claim did share a question of law or fact with the placement review, the child's best interests.

         Applicability of burden of proof. —

       <p>
        A burden of proof is not applicable to a dispositive hearing other than when termination of parental rights is involved. In re S. D., 549 P.2d 1190 (Alaska 1976). See also In re C.L.T., 597 P.2d 518 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Determination of the standard to be applied by the court at the dispositive phase of a child hearing was not tantamount to establishing a burden of proof requirement.
        Such a requirement had been set forth in former subsection (c)(3)(D) [see now subsection (c)(3)].
        No such requirement had been set forth in situations such as where termination of parental rights was not involved. In re S. D., 549 P.2d 1190 (Alaska 1976).

        <b>
         Standard of proof held constitutional. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Allowing parental rights to be terminated based on a standard of proof less stringent than “beyond a reasonable doubt” does not violate the due process clause of the United States Constitution or the Alaska Constitution. In re C.L.T., 597 P.2d 518 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since in proceedings brought to terminate parental rights, the parent is neither charged with criminal behavior nor subject to incarceration as a direct consequence of the proceeding, there is nothing in the federal constitution that compels adoption of the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard in termination proceedings. In re C.L.T., 597 P.2d 518 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing proof is a more demanding standard than a mere preponderance of the evidence and is adequate to protect the parent’s substantial interest in his or her child custody rights.
        This evidentiary standard balances the competing interests involved in a proceeding brought to terminate parental rights, one of which is the right of a child to an adequate home. In re C.L.T., 597 P.2d 518 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The due process clause did not require a standard of proof greater than clear and convincing evidence when the state sought to terminate parental rights because of unfitness under former subsection (c)(3)(D). In re C.L.T., 597 P.2d 518 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Standard of proof under former subsection (c)(3)(D) calling for “clear and convincing” evidence of the natural mother’s unfitness for the care and custody of the child was held proper. In re Adoption of S., 543 P.2d 1191 (Alaska 1975).

        Orders made under subsection (c)(3) of this section are not entitled to automatic review, inasmuch as subsection (f) of this section specifies which orders are entitled to this review and orders under subsection (c)(3) of this section are not included within the list. Rita T. v. State, 623 P.2d 344 (Alaska 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        All orders made pursuant to this section, including orders under subsection (c)(3) of this section, are to be reviewed upon application of an interested party if the party establishes good cause for the review, and if the child is still a ward of the court. Rita T. v. State, 623 P.2d 344 (Alaska 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        As long as a child remains the ward of the court, under subsection (f) of this section his or her natural parents are entitled to a review of the order terminating their parental rights upon a showing of good cause for the hearing. Rita T. v. State, 623 P.2d 344 (Alaska 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Good cause could be established if the parents showed that it would be in the best interests of the child to resume living with them because they have sufficiently rehabilitated themselves so that they can provide proper guidance and care for the child. Rita T. v. State, 623 P.2d 344 (Alaska 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, when a mother applied for a hearing before the superior court, she indicated that as a result of a 14-month rehabilitation program she had overcome the problems that had led to the termination of her parental rights and also indicated that professional counselors, social workers and others would be able to establish that she was now capable of providing a warm and loving home for the child, this was a sufficient showing of good cause to entitle her to a review of the order terminating her parental rights if the child had not yet been adopted. Rita T. v. State, 623 P.2d 344 (Alaska 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Office of Children's Services is afforded an extremely high degree of discretion, and whether the office abused its discretion is a mixed question of law and fact. State v. Zander B., 474 P.3d 1153 (Alaska 2020).

This relationship imposes on the department and its authorized agents or the parents, guardian, or other suitable person the responsibility of physical care and control of the child, the determination of where and with whom the child shall live, the right and duty to protect, nurture, train, and discipline the child, the duty of providing the child with food, shelter, education, and medical care, and the right and responsibility to make decisions of financial significance concerning the child. These obligations are subject to any residual parental rights and responsibilities and rights and responsibilities of a guardian if one has been appointed. When a child is committed to the department and the department places the child with the child’s parent, the parent has the responsibility to provide and pay for food, shelter, education, and medical care for the child. When parental rights have been terminated, or there are no living parents and no guardian has been appointed, the responsibilities of legal custody include those in (b) and (c) of this section. The department or person having legal custody of the child may delegate any of the responsibilities under this section, except authority to consent to marriage, adoption, and military enlistment may not be delegated. For purposes of this chapter, a person in charge of a placement setting is an agent of the department.

       Termination of the father’s designation as an Indian custodian was appropriate because the father’s status as Indian custodian was based solely on the mother’s temporary transfer of physical care and custody to the father after termination of his parental rights. Because the mother possessed the authority to revoke the transfer at any time before the Office of Children’s Services (OCS) took custody, and because the mother and OCS acted jointly to rescind the earlier transfer, the condition under which the father met the definition of Indian custodian no longer existed.

      <p>
       Where the Department of Health and Social Services decided to allow minor children, who had been adjudicated as children in need of aid, to move from Alaska to Alabama with their foster care family, the state’s action constituted a de facto termination of a natural parent’s visitation rights; the natural father was unemployed and virtually penniless, the state would not provide airfare so that the father could visit his children on a regular basis, and the father would be limited to phone “visits” because of his lack of funds. D.H. v. State, 723 P.2d 1274 (Alaska 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Department’s decision to place children in a foster home in Anchorage did not constitute a de facto termination of their mother’s parental rights of visitation, notwithstanding the mother’s contention that she did not have the financial means to travel from her home in Juneau to Anchorage.

      <p>
       Before a limitation on reasonable parental limitation is justified, the Department of Health and Social Services must present proof that the limitation is in the child’s best interests, and where no such evidence was presented, the case for restricting visitation with the incarcerated father was not made.

      </p>
      <p>
       After terminating a father’s parental rights, a trial court did not err in refusing to reserve post-termination visitation because the father’s criminal record showed a pattern of violent behavior, especially toward women; the father had at least eight violence-related criminal convictions, including assaulting the child’s mother the night before the child was born.
       Miles L. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Oct. 20, 2010) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of a father's parental rights to the father's daughter, an Indian child who received treatment for sexualized and aggressive behavior, was appropriate because the superior court reasonably concluded that the father failed to remedy the harmful conduct or conditions, that visitation was not in the child's best interest, that the father had failed to comply with substance abuse testing and delayed a critical sex offender risk assessment, and that it would cause serious emotional damage to return the child to the father's home.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the state presented overwhelming evidence of the mother’s repeated failure to care appropriately for her children, and her decade long lack of success in substance abuse treatment for abuse of cocaine and methamphetamine, and where a psychologist testified it was unlikely the mother would ever be capable of parenting, reasonable efforts at family reunification were exhausted, and termination of the mother’s parental rights was supported by substantial evidence. Erica A. v. Dep't of Health &amp; Soc. Servs., 66 P.3d 1 (Alaska 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The parental rights of a father were properly terminated following his conviction and sentence for sexually assaulting and attempting to assault his minor children, where the length of his sentence made efforts to reunite the family unnecessary. Frank E. v. State, 77 P.3d 715 (Alaska 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       A child was a child in need of aid because the child’s father, who was incarcerated in another state and had little contact with the child for 10 years, had abandoned the child, and because the child’s mother created conditions which caused the child to need aid. The Alaska Division of Family and Youth Services had satisfied its statutory obligation to make reasonable efforts to reunify the child and the father, and it was in the child’s best interests to terminate the father’s parental rights. G.C. v. Dep't of Health &amp; Soc. Servs., Div. of Family &amp; Youth Servs., 67 P.3d 648 (Alaska 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of mother’s parental rights to her daughters was proper because adequate findings supported superior court’s conclusion that they were children in need of aid and superior court did not err in authorizing the office of children’s services to discontinue making reasonable efforts to reunify the family. Audrey H. v. State, 188 P.3d 668 (Alaska 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of the father’s parental rights was proper because he failed to remedy his conduct within a reasonable time in light of his recurring substance abuse, and his problematic treatment history; the Office of Children’s Services made reasonable efforts to provide the father with family support services, and termination of his parental rights was in his daughter’s best interests as she needed permanency. It was not in her best interests to wait for the father to make further strides toward permanent sobriety, especially in light of his resistance to treatment during all but the final months of the proceedings. Blake B. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Oct. 28, 2015) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Office of Children's Services (OCS) made reasonable efforts to reunify the family because, although the children went through nine different foster placements in the three months after OCS assumed custody, the changes in placement resulted not from OCS ineptitude but from the children's acute behavioral issues; OCS repeatedly referred both parents to rehabilitative services, including counseling, shelters, mental health and substance abuse assessments, substance abuse treatment, and parenting classes; and much of the parents' difficulty in making progress in their rehabilitative efforts was due to their missed calls, meetings, assessments, and drug tests.
       Bernadette K. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska June 21, 2017) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Office of Children’s Services (OCS) made reasonable efforts to reunify the family; the record indicated that it was not OCS’s failure but the father’s refusal to acknowledge his mental health issues that ultimately prevented the success of OCS’s reunification efforts because OCS referred the father for a psychological assessment in every case plan it developed.
       Darwin B. v. State (Alaska Jan. 4, 2017) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Office of Children’s Services (OCS) made reasonable efforts to reunify the family; in light of the father’s history of non-cooperation, OCS’s consistent reunification efforts for approximately 25 months were more than sufficient to remedy its early failure to make reasonable efforts.
       Darwin B. v. State (Alaska Jan. 4, 2017) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a termination of parental rights case, the superior court did not err in concluding that the Office of Children's Services (OCS) on the whole made reasonable efforts to reunify the mother and her children because the OCS referred the mother to and paid for her participation in psychological evaluations, domestic violence evaluations, domestic violence classes, substance abuse evaluations, therapy, and the Resource Center for Parents and Children reunification program; the OCS offered visitation to the parents after the trial home visit ended; the OCS provided the mother with food, clothing, transportation, and some assistance obtaining public housing; and the OCS continued to provide services until the end of the case. Keira H. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Dec. 13, 2017) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of the mother's parental rights was in the children's best interests because she had a more than 15-year history of opioid addiction, and she admitted that she was an addict; the Office of Children's Services had been involved with her older children; and she was unable to provide a stable home within a reasonable time.

Therefore, termination of the father's parental rights was inappropriate because the OCS's minimal engagement with the father, combined with the lack of a relevant case plan, meant that the OCS did not make reasonable efforts toward reunification.

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of a mother’s parental rights was proper where the record showed that it was not the OCS’s failures that caused the mother’s mental health and substance abuse problems to remain untreated but rather the mother’s lack of willingness to maintain contact with her caseworkers, to candidly report her health status to service providers, and to engage in services when they were offered. Amanda K. v. Dep't of Health &amp; Soc. Servs., Office of Children's Servs., — P.3d — (Alaska Nov. 2, 2011) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Office of Child Services caseworkers made reasonable efforts to maintain contact with the father, connect him with services, and facilitate the establishment of a relationship between him and his daughter. Given his exposure of the child to harm during unsupervised visits at the father’s home, requiring OCS supervised visits, and then terminating those visits due to the father’s behavior, was proper. Sherman B. v. State, 290 P.3d 421 (Alaska 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although OCS petitioned to terminate a parent’s rights soon after a child was born, there was substantial information to support a determination that reasonable efforts to facilitate the relationship were made, including supervised visitation, attempts to hold planning meetings with the father and to obtain a psychological evaluation to help determine what approaches would be helpful to improve the father’s parenting skills. The father was inconsistent regarding visitation, and failed to attend the meetings or undergo the evaluation. Sherman B. v. State, 310 P.3d 943 (Alaska 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother suggested that the Office of Children’s Service’s duty to refer a client to services required the office to make an appointment with the provider, but the reunification services requirement is met by providing information and referrals regarding the services; the office referred the mother to numerous providers, and she failed to meaningfully participate with the office’s efforts to engage her in services. Nora M. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Mar. 5, 2014) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother had abused cocaine and other substances since the age of seventeen, and had access to multiple treatment programs over the course of her life, most of which she did not complete. In several instances she did not stay in touch with her caseworker so as to be able to learn what remedial opportunities were available. There was no reason to believe this long-time pattern of behavior by the mother would change, despite the efforts of the department. Amy M. v. State, Dep't of Health &amp; Soc. Servs., 320 P.3d 253 (Alaska 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a termination of parental rights case, the trial court did not err in finding that the Office of Children’s Services made reasonable efforts to enable the child to return home to the mother but that she refused to engage consistently with the recommended mental health services; she failed to attend the sessions required in order to make comprehensive treatment recommendations; regardless of the quality of her assessments, she never entered the recommended outpatient program, and by the time of the termination trial she had not entered any inpatient program; and, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, she testified that she did not have a substance abuse problem.
       Sandy M. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska July 16, 2014) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not err in concluding that the Office of Children's Services (OCS) made reasonable efforts to reunify the mother and her children; the mother did not engage with the case plan and did not receive the benefit of the therapies OCS made available to her, plus OCS obtained a court order compelling her to complete a psychological examination, which OCS was not compelled to do, and given that the mother repeatedly refused to allow OCS to assess her needs, her claim that OCS should have provided specific services to suit those needs was without merit. Joy B. v. State, 382 P.3d 1154 (Alaska 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not clear error to find the Office of Children's Services (OCS) made timel and, reasonable reunification efforts because (1) OCS provided case plans, supervised visitation, and referrals for treatment and financial assistance, (2) the father's whereabouts were unknown for much of the case, (3) the father would not get a psychological assessment or communicate an inability to obtain a later evaluation, (4) OCS's failure to provide an evaluation and visitation lapses while the father was in prison was not fatal to finding reasonable efforts, and (5) the father's disappearance and unwillingness to participate in services where he relocated made OCS's efforts reasonable under the circumstances.

       The state provided services to address a father’s personality disorder and substance abuse, which constituted “reasonable efforts” under this section. Jake B. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Oct. 31, 2012) (memorandum decision).

       State made multiple offers of assistance to father to facilitate contact with his child, which he declined. The state’s efforts were reasonably calibrated to the interest in parenting shown by the father. Jeff A.C. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Apr. 27, 2005), op. withdrawn, — P.3d — (Alaska 2005), sub. op., 117 P.3d 697 (Alaska 2005) (memorandum decision).

      <p>
       Order terminating the mother's parental rights to her two children was affirmed as she failed to remedy the conduct or conditions that placed her children in need of aid because she was unable to cease her use of marijuana for well over a year after the first child's removal; she continued to regularly smoke marijuana when she was pregnant with the second child, even though she was informed of the risks posed by prenatal marijuana exposure; although the mother eventually became clean, she began smoking marijuana again several months after the children were returned to her care; and, after her relapse, the condition of the family's home and the hygiene of the children deteriorated. Keira H. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Dec. 13, 2017) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly terminated a mother's parental rights to her children because she failed to remedy the conduct or conditions that placed her children at substantial risk of harm, her continued custody of the children would likely result in serious emotional or physical harm to them, and termination was in the best interests of the children, where, while the mother had completed one treatment program, she had been unsuccessful in six prior attempts at other programs, and admitted that she was not ready to take the children, the foster parents were willing to adopt the children, the children's tribe had approved the foster parents as the adoptive placement, and the current placement would enhance the children's lives.
       Cyra J. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Aug. 8, 2018) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not clearly err by finding that the mother failed to remedy her conduct in a reasonable time because it was not clear that she had exhibited an ability to implement the necessary skills to safely care for her children. There was considerable evidence that the mother "shuts down" after extended periods of parenting, and her inattentiveness could result in physical injury to the children. Charles S. v. State, 442 P.3d 780 (Alaska 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not clearly err in finding that the mother failed to remedy her conduct in a reasonable time where consideration of the children's status as an Indian child was not required when making a failure-to-remedy finding, the mother admitted that she was not yet ready for the children to be returned to her care, she had continued to engage in significant domestic violence and substance abuse, and the children needed permanence and stability.
       Jean B. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Aug. 7, 2019) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of parental rights was proper as the mother had not remedied the conduct or conditions that caused her children to be in need of aid because her admitted substance abuse had left her unable to raise her children and led to her failure to protect them from her husband’s abuse; and she had done virtually nothing to address her substance abuse and mental health trauma.
       Josiah M. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Sept. 30, 2020) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court clearly erred when it found that a father had failed to remedy the conditions placing his children in need of aid because the father's release from prison remedied the condition that placed the children in need of aid; because the father 's “unavailability” was not relevant to whether the father was released from incarceration, it was error to consider it. Ted S. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Oct. 28, 2020) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a)(2) does use the specific article “the” when referring to “the conduct or conditions” that were not remedied, and that subsection's conduct and conditions language must be understood to refer back to the conduct and conditions in AS subsection (a)(1); therefore, the conditions to be remedied must be those the court found the children were subjected to and that rendered them in need of aid.

       Because the mother's substance abuse and abusive relationships continued to pose a danger to her children, the superior court did not err by finding that she failed to remedy her conduct.

      </p>
      <p>
       Court properly terminated a mother’s parental rights because the mother had not recognized the impact of substance abuse on her parenting and on her children and, correspondingly, that the safety risk persisted and had not been remedied; testimony at the first trial revealed that the mother minimized her substance abuse and denied that it affected the children. Pamiuqtuuq C. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Mar. 2, 2022).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not err when it accepted the termination petition and subsequently terminated the mother’s parental because the trial occurred about 13 months after the Office of Children’s Services (OCS) removed the child and it found that the mother had failed to participate in services before the adjudication hearing. It noted that, since the adjudication, the mother had been stopped in a truck littered with a “shocking” amount of drugs and related paraphernalia. Nera S. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Mar. 9, 2022).

        Counsel not ineffective for failing to request continuance. —

      <p>
       In a termination of parental rights case, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to request a continuance because there were several tactical reasons why counsel might have decided not to ask for a continuance, including the mother's recent drug relapse and her risk of relapsing again due to her refusal to enter residential treatment; a delay could have produced additional evidence that the children were improving in their foster placement; and a continuance of four months, even assuming the superior court granted it, would have been of little tactical use because the testimony at trial indicated that the mother needed nine months to a year before the children could safely be placed with her.

       In state’s petition to terminate mother’s parental rights, because the Alaska Constitution only preserves a jury trial for legal causes of action, not those that are equitable in nature, and child protection cases are historically treated as matters of equity in Alaska, there was no due process right to a jury trial in children in need of aid proceedings.

       Court’s refusal to continue a termination of parental rights case pending an appeal of a father’s criminal convictions for physical and sexual abuse of the children was proper; there was a statutory time limit, and the children’s interest in permanency weighed heavily against delaying the proceeding for years while the father pursued an appeal. Although the father should not have been penalized for asserting his Fifth Amendment right not to testify at the adjudication or termination proceeding, the superior court had to balance this privilege against the children’s interest in a timely resolution of the proceedings when considering the continuation request. Rowan B. v. State, 361 P.3d 910 (Alaska 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not an abuse of discretion to deny a father's motion to continue a termination of parental rights trial until the father's release from custody to demonstrate sobriety because (1) it did not appear even a short delay would let the father allay concerns that he would again relapse or other concerns, so denying a continuance did not seriously prejudice the father, and (2) the children's interest in permanency had to be considered.

       It was not an abuse of discretion to deny a father a termination trial continuance because the father showed no serious prejudice by showing the father could timely remedy conduct causing the father's child to be in need of aid, as (1) a short continuance did not provide enough time for needed services, and (2) a long continuance was not in the child's best interests.

       Termination of the mother’s parental rights was in her children’s best interests because the evidence showed her drug and alcohol abuse was likely to continue and therefore likely to endanger the children if they were in her custody. The children were living in a safe and loving preadoptive home and had been in the Office of Children’s Services’ custody for 29 months, a significant portion of their lives. Thea G. v. State, 291 P.3d 957 (Alaska 2013).

       Trial court properly terminated a mother’s parental rights to her child under the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 because termination was in the child’s best interests; the trial court properly took into account factors such as the child’s need for permanency, his bond with the the family he had lived with since his birth, and the likelihood that the mother would not be ready to provide full-time care for the child within a reasonable period of time.

      <p>
       Superior court did not clearly err in concluding that termination of a mother’s parental rights was in the children’s best interest because it gave the possibility of a guardianship appropriate consideration; the mother’s substance abuse history and the children’s needs for permanence and stability outweighed the possibility that the mother might one day resolve her substance abuse issues, such that termination was better for the children than a guardianship.

       Superior court did not clearly err in finding that termination of the mother’s rights was in the children's best interests; although the mother claimed that separating her from the children was harmful to all of them, the mother’s best interests were not aligned with those of the children, the fact that one child was not yet in a definitive adoptive home did not preclude a finding that termination was in her best interest, and the children were making significant progress in foster care and the mother had a lack of progress. Joy B. v. State, 382 P.3d 1154 (Alaska 2016).

      <p>
       Statute only provides that the court may consider any of the enumerated best interest factors, it does not create a duty for the court to do so; the fact that the court did not expressly cite these factors was not grounds for reversing the superior court's finding, plus although the superior court did not expressly mention the factors listed in the statute, it did make factual findings relevant to several of these factors, which were supported by the record.

       Termination of the father's parental rights was in the child's best interest, as there was not a reasonable likelihood of returning the child to a parent within a reasonable time based on the child's age.

       It was in the best interest of the children to terminate their mother's parental rights because the trial court was not required to first decide whether a guardianship or adopting was in the children's best interest instead; it was important for the children to be legally free from the mother, which could have only been achieved through termination.

       There was sufficient evidence for the trial court to make its best interests determination in a termination of parental rights case because the record reflected that the mother had struggled with narcotics abuse since 2009, that she acted erratically while caring for her children, she failed to take advantage of services provided, and she had neglected her children.

       It was not clear error to conclude termination of a father's parental rights was in the children's best interest because (1) a finding that it was likely the father's problematic conduct would continue and very unlikely the children could be reunited with the father within a reasonable time was supported and not clearly erroneous, and (2) the record supported findings that the children were doing well in current placements and continuing to attempt reunification would seriously delay permanency.

       Superior court did not clearly err when it found that terminating a mother's parental rights was in the best interests of the mother's children because the court found that the mother was unable to provide for the children's basic needs and that the children had special needs requiring special attention. The children were young and needed stability and a parent who was present for them as opposed to dealing with their own issues, while the children's foster home was a potentially permanent home.

      <p>
       Termination of the mother's and the father's parental rights was in the children's best interests because the evidence showed that the parents had neglected and traumatized the children; that neither parent had yet demonstrated the necessary skills to care for the children; and that the children were improving in foster care after having suffered, both physically and emotionally, in the care of their parents.

       Termination of the mother's parental rights was in the children's best interests because the children had improved in foster care; the caseworker testified that termination would be in the children's best interests; the mother's severe and untreated substance abuse continued to pose a risk of harm to her children; and, in contrast to the mother's situation, the foster parent had the ability to provide a stable, loving home with family support.

       Superior court did not clearly err in finding that terminating the mother's parental rights was in the child's best interests as the child needed permanency; it was unlikely that the mother would remedy the conduct that made him a child in need of aid; and the Office of Children's Services had identified a possible adoptive placement.

       Superior court did not err by finding that termination of the father's parental rights was in the child's best interests as its decision to focus on the child's need for stability and the evidence that the father would not be able to provide that stability for a significant amount of time was not clearly erroneous.

      <p>
       Superior court did not err in determining that the Office of Children's Services (OCS) met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that terminating a father's parental rights was in the child's best interests because OCS presented testimony from caseworkers and documented the father's criminal history, incarceration, and history of substance abuse and failed treatment; OCS did not solely rely on an expert's testimony to prove that termination was in the child's best interests.

      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not err by terminating a father's parental rights before ensuring that the child would have a permanent home because it was the termination of the father's parental rights that transformed the obligation of the Office of Children's Services to care for the child into a legal duty to find adoptive placements for her; the requirement that termination of parental rights is in a child's best interests is a state law requirement, not an Indian Child Welfare Act requirement. Alfred J. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Apr. 3, 2019) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient evidence supported termination of a father's parental rights to the father's Indian child because (1) the father's abandonment of the child and failure to remedy the father's conduct created a risk of harm to the child, (2) the father left the child in the child's mother's custody knowing the mother abused substances, and (3) termination was in the child's best interests based on the father's conduct, especially when the child was in foster care three times in the first four years of life. Steve H. v. State, 444 P.3d 109 (Alaska 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not clearly err by finding that termination of parental rights was in the children's best interests or otherwise err in its consideration of a possible guardianship because it considered the evidence and the children's specific needs and implicitly considered guardianship as an option in its termination order; the superior court wrote detailed factual findings regarding the Office of Children's Services' long history with the children.

      </p>
      <p>
       It was not clear error to find terminating a father's parental rights was in his Indian children's best interests because his history of crime and incarceration, his time left to serve, the time required after release to show parental fitness, and his lack of a strong bond with the children showed the children could not return to him within a reasonable time; he had over three years left to serve, he needed at least a year after release to show sobriety, stability, and parenting skills, and he was unlikely to change his behavior, as he did not accept responsibility for his conduct

      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not clearly err in citing the “the totality of the circumstances” in its determination that terminating a father's parental rights was in the children's best interests because it did consider specific, statutorily enumerated factors; it explained that, given the multiple prior family interventions by state agencies and the father's minimal engagement with his case plan, there was a high likelihood his harmful conduct would continue if the children were returned to him.

      <p>
       Superior court did not err in finding that it was in the son's best interests that the father's parental rights be terminated because, emphasizing the enormous amount of energy and attentiveness it took to care for the child due to his special needs, the superior court predicted that the child would likely sustain serious emotional or physical damage if placed in the father's care.

       The superior did not clearly err in finding that termination of the father's parental rights was in the child's best interest where it gave great weight to two factors: the amount of effort the father had expended to remedy the conduct that brought the child into the custody of the Office of Children's Services and the history of his similar conduct.

       Termination of a mother’s parental rights was appropriate due to the child’s need for permanency, the strong bond which the child had formed with a foster family, and — given that the child’s older sister was part of the foster family already — the importance of keeping siblings together. The court also noted the foster family’s willingness to support a continued relationship between the child and the mother. Rihanna N. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Dec. 8, 2021).

       Record supported trial court’s finding that termination of the father’s parental rights was in the best interests of the child where the record showed that the child suffered emotional problems as the result of the instability of his home environment; child had spent the last 19 months in foster care, he could not afford to wait any longer for his father to be a parent, and he would suffer severe psychological harm if the father was granted custody and then dropped out of his life again, which was likely.

       Father had ongoing problems with addiction to prescription and illicit drugs, and while he may have been devoted to his daughter and may have believed he had a bond with her, ample evidence supported the trial court’s best-interest determination to terminate father’s parental rights.

       The court is not specifically obligated to enter findings articulating its consideration of a parent’s desire to continue parenting his children as a component of its best interests analysis. The factors outlined in this section are nonexclusive, and there is no requirement that superior courts “accord a particular weight to any given factor.” All of the statutory factors indicated that the termination of the father’s parental rights was in the best interests of his children.

       In a termination of parental rights case, because a continuance of a few months would not have addressed the court’s concerns regarding the likelihood that the mother would relapse, the denial of the continuance did not seriously prejudice the mother’s ability to make her case at trial. In light of the mother’s pattern of relapse following treatment, the superior court had a strong basis to conclude that a few months of additional time would not have been sufficient for the mother to show that she had truly remedied her conduct.

       Young children have unique needs for permanency and bonding. At the time of termination, the child was only eight months old. He had spent his entire life in his grandmother’s care and had developed a strong bond with his grandmother and his older sister. It was in his best interests to remain with the grandmother, and the best interests of the child, not the parent, are paramount.

       Where the father abandoned his son for three years and lost contact with all those involved in his son’s Child in Need of Aid (CINA) proceeding, this abandonment finding justified termination without visitation notwithstanding any of the father’s arguments regarding the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), because his alleged learning disability had no bearing on the abandonment issue and he did not argue that the state’s efforts in contacting him were unreasonable under the ADA.

       A child was a child in need of aid because the child’s father, who was incarcerated in another state and had little contact with the child for 10 years, had abandoned the child, and because the child’s mother created conditions which caused the child to need aid. The Alaska Division of Family and Youth Services had satisfied its statutory obligation to make reasonable efforts to reunify the child and the father, and it was in the child’s best interests to terminate the father’s parental rights.

      <p>
       Superior court properly terminated a father’s parental rights because the father abandoned his children by failing to participate in visitation; the requirement of the Office of Children’s Services that the father visit with the children individually was reasonable, and his failure to request individual visitation evidenced a willful disregard for parental obligations. Further, the father’s participation in the case plan was no more than minimal, because although he took some preliminary steps toward completing his case plan, he failed to adequately address his ongoing mental health issues or to undertake any parenting counseling.

       Termination of a father’s parental rights to a child on the ground of abandonment was appropriate because the father, who was incarcerated, had not remedied the abandonment within a reasonable time. The limitations imposed by the father’s incarceration were largely due to the father’s own conduct, the father’s recent change in attitude toward parenting the child did not outweigh a history of disinterest, and the child’s best interests were served by termination.

       Although the superior court clearly erred when it found that a father had failed to remedy the conditions placing his children in need of aid, since its findings concerning “unavailability” were irrelevant to whether the father was released from incarceration, because “unavailability” could be relevant to abandonment, the matter was remanded to the superior court to reconsider its findings in relation to Office of Children's Services' abandonment argument and petition.

      <p>
       Termination of the mother's and the father's parental rights was proper as the mother failed to remedy the conduct and conditions that caused the children to be children in need of aid because the parents' history showed a repeated pattern of substance abuse, incarceration, and domestic violence; the mother did not understand the extent of the children's needs or have the skills necessary to protect them from future harm; the mother never internalized or understood the ways in which her behavior adversely affected the children; and, by the time of trial, the mother still had not completed substance abuse treatment or a long period of sobriety.

       Termination of parental rights to a child was appropriate because, although the father argued that he cleaned up the family home, obtained a commercial driver's license and a job, and passed drug tests during the pendency of the case, the superior court did not clearly err in finding that he did not remedy his mental health issues that were the root cause of his inability to safely parent the child and placed the child in substantial risk of continued physical harm and continuing mental injury.

       Finding that a mother had not remedied the conduct or conditions that endangered her son was not clear error where her behavior showed that she did not recognize the risk of harm that her domestic partner posed to the child's mental and physical well-being.

       Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper based on her failure to remedy her substance abuse within a reasonable time because the mother frequently submitted positive urinalyses (UA) samples or failed to report for UAs at all; her substance abuse continued throughout the case; and the children would be at risk of harm if returned to the mother's or the grandmother's care.

       Trial court properly terminated a mother’s parental rights to her child under the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 because, based on the mother’s untreated substance abuse and underlying emotional issues, as well as the child’s option for permanency with the family he had lived with since birth, the trial court did not err in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that allowing the mother’s custody of the child likely would result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.

       Termination of a father’s parental rights was upheld where there was clear and convincing evidence that the children were in need of aid because they were at risk of further sexual abuse if returned to the father since he failed to address allegations that one of the children had been molested by a grandfather; moreover, the father had not remedied his conduct or the conditions at home because he did not develop an understanding of the importance of protecting his daughter or the risk due to the grandfather’s presence. The family had been provided with services designed to enable the safe return of the children, but termination was in the best interest of the children. Justin C. v. State, Dep't of Health &amp; Soc.

       Trial court, which terminated a mother’s parental rights under the Indian Child Welfare Act and the children in need of aid statutes, did not err in finding that the evidence presented proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the mother’s children would likely be seriously harmed if returned to the mother. Because the aggregated testimony of expert and lay witnesses supported the trial court’s finding that the mother likely would continue to relapse until she resolved her underlying mental health issues, the trial court’s conduct-not-likely-to-change finding was not clearly erroneous.

       Court properly found a child to be in need of aid and terminated a father’s parental rights where the State made reasonable efforts to assist the father where it drew up a suitable case plan, including parenting classes and drug monitoring. The State also made reasonable efforts to provide the father with visitation until it became clear that the visitation was harmful to the child. Martin N. v. State, 79 P.3d 50 (Alaska 2003).

       Court properly terminated an incarcerated father’s parental rights where the State arranged visitation between the father and his children during the new incarceration until the superior court ordered otherwise; although father received substance abuse treatment and parenting classes from the department of corrections, the court determined he was unlikely to recover sufficiently to successfully care for his children. Stanley B. v. State, 93 P.3d 403 (Alaska 2004).

      <p>
       In a parental rights termination case, the state made reasonable efforts to reunite the father and the child where the state notified him in writing of the permanency hearing, the social worker returned his calls, gave him information regarding the child and the foster parents, mailed him documents relating to the child, offered him the opportunity to speak with the foster mother and participate in an administrative review hearing (which he declined), and set up a case plan.Jeff A.C. v. State, 117 P.3d 697 (Alaska 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by finding that mother failed to remedy her conduct within a reasonable time because even though she had been in compliance with case plan since November 2007, at the time of trial she still faced significant obstacles to successful reunification such as the sons’ lack of attachment to their mother, her inability to show empathy for what her sons had experienced, and the likelihood that she would act aggressively when under stress and abuse or neglect her sons.

       Office of Children’s Services (OCS) made reasonable efforts to provide family support services where it provided: (1) in-person reviews of the requirements of the case plan; (2) referrals for substance abuse assessments and substance abuse treatment; (3) drug testing; (4) parenting classes; (5) domestic violence education; and (6) consistent visitation, beginning immediately after the first child was taken into emergency custody. As to the father, the court held that given his incarceration, the OCS’s efforts to provide the father with family support services when he was not in prison, and the father’s failure to make any changes necessary to achieve reunification, the trial court did not clearly err in finding that the OCS’s reunification efforts in their entirety were reasonable despite its failure to provide visitation in prison.

       Termination of a mother’s parental rights was proper where the record showed that it was not the OCS’s failures that caused the mother’s mental health and substance abuse problems to remain untreated but rather the mother’s lack of willingness to maintain contact with her caseworkers, to candidly report her health status to service providers, and to engage in services when they were offered.

The mother failed to tell the OCS about transportation difficulties, did not use cab vouchers, and was able, at times, to use other sources for help.

       Alaska Office of Children's Services (OCS) made reasonable reunification efforts given a father's incarceration.

       Termination of the father's parental rights was proper because the Office of Children's Services (OCS) satisfied the requirement that it make reasonable efforts to reunify the family as the initial communication failure in 2012 and the alleged lack of encouragement during the trial home visit involved, at most, discrete and limited failures in OCS's very long-running involvement with the family; and there was conflicting evidence regarding OCS's reasonable efforts as, from the trial court's perspective, the father's willingness to engage with his younger children's OCS case showed not that OCS failed to work as hard in the current case, but rather that the father did not care enough about his older children to make the same effort.

       Termination of parental rights of mother to her tenth child was proper where she had lost rights to her nine other children due to her ongoing addiction to crack cocaine, and her related conduct which put the children at risk, and which continued after the birth of this child despite repeated offers to the mother of help and treatment. Under the circumstances termination in little over a year after the child was put into foster care did not violate the mother’s right to reasonable efforts supporting the family.

       In a case terminating the mother's and the father's parental rights in the Families with Infants and Toddlers Court (FIT Court), the supreme court concluded that it was error to adhere to the FIT Court's preset timeline rather than making an individualized assessment of whether the parents had a reasonable time to remedy the conduct or conditions in the home that placed the children in substantial risk based on the facts of their children's cases because the court acknowledged that a few more months might have made a difference for the mother. To the extent the 12-months-to-permanency timeline was interpreted as lacking the flexibility to account for individual circumstances, it contravened the statutory command of this statute. Edna L. v.

       Superior court’s conclusion that best interests of the children would be served by terminating father’s parental rights was not clearly erroneous and was warranted by this section because the children continued to be in need of aid, father failed to complete anger management and parenting classes, and father had not remedied conditions that placed his children at risk of substantial harm, including sudden and long absences between visits and unrealistic beliefs of his children’s behavioral and emotional problems.

       Trial court did not err by finding that the mother failed to remedy the conduct or conditions that led to removal of her children where she (1) did not adequately address her mental health problems and failed to engage in consistent treatment; (2) failed to fully integrate what she learned about domestic violence and the trial court questioned whether she had permanently ended her relationship with the father; and (3) failed to address her substance abuse, as she failed to regularly attend 12-step meetings, maintain regular conduct with a sponsor, or surround herself with individuals leading a lifestyle conductive to sobriety. She continued to minimize and even deny her drug use and abuse in her testimony. Barbara P. v. State, 234 P.3d 1245 (Alaska 2010).

       Sufficient evidence supported termination of father’s parental rights where, although he attended a program on family violence intervention, he otherwise failed to comply with requirements set by the court, and continued to exhibit behavior which was potentially harmful to the child or others, including threatening a social worker, and failure to accept responsibility for his own actions.

       Trial court did not err in finding that termination of a mother’s parental rights was in her child’s best interest because it considered the mother’s long and cyclical history of engaging in treatment and then relapsing, her failure to follow through with mental health treatment and medication compliance, her failure to comply with her case plan, and her failure to separate herself from her abusive boyfriend.

       Court properly terminated a father’s parental rights on the basis of abandonment because the father voluntarily left Alaska, and made no attempt to see his son for more than a year, even though he knew that social services was working to help reunite him with the child. A social worker offered to help the father have the no-contact order in his criminal case modified to allow supervised visits with the child even while the criminal case was pending, but the father did not follow up on her offer.

       Termination of a father's parental rights to the father's daughter, who received treatment for sexualized and aggressive behavior, was appropriate because the superior court reasonably concluded that the father failed to remedy the harmful conduct or conditions, that visitation was not in the child's best interest, that the father had failed to comply with substance abuse testing and delayed a critical sex offender risk assessment, and that it would cause serious emotional damage to return the child to the father's home.

       There was sufficient support in the record to find that a mother failed to provide adequate medical attention and other care and control necessary for her children's physical and mental health, and thus, the superior court did not clearly err when it found the children in need of aid due to neglect; the mother failed to provide her son proper medical attention when she declined to take him to therapy, and the neglect of the daughter played a strong role in her continuing mental health issues.

       Termination of parental rights was appropriate because the trial court did not clearly err by finding that a father was not meaningfully engaging in a case plan, by declining to credit the testimony of the father's witnesses over the testimony of the witnesses for the children's services agency, in finding active but unsuccessful efforts were made to prevent the breakup of the Indian family, and in giving more weight to expert witness testimony than to testimony from the father's witnesses as to the likelihood of future harm to the child.

       Termination of mother’s parental rights was supported by evidence that the child was a child in need of aid due to mother’s substance abuse. The mother did not remedy her substance abuse issues in a reasonable time, and there was no evidence the mother would change her behavior upon release from incarceration; once released it would take two years for her prove sobriety and stability.

       Because a mother in a termination of parental rights case did not contest the superior court's finding that the mother's children were in need of aid based on the mother's substance abuse, the appellate court declined to consider the alternative findings that the children were in need of aid based on abandonment and risk of exposure to domestic violence by the mother's paramour, as those issues were rendered moot.

      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not err by finding clear and convincing evidence that the child was at substantial risk of harm due to the father's substance abuse because he admitted to smoking drugs while the child was in the house, he testified that others he associated with had used drugs in his home and he blamed the child's positive drug test on them, and the child's hair follicle tested positive for amphetamine, cocaine, and methamphetamine while she was in the father's care and control.

      <p>
       Because this statute did not require the Office of Children's Services to wait 15 months before filing a petition, the court did not err by holding a termination trial based on a petition filed less than 15 months after the children were removed from their home as the mother had made no progress in addressing her substance abuse and was not willing to accept accountability; and the father refused to take any accountability for his behaviors and had not been open to working on the conditions causing his children to be in need of aid.

       Superior court did not clearly err in finding that a mother had failed to remedy the conduct that caused her child to be in need of aid, having balanced the mother’s efforts to address her substance abuse with her unsuccessful attempts to maintain sobriety. In finding that termination was in the child’s best interests, the superior court took into account factors including the child’s need for permanency and the low likelihood of return to the mother’s care within the foreseeable future.

       Trial court did not err in terminating Indian parents’ rights on the basis of neglect because the evidence established that the children were in need of aid based in part on conditions created by the parents that had subjected the children to neglect, including evidence that the father used drugs and the parents permitted others to use drugs in their home, that the children missed almost 80 days of school in one academic year because the parents overslept, that the parents missed visits with the children after the children were taken into state custody, and that the children suffered from significant delays in speech and verbal skills and required dental care when they entered state custody.

       Where a child was properly found to be in need of aid due to her father’s abandonment, the record also established that the father had failed to remedy harmful conduct or conditions where he had failed to undergo required substance abuse assessment and treatment, which was needed before he could resume visitation with the child, and there was a strong bond between the child and her foster family.

       Because the children required permanence and stability that the father could not offer, and because the evidence suggested that he would not be able to provide permanence and stability within any reasonable time period, terminating the father’s parental rights was proper.

      <p>
       Denial of a mother’s request for a review hearing to rescind the termination of her parental rights was appropriate under subsection (h) because the mother repeatedly tested positive for cocaine and opiates, failed to complete rehabilitation programs, and failed to overcome her substance abuse problem despite a few recent short-term positive steps.

      <p>
       It was reasonable for the superior court to conclude that the failure of the adoptive placement did not entitle a mother to be permitted to withdraw her relinquishment based solely on a best interests determination because the relinquishment expressly acknowledged that the adoption could fail as a result of a negative home study or the grandmother's inability to care for the child; the relinquishment was unconditional, and only retained a privilege to be notified if the adoption fell through.

       Even assuming the superior court had the discretion to accept a mother's late notice to withdraw a voluntary relinquishment of parental rights, its refusal to do so was not an abuse of discretion because its findings comported with the statute and the relinquishment's language.

        Reinstatement of parental rights.
       </b>
       —
       Because the disputed factual findings supporting the best interests determination were not material or not clearly erroneous, the decision granting a mother reinstatement of her parental rights had to be affirmed; the superior court made findings about the child's age, his attachment to caregivers, his opportunities to maintain visitation with those to whom he was bonded, the safety, security, and stability of the mother's home, and the necessity of moving the child from his placement.
       State v. Dara S., 458 P.3d 90 (Alaska 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly reinstated a mother's parental rights because it was not clearly erroneous to find that the mother and her sister were similarly situated with respect to their bonds with the child, who had lived with the sister; over two years passed between the initial reinstatement order and the superior court's supplemental findings, and the superior court most heavily weighed the child's emotional well-being, namely his ability to maintain all familial bonds. State v. Dara S., 458 P.3d 90 (Alaska 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly reinstated a mother's parental rights because there was some support in the record for its finding that the child wanted to live with the mother; the superior court was entitled to, and did, discount the credibility of both a clinical psychologist and the caseworker. State v. Dara S., 458 P.3d 90 (Alaska 2020).

       Supreme court did not consider a mother's argument that termination of her parental rights was not in the child's best interests because by filing the relinquishment the mother voluntarily removed herself from child in need of aid proceedings relating to the child; unless and until the mother was able to resume participation in the proceedings by withdrawing or voiding her relinquishment, she had no standing to bring such a challenge.

The residency may be extended for an additional period of 45 days with the written consent of the person or agency having custody of the minor. A minor may not maintain residency beyond the 90th day following admission to a licensed program for runaway minors without the written consent of the person or agency having custody of the minor and the written consent of the department.

       Evidence supported the superior court's findings that Alaska Office of Children's Services offered the parents and the children a number of services designed to reunite them as a family, but the father was ultimately unable or unwilling to significantly shift the beliefs that stood in the way of the father's effective parenting. While the office’s efforts were not perfect, the efforts were nonetheless timely and reasonable, and quite extensive as to both the parents and the children.

       Mother did not remedy her personality disorder or drug problem within a reasonable time as provided in
       AS 47.10.088(a)(1)(B) and this section; the record contained ample evidence that the mother had a mental health disorder that impaired her judgment and capacity to parent her children adequately, particularly where two of the three children had challenging physical and developmental problems, and the third had not bonded with her.
       Natalie D. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Feb. 22, 2006) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of parental rights of mother to her tenth child was proper where she had lost rights to her nine other children due to her ongoing addiction to crack cocaine, and her related conduct which put the children at risk, and which continued after the birth of this child despite repeated offers to the mother of help and treatment. Under the circumstances termination in little over a year after the child was put into foster care did not violate the mother’s right to reasonable efforts supporting the family. Patience P. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Apr. 11, 2012) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother had abused cocaine and other substances since the age of seventeen, and had access to multiple treatment programs over the course of her life, most of which she did not complete. In several instances she did not stay in touch with her caseworker so as to be able to learn what remedial opportunities were available. There was no reason to believe this long-time pattern of behavior by the mother would change, despite the efforts of the department. The child that was the subject of this case had tested positive for cocaine at birth and had lived with his grandmother all eight months of his life. Given the past behavior of the mother, and the child’s lack of bonding with his mother, eight months did constitute a reasonable time to provide support survices, and a reasonable age at which to terminate the mother’s rights. Amy M. v. State, Dep't of Health &amp; Soc. Servs., 320 P.3d 253 (Alaska 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother was given a reasonable amount of time in which to remedy the mother's conduct leading to the mother's child's removal because the mother (1) said the mother had not engaged in therapy required to regain custody and did not desire to, and (2) the mother showed the same pattern of starting and stopping treatment in a prior case.
       Emma D. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska June 15, 2016) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of a mother's parental rights was appropriate because the mother failed, within a reasonable time, to remedy the substance abuse and mental health issues that placed the children at risk. The Alaska Office of Children's Services (OCS) worked with the mother for nearly two years, and by the time of the termination trial one child was 27 months old and had been in the custody of the OCS for 23 months, while the other child was three years old and had been in the custody of the OCS for nearly a year.
       Bonnie M. v. State, Dep't of Health &amp; Soc. Servs., — P.3d — (Alaska June 7, 2017) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the strong evidence of the son's extraordinary special needs, in particular his need for stable and consistent attention, the superior court could reasonably conclude that seven months was enough time for the father to demonstrate a sincere commitment to learning how to care for his child, and it did not err in finding that the father failed within a reasonable time to remedy the conduct or conditions that made his son a child in need of aid.

        The Department of Health and Social Services does not possess the authority to institutionalize any minor,
       </b>
       including one who has been declared a child in need of supervision [see now child in need of aid], who has been committed to its custody.
       It is unreasonable to construe Alaska children’s statutes in a manner which would result in the grant to the Department of Health and Social Services of broader powers of commitment than possessed by the trial court. In re E.M.D., 490 P.2d 658 (Alaska 1971).

       , the legislature allocated the risk of repeat offenders to the public in exchange presumably for offsetting gains realized by rehabilitating juveniles to make them productive citizens, and imposing state tort liability for harm caused by released juveniles would have distorted this balance; likewise the policy of preventing future harm was not obviously going to be served by imposing a duty, given that AS

       While the defendant's right to appear at a criminal proceeding is partially grounded in due process, the statute does not create an obligation on the Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) in particular to pay whatever is necessary to guarantee that right; the purposes of the statute are broad aspirations for the juvenile justice system as a whole, which includes not only DJJ but also the Department of Public Safety, the Court System, and the Public Defender Agency.

       Court of appeals erred in upholding a decision requiring the Public Defender Agency to pay the travel expenses for a juvenile to the site of his juvenile delinquency proceeding because neither the Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) nor the Agency was legally obligated to pay such costs; neither the DJJ's nor the Agency's authorizing statutes required them to pay the travel expenses for out-of-custody indigent juvenile defendants to attend their delinquency proceedings.

       Although multiple factors weighed in favor of granting the joint motion for an in-person trial in this juvenile delinquency case, the judge's denial was not an abuse of discretion; he had to balance the public health concerns created by the COVID-19 pandemic against the rights of the parties. When the initial request was made, the municipality still had a 15-person limit to in-person gatherings, and even after that limit was extended to 35 people, the case numbers in Anchorage continued to be high.

        Due process right to protect juvenile offender status.

       — Superior court erred in granting the State's waiver petition because defendant juvenile had a due process right to present evidence at the waiver hearing to protect his juvenile offender status and avoid being waived to adult court; minors alleged to have violated Alaska's criminal laws, including those for whom the State is seeking to waive juvenile jurisdiction, have a liberty interest in juvenile status.

       Statute requiring a minor who was accused of a non-felony traffic offense to be charged, prosecuted, and sentenced in the district court in the same manner as an adult, but not applying that provision when the minor was accused of committing a felony violation, did not violate the equal protection provision because classifying minor offenders according to whether they were charged with a felony or misdemeanor violation was closely related to the State's competing interests of deterrence and rehabilitation as it promoted the State's interest in a uniform system of penalties to deter bad driving and protect the public, but the legislature could have concluded that the legal consequences of a felony conviction were too severe for a minor.

       Enactment of the provision changing criminal penalties faced by 16- and 17-year-olds for certain criminal acts did not violate Alaska Const., art.

       Combination of the automatic waiver statute and the adult sentencing statute was consistent with evolving standards of decency and this scheme bore a fair and substantial relationship to the legitimate purposes of punishment; the sentencing judge gave the minor defendant’s rehabilitative prospects careful scrutiny and appropriate weight and the resulting sentence for first-degree murder was not clearly mistaken.

       Before a juvenile can be determined delinquent in a proceeding which could result in commitment to an institution, thus curtailing his freedom, certain requisites must be met. First, written notice of the charges must be given to the juvenile and his parents sufficiently in advance of the proceedings to allow preparation to meet the charges.
       Second, the child and his parents must be apprised of the right to counsel, including appointed counsel in case of indigency. Third, the child may exercise his privilege against self-incrimination. Lastly, absent a valid confession, the determination of delinquency cannot be sustained in the absence of sworn testimony, which is subject to cross-examination. E. J. v.

The court shall appoint counsel in such cases unless it makes a finding on the record that the minor has made a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel and a parent or guardian with whom the minor resides or resided before the filing of the petition concurs with the waiver. In cases in which it has been alleged that the minor has committed an act that would be a felony if committed by an adult, waiver of counsel may not be accepted unless the court is satisfied that the minor has consulted with an attorney before the waiver of counsel.

         Findings necessary to justify waiver. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        To justify waiver, the children’s court judge must find, on sufficient evidence, that probable cause is established at the hearing for believing that the child committed the act with which he was charged in the petition and which if committed by an adult would constitute a crime and the child is not amenable to the treatment provided under this article. P.H. v. State, 504 P.2d 837 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a prerequisite to criminal prosecution, the children’s court must find not only that the child is properly accused but also that he would not be receptive to the rehabilitative programs available to the court. P.H. v. State, 504 P.2d 837 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The inability to predicate a plan for a defendant during the short time remaining before his 19th birthday coupled with the obvious need of treatment as disclosed by the record may be sufficient to justify a waiver to adult jurisdiction. P.H. v. State, 504 P.2d 837 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court may close out the case as a juvenile matter only upon finding cause to believe that the minor is delinquent and that the minor is not amenable to treatment. B.A.M. v. State, 528 P.2d 437 (Alaska 1974).

       <p>
        A court must find that there is probable cause to believe that the minor is delinquent and that the minor is not amenable to treatment before jurisdiction may be waived. In re J. H. B., 578 P.2d 146 (Alaska 1978).

        In order to give effect of the legislature’s intent that a court may consider treatment until age 20 in determining waiver of juvenile jurisdiction, it is necessary that the judge be able to evaluate at the time of the waiver hearing whether the juvenile will in fact be available for treatment.

        The portion of the opinion in In re F.S., 586 P.2d 607 (Alaska 1978), that held that a minor in a waiver hearing could not give a binding advance consent to treatment beyond age 19 was mistaken. State v. F.L.A., 608 P.2d 12 (Alaska 1980).

         Factors to be considered in determining amenability. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Former AS 47.10.060(d) of this section suggests four factors which may be considered by the court when inquiring into the amenability issue: (1) the seriousness of the offense; (2) the delinquency of the minor; (3) the probable cause of the delinquent behavior; and (4) the facilities available for the treating of the minor. J. W. H. v. State, 583 P.2d 227 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         All four factors listed in former AS 47.10.060(d) need not be resolved against the child to justify waiver.

        Nor is there value in requiring the children’s court to make an arithmetic calculation as to the weight to be given each factor. P.H. v. State, 504 P.2d 837 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         But there must be a thorough examination of the child, his background and alternative strategies of rehabilitation
        </b>
        short of adult criminal treatment. Lacking such an examination, the children’s court has no evidentiary basis for the decision. P.H. v. State, 504 P.2d 837 (Alaska 1972); In re D. H. v. State, 561 P.2d 294 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Though the standards for determining amenability to treatment through the children’s court lack explicit definition, it is clear from the statute that the court in most cases must go beyond the circumstances surrounding the alleged delinquent acts and the age of the child. P.H. v. State, 504 P.2d 837 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though the children’s court may have independent knowledge concerning children’s treatment programs and facilities, it is necessary to make the existence and evaluation of such programs a part of the waiver proceedings to enable proper review by the supreme court. P.H. v. State, 504 P.2d 837 (Alaska 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        At a waiver hearing there must be a thorough examination of (1) the probable cause for believing that the child committed the act with which he was charged and (2) the amenability of the child to juvenile treatment. R.J.C. v. State, 520 P.2d 806 (Alaska 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of such an examination there is no evidentiary basis for a waiver decision. R.J.C. v. State, 520 P.2d 806 (Alaska 1974); J. W. H. v. State, 583 P.2d 227 (Alaska 1978).

        A waiver of juvenile jurisdiction decision can be made without the testimony of a psychologist or psychiatrist, since such testimony is germane to at most two of the four factors set out in former AS 47.10.060(d), and not all four of those facts need be determined adversely to the youth to warrant waiver of juvenile jurisdiction.

         Exclusionary rule. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Fundamental fairness requires adopting an exclusionary rule when a minor bears the burden of rebutting the statutory presumption of not being amenable to treatment in the juvenile justice system: the minor's testimonial evidence at the waiver hearing cannot be used as substantive evidence over the minor's objection at any subsequent juvenile adjudication or adult criminal proceedings. C.D. v. State, 458 P.3d 81 (Alaska 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exclusionary rule is necessary as a matter of fundamental fairness to balance a minor's right to present a defense at a waiver proceeding against the privilege against self-incrimination; by requiring a minor to choose between presenting relevant, testimonial, amenability-to-treatment evidence or preserving the privilege against self-incrimination, subsection (c)(2) forces a minor into an unfair dilemma. C.D. v. State, 458 P.3d 81 (Alaska 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        For cases in which subsection (c)(2) applies, it is necessary to exercise the exclusionary rule to prevent the State, from using a minor's juvenile waiver hearing testimony, and the fruits of that testimony, over the juvenile’s objection, at a subsequent criminal trial or adjudicatory proceeding in juvenile court; juveniles in such hearings must be advised in advance that testimony may not be admitted against them at a subsequent trial on the underlying offense.
        C.D. v. State, 458 P.3d 81 (Alaska 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exclusionary rule will mitigate much of a minor's risk in exercising the due process right to present a defense at a waiver hearing, and it is consistent with the policy underlying juvenile waiver hearings; by increasing the likelihood that a minor will be able to offer relevant evidence of amenability to treatment, this exclusionary rule will enable superior courts to make better decisions in waiver proceedings.

        Children are constitutionally entitled to jury trial in the adjudicative stage of a delinquency proceeding.
       </b>
       However, due to the uniqueness of some facets of the procedures governing children’s court proceedings and the potential damage which may accrue to the child by a public trial, the child should first consult with his counsel and his parents or guardian when appropriate, and then affirmatively assert the right to a trial by jury before it is finally granted. RLR v. State, 487 P.2d 27 (Alaska 1971). But see McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1971), in which it was held that trial by jury in the juvenile court’s adjudicative stage is not a constitutional requirement (decided prior to 1972 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever a child in a delinquency proceeding is charged with acts which would be a crime, subject to incarceration if committed by an adult, Alaska Const., art. I, § 11, guarantees him the right to jury trial. To the extent In re White, 445 P.2d 813 (Alaska 1968) [subsequently overruled, In re G.K., 497 P.2d 914 (Alaska 1972)] is inconsistent with this opinion, it is overruled. RLR v.

       The purposes of the right to jury trial, such as protection against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge, apply as much in children’s cases as in adults’ cases. RLR v. State, 487 P.2d 27 (Alaska 1971) (decided prior to 1972 amendment).

       The Hammonds test of waiver [Hammonds v. State, 442 P.2d 39 (Alaska 1968)], applies to infants as well as adults.
       The consequences of application will differ for infants, because some decisions can be “knowingly and intelligently” made only by persons of fuller knowledge and maturity.
       An infant not advised by an attorney could make few knowledgeable and intelligent decisions about whether to waive rights in judicial proceedings.
       On the other hand, in areas where an adult ordinarily delegates to his attorney decision-making authority, as in deciding whether to object to introduction of evidence, the competence of the attorney rather than of the client generally determines whether waivers satisfy the Hammonds criteria.

       Alaska’s pertinent statutory provisions and procedural rules distinguish between categories of children for purposes of administering Alaska children’s laws.

        Institutionalization of a minor. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A minor’s history of failed placements and continued violations of law can provide an adequate basis for the superior court’s decision to institutionalize the minor. However, this decision must still be made after careful consideration of the alternatives. J.T.S. v. State, 825 P.2d 461 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not error to institutionalize a minor where the minor had a long history of unsuccessful less restrictive placements and had a continuing need for treatment. The record also supported the court’s findings that the minor needed education and substance abuse treatment and would not receive them in a less restrictive environment. A.I. v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Apr. 29, 2015) (memorandum decision).

        Least restrictive alternative approach. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Under the ‘‘least restrictive alternative’’ approach, the court must consider and reject less restrictive alter- natives prior to the imposition of more restrictive alternatives. The state has the burden of proving that less restrictive alternatives are inappropriate by a preponderance of the evidence.
       In re J.H., 758 P.2d 1287 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988), overruled in part, B.F.L. v. State, 233 P.3d 1118 (Alaska Ct. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       To determine the least restrictive alternative in a given case, the court must consider, among other things, the seriousness of the offense, the degree of the child’s culpability, the totality of the underlying circumstances in the case, and the child’s prior record.
       In re J.H., 758 P.2d 1287 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988), overruled in part, B.F.L. v. State, 233 P.3d 1118 (Alaska Ct. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court erred in concluding that institutionalization was the ‘‘least restrictive alternative,’’ where there was no substantial evidence to warrant a conclusion that the child’s treatment needs could not be successfully addressed by residential treatment.

       The confrontation clause requires that a defendant in a criminal case be allowed to impeach the credibility of a prosecution witness by cross-examination directed at possible bias deriving from the witness’s probationary status as juvenile delinquent although such an impeachment would conflict with a state’s asserted interest in preserving the confidentiality of juvenile adjudications of delinquency. Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (U.S. 1974), limited, Dorsey v. Parke, 872 F.2d 163 (6th Cir. Ky. 1989).

       Whatever temporary embarrassment might result to a prosecution witness or his family by disclosure of his juvenile record — if the prosecution insisted on using him to make its case — is outweighed by petitioner’s right to probe into the influence of possible bias on the testimony of a crucial identification witness.

      </p>
      <p>
       Juvenile adjudications which are stale by Alaska’s standards and directed solely at general credibility rather than bias are generally not sufficiently probative to create a genuine conflict with the defendant’s right of confrontation. Gonzales v. State, 521 P.2d 512 (Alaska), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 868, 95 S. Ct. 125, 42 L. Ed. 2d 106 (U.S. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the attempted impeachment was of general credibility by proof of prior “convictions,” the probative value of this type of evidence is considerably less than that which suggests false or distorted testimony because of bias, and the need to confront a witness with such evidence is correspondingly less. Gonzales v. State, 521 P.2d 512 (Alaska), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 868, 95 S. Ct. 125, 42 L. Ed. 2d 106 (U.S. 1974).

      <p>
       As a general rule, the trial courts could properly refuse evidence of stale convictions or juvenile adjudications where these were offered for the purpose of discrediting the witness generally rather than to show some specific potential for bias or prejudice toward the defendant.

        Privilege against self-incrimination. —

      <p>
       When a person under the age of 18 years violated former AS 47.10.010(a)(1), he could be adjudged a “delinquent minor,” one possible consequence of which adjudication was commitment to a juvenile facility until the age of 19 [now 20]. Moreover, if there was probable cause to believe the minor was delinquent and the court found that he was not amenable to treatment as a juvenile, he could be prosecuted as if he were an adult.
       Thus, there was always some danger of incarceration, or other criminal sanctions, when a child committed an act which would have been a crime if committed by an adult.
       Under such circumstances a child had a privilege against self-incrimination. E. L. L. v. State, 572 P.2d 786 (Alaska 1977).

        Binding advance consent to treatment. —

      </p>
      <p>
       In order to give effect to the legislature’s intent that a court may consider treatment until age 20 in determining waiver of juvenile jurisdiction, it is necessary that the judge be able to evaluate at the time of the waiver hearing whether the juvenile will in fact be available for treatment. It is not possible for the judge to know this unless the child can give binding consent at the time of the hearing. State v. F.L.A., 608 P.2d 12 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       A minor may bindingly consent to an additional period of supervision as provided by former AS 47.10.080(b)(1) of this section. In determining the effect to be given to such consent, the court should consider the age and maturity of the juvenile and whether he has the advice of counsel.
       To protect a minor from making a decision adverse to his own interests, a guardian ad litem may be appointed. State v. F.L.A., 608 P.2d 12 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The portion of the opinion in In re F.S., 586 P.2d 607 (Alaska 1978), that held that a minor in a waiver hearing could not give a binding advance consent to treatment beyond age 19 was mistaken. State v. F.L.A., 608 P.2d 12 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       While it is true, as indicated in In re F.S., 586 P.2d 607 (Alaska 1978), that the statute contemplates that the determination of the additional period of treatment be made after the initial hearing, such an intent does not mandate that an advance consent to treatment given by the minor may not be regarded as binding.

This relationship imposes on the state and its authorized agents or the parents, guardian, or other suitable person the responsibility of physical care and control of the minor, the determination of where and with whom the minor shall live, the right and duty to protect, train, and discipline the minor, and the duty of providing the minor with food, shelter, education, and medical care. These obligations are subject to any residual parental rights and responsibilities and rights and responsibilities of a guardian if one has been appointed. When a minor is committed to the department and the department places the minor with the minor’s parent, the parent has the responsibility to provide and pay for food, shelter, education, and medical care for the minor.

The department or person having legal custody of the minor may delegate any of the responsibilities under this section, except authority to consent to marriage, adoption, and military enlistment may not be delegated.

      <p>
       Where the Department of Health and Social Services decided to allow minor children, who had been adjudicated as children in need of aid, to move from Alaska to Alabama with their foster care family, the state’s action constituted a de facto termination of a natural parent’s visitation rights; the natural father was unemployed and virtually penniless, the state would not provide airfare so that the father could visit his children on a regular basis, and the father would be limited to phone “visits” because of his lack of funds. D.H. v. State, 723 P.2d 1274 (Alaska 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Department’s decision to place children in a foster home in Anchorage did not constitute a de facto termination of their mother’s parental rights of visitation, notwithstanding the mother’s contention that she did not have the financial means to travel from her home in Juneau to Anchorage.

An application for any of these purposes may be made by the parent, guardian, or custodian acting in behalf of the minor, or the court may, on its own motion, and after reasonable notice to interested parties and the appropriate department, take action that it considers appropriate.

       Juvenile’s argument that his restitution obligation should have terminated when the term of probation ended was rejected; this section expressly provides that a restitution order remains enforceable after the superior court’s juvenile jurisdiction expires.

Because the trial court had issued a disposition order directing the juvenile and his mother to make restitution in an amount to be determined later, the trial court retained continuing subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the dollar amount of restitution and to issue a final restitution order.

The language “in no event more than 12 hours later” in the statute is not a modification of “immediately,” but merely sets an outside time limit for parental notification.

      Section 46, ch. 99, SLA 1998 and § 40, ch. 107, SLA 1998 both amended subsection (b). To reconcile chs. 99 and 107, SLA 1998, (b)(7) and (8), as enacted by § 46, ch. 99, SLA 1998, were renumbered as (b)(2)(G) and (H). The amendments to (b)(2)(E) made by § 46, ch. 99, SLA 1998 were used instead of those made by § 40, ch. 107, SLA 1998 because, if the amendments are not interpreted as conflicting, the ch. 99 amendments included the ch. 107 amendments and, if the amendments are interpreted as conflicting, the ch. 99 amendments had a later effective date than the ch. 107 amendments.

       Minor great-grandchildren were not placed with their great-grandparents after removal from their parents’ home for neglect. The great-grandparents’ home was found to be in poor repair and unsafe, and the great-grandparents each had significant health problems.

The superior court's factual findings that the grandmother had not permanently ended her relationship with a person convicted for a crime of domestic violence created a barrier to the placement of a child in the grandmother's home were not clearly erroneous.

       The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents, and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped, or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to

     <p>
      To protect children whose health and well-being may be adversely affected through the infliction, by other than accidental means, of harm through physical injury or neglect, mental injury, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, or maltreatment, the legislature requires the reporting of these cases by practitioners of the healing arts and others to the department. It is not the intent of the legislature that persons required to report suspected child abuse or neglect under this chapter investigate the suspected child abuse or neglect before they make the required report to the department. Reports must be made when there is a reasonable cause to suspect child abuse or neglect in order to make state investigative and social services available in a wider range of cases at an earlier point in time, to make sure that investigations regarding child abuse and neglect are conducted by trained investigators, and to avoid subjecting a child to duplicative interviews about the abuse or neglect. It is the intent of the legislature that, as a result of these reports, protective services will be made available in an effort to

       Summary judgment based on qualified immunity should not have been granted to the care coordinator for a vulnerable adult residing in a facility. The evidence supported the conclusion that the coordinator did not subjectively believe her statements were true, given that the information in her report of harm was at odds with a plan of care she had put forward only a few months earlier. Also, there was deposition testimony that the coordinator threatened to “make things ugly” for the owner if the owner did not give up objections to the removal of the adult from the facility. Hill v.

       Dismissal of the husband’s action alleging that he suffered emotional distress caused by the medical center’s release of his wife to her daughter was appropriate, in part because a spouse was not entitled to automatically assume the role of a surrogate decision maker when the health department had not sought the spouse’s consent for services. Even if the husband had been acting as his wife’s agent, he would have formed a contract between the wife and the medical center that the wife could have enforced, not the husband. Clemensen v.

       Summary judgment based on qualified immunity should not have been granted to the care coordinator for a vulnerable adult residing in a facility. The evidence supported the conclusion that the coordinator did not subjectively believe her statements were true, given that the information in her report of harm was at odds with a plan of care she had put forward only a few months earlier. Also, there was deposition testimony that the coordinator threatened to “make things ugly” for the owner if the owner did not give up objections to the removal of the adult from the facility. Hill v. Giani, 296 P.3d 14 (Alaska 2013).

      If, during the continuance of an allowance, the department ascertains that a person liable for the support of the recipient of assistance is able to provide the necessary care and support of the recipient, and the person liable for the care and support of the recipient fails or refuses to support and care for the recipient, the state has a claim for the assistance against the person liable for it.
      This claim may be enforced by civil action brought in the name of the state by the attorney general against the person liable for the recovery of the amount of money, with interest, paid to the recipient, together with the costs and disbursements of the action.

       An Alaska temporary assistance program applicant is considered to have assigned to the state, through the child support services agency of the Department of Revenue, all rights to accrued and continuing child support, from all sources, that is due for the support of any individuals in the family for whom support is sought. The assignment takes effect upon a determination that the applicant’s family is eligible for cash assistance under this chapter. Except with respect to the amount of any unpaid support obligation accrued under the assignment, the assignment terminates when the family ceases to receive cash assistance under the Alaska temporary assistance program.

The child support enforcement agency shall determine whether the participant is in good faith compliance with the requirements of this subsection and shall inform the Department of Health and Social Services of its determination. The Department of Health and Social Services shall establish whether the participant has good cause for refusing to cooperate.

        Chronic alcoholism per se cannot be pled as criminal defense. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It cannot be concluded on the current state of medical knowledge, that chronic alcoholics in general suffer from such an irresistible compulsion to drink and to get drunk in public that they are utterly unable to control their performance of either or both of these acts and thus cannot be deterred at all from public intoxication. Vick v. State, 453 P.2d 342 (Alaska 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not entitled to be relieved of accountability for the offense of public drunkenness because of his habits and drinking pattern in the use of alcoholic beverages.
       To impose a sentence of imprisonment upon conviction of that offense is not the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the federal and state constitutions. Vick v. State, 453 P.2d 342 (Alaska 1969).

    <p>
     Community mental health grantees who receive funds from the Department of Health and Social Services through the Division of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities are required to report to the department and DMHDD all income they receive, including Medicaid, insurance claims, cash, and any other third-party payments. Grantees are required to disclose all funding sources, apart from the grant awarded by the department, if the income is earned by the grant project. Insurance reimbursements are encompassed in the definition of grant income. 1999 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 10.
    </p>
    <p>
     This statutory framework allows the state to provide the support needed for communities to establish community mental health centers. However, the framework also clearly envisions a system whereby community mental health centers seek funding from other sources to augment funding received from the Department of Health and Social Services through a grant. Grants from the department are not a sole source of funding for any grantee. 1999 Alas. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 10.

      The legislature has attempted to balance the individual’s constitutional right to physical liberty and the state’s interest in protecting society from persons who are dangerous to others and protecting persons who are dangerous to themselves by providing due process safeguards at all stages of commitment proceedings.

      <p>
       Where a patient believed that she had to take unprescribed illegally obtained amphetamines and Oxycontin to manage the stresses of bipolar disorder, an involuntary commitment to a psychiatric institute for a period not to exceed 30 days was reasonable. No less restrictive alternative was available. In re Joan K., 273 P.3d 594 (Alaska 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       State had the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, a respondent was gravely disabled and commitment was the least restrictive alter- native because proving an inability to function independently with support, when relevant, was part of the burden to prove no less restrictive alternative to involuntary commitment.

        Conflict with substantive law. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement of purpose found in paragraph (6) conflicts with the substantive commitment statutes, and the substantive statutes control. The legislature’s specific requirement that the state allege that a gravely disabled person’s condition will improve indicates that no such requirement exists in the case of mentally ill persons likely to harm themselves or others. If the legislature intended to require that the state allege that mentally ill persons likely to harm themselves would be improved by treatment, it could have done so — as it did for gravely disabled people. The state is not required to show a likelihood that, in the case of a mentally ill person who poses a danger to himself, treatment will improve his condition. E.P. v. Alaska Psychiatric Inst., 205 P.3d 1101 (Alaska 2009).

       There was substantial evidentiary support for the finding that there was reason to believe a patient's mental condition could be improved with treatment because a psychiatric nurse practitioner testified that the patient had already seen slight improvement.

       When the State seeks to commit a mentally ill person on a theory of grave disability, it must prove a reasonable expectation of improvement with treatment; this showing must be made by clear and convincing evidence.

       identifies three key events that must occur before an individual may be involuntarily hospitalized. First, an adult must petition a superior court for the respondent's involuntary hospitalization. Second, a judge or mental health professional must conduct a screening investigation to evaluate the allegations in the petition. Third, the court must find probable cause that the respondent is mentally ill and that this mental illness causes the respondent to be gravely disabled or to present a likelihood of serious harm to self or others. Only then may a judge issue an ex parte order for the respondent's involuntary hospitalization.

       Superior court's order authorizing the patient's involuntary evaluation, commitment, and medication for treatment of mental illness was affirmed because the patient's attorney agreed that the nurse practitioner was an expert and did not question his testimony or opinions; and the court based its decisions upon the expert's testimony that there was no less restrictive alternative to the Alaska Psychiatric Institute and that the patient was not capable at that time of giving or withholding informed consent to medication.

       Based on this section’s provision for hospitalization for a 72-hour evaluation on an emergency basis, the legislature clearly envisioned that a psychiatric emergency could continue past the initial emergency detention; the ex parte order authorizing a psychiatric patient’s detention after the initial detention was appropriately issued on an emergency basis under this section.

       Superior court erred in authorizing the involuntary hospitalization of two women for evaluation following psychiatric emergencies. One had dementia and the other had attempted suicide, and because their continued detention before being moved to the Alaska Psychiatric Institute (API) violated their state and federal due process rights where they were not transported to API for more than 14 calendar days after their initial detentions, there was no reasonable relation between the limited purpose of the evaluation orders and the extended duration of the respondents' confinements, and the State's only explanation for the length of the pre-evaluation detentions was API's lack of capacity, which was an insufficient justification.

        Right to self-representation. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Respondent in involuntary commitment proceedings has at least an implied statutory right to self-representation, although that right is not absolute. If a respondent clearly and unequivocally invokes the self-representation right, the superior court must hold a preliminary hearing and consider factors outlined in
       <i>
        McCracken v. State
       </i>
       to determine whether self-representation should be allowed, and because respondent's self-representation request was denied without adherence to the
       <i>
        McCracken
       </i>
       framework, the court concluded that the 30-day commitment order had to be vacated. In re Necessity for the Hospitalization of Arthur A., 457 P.3d 540 (Alaska 2020).

      <p>
       Classifying the minor’s commitment as initially voluntary was error under the parental admission statute as her commitment was involuntary from the start; because the Office of Children’s Services sought to continue her commitment past September 22, longer than the 30 days allowed, it was required to seek a 90-day commitment order; this triggered additional rights for the minor, including the right to a jury trial, as she asserted.

      <p>
       Because a petition for a respondent’s involuntary 30-day commitment must allege that evaluation staff has considered but has not found that there are any less restrictive alternatives available that would adequately protect the respondent or others, and because a trial court’s deliberate consideration of this issue is critical to the protection of the respondent’s liberty interests, a petitioner must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, the petition’s allegation that there are no less restrictive alternatives, and this is not a secondary concern, nor some- thing to be considered only after the court has decided that the respondent should be committed, as finding that no less restrictive alternative exists is a constitutional prerequisite to involuntary hospitalization.

      <p>
       Superior court applied the correct legal standard to the chance of improvement issue; the State was required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that there was reason to believe the patient's mental condition could be improved by the course of treatment sought.

       When the State seeks to commit a mentally ill person on a theory of grave disability, it must prove a reasonable expectation of improvement with treatment; this showing must be made by clear and convincing evidence.

       There was no less restrictive alternative to involuntary commitment, as supervision by the patient's brother was not an acceptable alternative to treatment until the patient showed a more robust response to medication and his delusions softened. In re Jacob S., 384 P.3d 758 (Alaska 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court's orders authorizing the patient's involuntary evaluation, commitment, and medication for treatment of mental illness was affirmed because the patient's attorney agreed that the nurse practitioner was an expert and did not question his testimony or opinions; and the court based its decisions upon the expert's testimony that there was no less restrictive alternative to the Alaska Psychiatric Institute and that the patient was not capable at that time of giving or withholding informed consent to medication.

       Commitment statutes do not explicitly require the court to make any finding on whether treatment could improve a condition; they merely require the initial petition to allege that there is reason to believe that the respondent's mental condition could be improved by the course of treatment sought, but this guidance is sufficient, as it provides a clear formulation of what the legislature intended.

Appellant’s continued intent to huff gas, as a result of impaired judgment and understanding, met the statutory standard. E.P. v. Alaska Psychiatric Inst., 205 P.3d 1101 (Alaska 2009).

       Where a patient was delusional and believed that she had to take unprescribed illegally obtained controlled substances to manage the stresses of bipolar disorder, she had a mental illness and was likely to cause harm to herself due to the mental illness.

       Clear and convincing evidence showed that plaintiff was mentally ill where although a doctor did not clearly differentiate the symptoms of his mental illness from those of his alcoholism, past diagnoses, prior hospitalizations, taking of anti-psychotic medication, and the doctor's diagnosis of a mood disorder supported a finding of a distinct mental illness.

       Superior court did not err in signing the 30-day involuntary commitment order because the patient was likely to cause harm to himself or others. The patient had been behaving erratically leading up to his leaving or being fired from the Veterans Administration; he acted irately at the airport with both a ticket agent and an officer, he had loaded weapons in a gun case with no visible lock; and both the officer and a psychiatrist testified that they believed the patient's behavior was threatening.

       Trial court did not err by granting the Alaska Psychiatric Institute's (API) commitment petition for the patient because its finding that she was gravely disabled was not clearly erroneous, as the physician testified that the patient did not have housing, her disorder was severe enough that she could not be expected to find housing on her own, and that she may not have been able to eat and shower regularly unless API provided her those remedies. The trial court found that her delusions of rape and bodily harm became more acute during the time she refused to take medication or participate in planning her treatment.

       Granting of a 30-day commitment order was appropriate because the individual was gravely disabled as clear and convincing evidence showed a substantial deterioration of the individual's previous ability to function independently; diagnosis of bipolar disorder, impaired judgment, bizarre behavior and speech, a high level of agitation, and hyper-verbosity, and the condition would continue if not treated. The individual lacked the ability to exist safely outside an institutional framework due to high-risk behaviors and inability to retain housing.

       Classifying the minor’s commitment as initially voluntary was error under the parental admission statute as her commitment was involuntary from the start; because the Office of Children’s Services sought to continue her commitment past September 22, longer than the 30 days allowed, it was required to seek a 90-day commitment order; this triggered additional rights for the minor, including the right to a jury trial, as she asserted.

       Mootness is a judicial doctrine that is intended to avoid needlessly deciding issues in cases in which there is no actual controversy and which would effectively result in advisory opinions.

       Appellant was properly admitted to a psychiatric facility because, although appellant’s alcohol abuse and inhaling gasoline fumes to get high originally caused appellant’s mental deficiencies, appellant was mentally ill; “huffing” damaged the frontal lobe of appellant’s brain, resulting in dementia and personality disorder. Appellant’s continued intent to huff gas, as a result of impaired judgment and understanding, met the standards of this section. E.P. v. Alaska Psychiatric Inst., 205 P.3d 1101 (Alaska 2009).

       Commitment statutes do not explicitly require the court to make any finding on whether treatment could improve a condition; they merely require the initial petition to allege that there is reason to believe that the respondent's mental condition could be improved by the course of treatment sought, but this guidance is sufficient, as it provides a clear formulation of what the legislature intended. In re Necessity for the Hospitalization of Darren M., 426 P.3d 1021 (Alaska 2018).

       There was substantial evidence for the finding that there was reason to believe a patient's mental condition could be improved with treatment where a psychiatric nurse practitioner testified that the patient had already seen slight improvement.

        Basis for involuntary commitment. —

       Involuntary commitment order was appropriate as the court based the decision on patient's condition at the time of the hearing and considered the patient's recent symptoms and behavior. Relying on the testimony of a psychiatrist, an advanced nurse practitioner, and a social worker the court found that the patient posed a substantial risk of harm to others—based on patient's perceived intent to discontinue medication upon discharge and history of violence when patient decompensated—and that no less restrictive and feasible alternative existed.

       Officers were entitled to qualified immunity under this section as to the arrestee’s tort claims because the troopers were attempting to detain and transport the arrestee pursuant to an involuntary commitment order and their conduct was objectively reasonable. The fact that their car did not show any evidence of gunshot damage and some stray comments they made during their stakeout did not support an inference of malice. Maness v. Daily, 307 P.3d 894 (Alaska 2013).

I, §§ 7 and 22 required the courts, not physicians, to protect and enforce those guarantees: In future non-emergency cases, a court may not permit a treatment facility to administer psychotropic drugs unless the court makes findings that comply with all applicable statutory requirements and, in addition, expressly finds by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed treatment is in the patient’s best interests and that no less intrusive alternative is available.

       Superior court's orders authorizing the patient's involuntary evaluation, commitment, and medication for treatment of mental illness was affirmed because the patient's attorney agreed that the nurse practitioner was an expert and did not question his testimony or opinions; and the court based its decisions upon the expert's testimony that there was no less restrictive alternative to the Alaska Psychiatric Institute and that the patient was not capable at that time of giving or withholding informed consent to medication.

       Dismissal of the husband’s action alleging that he suffered emotional distress caused by the medical center’s release of his wife to her daughter was appropriate, in part because his argument that the medical center failed to disclose facts to him where it had a duty to do so was without merit.

        Constitutionality of paragraph (7)(B). —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Definition of “gravely disabled” in subsection (7)(B) of this section is constitutional if construed to require a level of incapacity so substantial that the individual is incapable of surviving safely in freedom. Wetherhorn v. Alaska Psychiatric Inst., 156 P.3d 371 (Alaska 2007), overruled in part, In re Necessity for the Hospitalization of Naomi B., 435 P.3d 918 (Alaska 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to be constitutional, paragraph (7)(B) of this section must be construed so that the “distress” that justifies commitment refers to a level of incapacity that prevents the person in question from being able to live safely outside of a controlled environment. Wetherhorn v. Alaska Psychiatric Inst., 156 P.3d 371 (Alaska 2007), overruled in part, In re Necessity for the Hospitalization of Naomi B., 435 P.3d 918 (Alaska 2019).

        “Gravely disabled.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Patient who had bipolar I disorder was gravely disabled on the day of an involuntary commitment hearing; she could not properly access outpatient treatment because her thinking was so impaired, and without further treatment she would likely be hospitalized again. In re Necessity for the Hospitalization of Tracy C., 249 P.3d 1085 (Alaska 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not err in concluding that patient was gravely disabled as defined in subsection (7)(B); patient’s own testimony at the commitment hearing supported a psychiatrist’s conclusion that he lacked insight into his illness, and his equivocal and contradictory testimony about whether he would continue taking his medication for catatonia did not directly contradict the psychiatrist’s conclusion that he would not take his medication in the future. In re Jeffrey E., 281 P.3d 84 (Alaska 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion that patient was gravely disabled under subsection (7)(B) was not supported by clear and convincing evidence. The court’s decision to commit the patient for 30 days was based on partial and unclear evidence, much of which was hearsay, and was in tension with significant evidence in favor of the patient’s ability to function independently and live outside of a controlled environment. In re Stephen O., 314 P.3d 1185 (Alaska 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding that a patient is gravely disabled by clear and convincing evidence requires the superior court to have a firm belief in the fact that the patient could not live safely outside of a controlled environment, and has a condition of mental illness that, if left untreated, would cause him to suffer significant impairment of judgment, reason, or behavior. Patient’s willingness to get treatment if the court so ordered demonstrated his ability to reason and make autonomous choices, contrary to the involuntary commitment ordered. In re Stephen O., 314 P.3d 1185 (Alaska 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       State had the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, a respondent was gravely disabled and commitment was the least restrictive alternative because proving an inability to function independently with support, when relevant, was part of the burden to prove no less restrictive alternative to involuntary commitment. In re Hospitalization of Mark V., 375 P.3d 51 (Alaska 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any error in the jury instructions on the unanimity requirement relating to a finding of grave disability was invited error, and the patient waived any challenge to the instructions because he requested them; the patient did not object to the jury instruction and did not request a jury instruction that would require the jury to agree on a specific basis for a finding of grave disability, thus, his claim of error was waived when he expressly endorsed the instructions that were read to the jury. In re Necessity for the Hospitalization of Darren M., 426 P.3d 1021 (Alaska 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by granting the Alaska Psychiatric Institute's (API) commitment petition for the patient because its finding that she was gravely disabled was not clearly erroneous, as the physician testified that the patient did not have housing, her disorder was severe enough that she could not be expected to find housing on her own, and that she may not have been able to eat and shower regularly unless API provided her those remedies. The trial court found that her delusions of rape and bodily harm became more acute during the time she refused to take medication or participate in planning her treatment.
       In re Necessity for the Hospitalization of Naomi B., 435 P.3d 918 (Alaska 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Granting of a 30-day commitment order was appropriate because the individual was gravely disabled as clear and convincing evidence showed a substantial deterioration of the individual's previous ability to function independently—diagnosis of bipolar disorder, impaired judgment, bizarre behavior and speech, a high level of agitation, and hyper-verbosity—and the condition would continue if not treated. The individual lacked the ability to exist safely outside an institutional framework due to high-risk behaviors and inability to retain housing.

       (9)(B); although the doctor stated that the patient was not malnourished when admitted, she had no housing and had been evicted from apartments due to erratic behaviors, and while the doctor acknowledged that he heard about the patient's housing situation from her mother, the patient did not attempt to contradict that testimony, and as an expert, the doctor was entitled to rely on and testify regarding hearsay that informed his opinions and recommended treatment.

      <p>
       Clear and convincing evidence supported the trial court's finding that respondent was gravely disabled because it showed that respondent was suffering from schizophrenia, upon arrival his clothes were covered in feces and vomit and he was not keeping himself dry, attending to his toileting needs, or showering, and the trial court found that respondent's failure to acknowledge that he was covered in vomit and feces, understand that such a physical condition was a problem, or understand that his condition would lead to further deterioration and isolation was evidence of his grave disability. In re Necessity for the Hospitalization of Rabi R., 468 P.3d 721 (Alaska 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not clearly err when it found that the patient was gravely disabled and when it entered a 30-day involuntary commitment order because the patient broke all the windows in her family's home to release demons; her home was uninhabitable; she was not eating or sleeping well outside of the Alaska Psychiatric Institute; her psychiatrist opined she could not survive safely in the community; and her psychiatrist predicted her condition would continue to decline without appropriate treatment.

      <p>
       In a case in which a patient appealed a superior court's 30-day involuntary commitment order, the Supreme Court concluded that the patient demonstrated disorganized and delusional thinking. The patient's testimony meandered as she mentioned being beaten, kidnapped and held for ransom in connection with a government program, starring in films with John Wayne, and associating with other actors.

      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not err when it determined that there was no less restrictive alternative to involuntary commitment where a psychiatrist explained why living in a shelter, in the wilderness, or with family and friends were not feasible, In addition, it was not error to conclude that involuntary commitment at the facility, allowing the individual's psychosis to stabilize, was necessary before outpatient treatment became a feasible alternative.
       In re Marvin S., — P.3d — (Alaska July 3, 2019) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not err in concluding that the patient's involuntarily placement at the Alaska Psychiatric Institute (API) was the least restrictive treatment option because she was delusional and had not been taking her medicine since moving out of an assisted living facility; the assisted living facility required its residents to take prescribed medication, but she refused; she continued to deny her diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and refused medication despite her hospitalization at API; and she needed to stabilize in a controlled environment, but due to the medication requirement at the assisted living facility and her resistance to medication, API was the only viable environment for such stabilization.
       In re Necessity for the Hospitalization of Denise F., — P.3d — (Alaska Sept. 25, 2019) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case in which the superior signed a 30-day involuntary commitment order, the superior court did not err in finding that no less restrictive alternative than commitment existed because the patient did not appear to have anywhere to stay and was unlikely to follow up with treatment if not committed; the psychiatrist believed the patient's symptoms would continue if not treated. In re Necessity for the Hospitalization of Luciano G., 450 P.3d 1258 (Alaska 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not err when it found no less restrictive alternatives where it appropriately balanced the competing rights and interests, concluding that although she had shown improvement, her delusions caused impaired judgment and aggression, and the court was concerned about her ability to access a shelter, a medical provider, and a care provider given her current care provider's continued unwillingness to be alone with her.
       In re Necessity for the Hospitalization of Annika G., — P.3d — (Alaska Apr. 29, 2020) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no less restrictive alternative to involuntary commitment where, even if doctors could not say that the young mans condition would have improved with hospitalization, commitment would keep others safe from harm in the event his delusions suddenly worsened and he decided to use the weapons he had surrounded himself with at home.

       Appellant was properly admitted to a psychiatric facility because, although appellant’s alcohol abuse and inhaling gasoline fumes to get high originally caused appellant’s mental deficiencies, appellant was mentally ill within the definition in paragraph (12); “huffing” damaged the frontal lobe of appellant’s brain, resulting in dementia and personality disorder.

       Trial court's determination that the patient was likely to cause harm to others was supported by findings that the patient's partner had serious concern about his doing things that he was disavowing such as connecting an electric welder to their home's metal door, presence of bottles used to make Molotov cocktails, and a doctor's statements that the patient's delusions were resulting in behavior that posed a substantial risk to others.

       Superior court did not err in signing the 30-day involuntary commitment order as the patient was likely to cause harm to himself or others because the patient had been behaving erratically leading up to his leaving or being fired from the Veterans Administration; he acted irately at the airport with both a ticket agent and an officer, and he had loaded weapons in a gun case with no visible lock; and both the officer and a psychiatrist testified that they believed the patient's behavior was threatening.

      <p>
       Court did not clearly err in finding that involuntary civil commitment was appropriate in that an individual was likely to cause harm to others as a result of mental illness because the finding of likely to cause harm was supported by a treating facility psychiatrist's testimony that the individual regularly threatened physical harm to other patients and to the facility's staff, averted only by safety precautions, and that if released the individual would likely stop taking medications, deteriorate, cause a fight, and end up back in jail.

      <p>
       In a case arising after a report of harm was filed relating to a vulnerable adult resident in an owner’s facility, state law claims against the state agency and a licensing specialist were barred because the claims were based on actions taken during the monitoring of a licensed entity. Moreover, the owner’s claim was not based on a theory that the State breached a duty to supervise employees other than the intentional tortfeasor, but was merely a claim that the State negligently supervised or trained the licensing specialist; there was no evidence to support a negligent supervision claim based on a theory that the State breached a separate protective duty it owed to the owner.

      It is the policy of the state to recognize, appreciate, and reinforce the example set by its citizens who lead, believe in, and support a life of sobriety. It is also the policy of the state that alcoholics and intoxicated persons should not be criminally prosecuted for their consumption of alcoholic beverages and that they should be afforded a continuum of treatment that can introduce them to, and help them learn, new life skills and social skills that would be useful to them in attaining and maintaining normal lives as productive members of society.

       In a mother’s wrongful death action alleging that a city’s negligence led to her son’s death, the superior court did not err by giving an ordinary negligence instruction rather than requiring gross negligence to establish liability; because the mother’s claim of negligence concerned the city’s actions once the son was in custody rather than the decision to take the son into custody in the first place, the jury instruction stated the appropriate duty of care owed by the city.

       This provision does not immunize a city from liability or create a gross negligence standard of care for the actions taken by the city while a son was detained because his mother’s action for damages was not based on the decision to take the son into custody; the action was based on the city’s alleged violation of its duty of care to protect detainees from harm, including self-harm.

       Because the safety patrollers' duty to take people who appeared to be incapacitated by alcohol or drugs in a public place into protective custody was mandatory rather than optional, this statute authorized members of the safety patrol to use a limited amount of force in order to assist an incapacitated person to an approved facility, and the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on lawful force.

       The 1989 amendment to subsection (a) of this section, imposing a two-year residency requirement for applicants, is un- constitutional; the former one year requirement in subsection (d) is the applicable period, since no appeal is pending. Lindly, et al. v. Malone, Superior Court, 3rd Jud. Dist. 3AN-90-02586 CI (1990). (The 1991 amendment to this section codified this decision).

Vest v. Schafer, 757 P.2d 588 (Alaska 1988), cert. denied, 491 U.S. 904, 109 S. Ct. 3184, 105 L. Ed. 2d 693 (U.S. 1989).

       The Longevity Bonus Program creates an exclusive class that is to receive special benefits due to the length of the class member’s residence in Alaska and thus is unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution and § 1, art. I, of the state constitution. Schafer v. Vest, 680 P.2d 1169 (Alaska 1984), (decided prior to 1984 amendments).

     <p>
      The legislature finds that there is a need for multipurpose senior centers in certain areas of the state to provide certain services for elderly persons, that this need can be at least partially met utilizing nonprofit corporations which would undertake the establishment of multipurpose senior center projects, and that the establishment of these projects constitutes a public purpose worthy of the cooperation of the state.

       Rights of persons with disabilities.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Persons with disabilities have the same legal rights and responsibilities guaranteed all other persons by the Constitution of the United States and federal laws and by the constitution and laws of the state. An otherwise qualified person may not be excluded, by reason of having a disability, from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity that receives public funds. Some persons with disabilities may be unable, due to the severity of their disability, to exercise for themselves all of their rights in a meaningful way; for others modification of some or all of their rights is appropriate. The procedure used for modification of rights must contain proper legal safeguards against every form of abuse, must be based on an evaluation of the social capability of the person by qualified experts, and must be subject to periodic reviews and to the right of appeal to higher authorities.
