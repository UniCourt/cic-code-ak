      When the commission of a crime commenced outside the state is consummated inside the state, the defendant is liable to punishment in this state even though out of the state at the time of the commission of the crime charged, if the defendant consummated the crime through the intervention of an innocent or guilty agent, or by other means proceeding directly from the defendant.

       If the prohibited result occurs in a place other than the place of the conduct which occasioned it, the location of the result may fairly be deemed the place where the crime is “consummated.” Wheat v. State, 734 P.2d 1007 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).

      <p>
       The state of Alaska is vested with authority to convict an individual for the crime of custodial interference when all the acts constituting the offense were committed outside of the state, since the location of the injurious result (Alaska) flowing from the out-of-state conduct is the place where the crime is “consummated” pursuant to this section.

      </p>
      <p>
       While there is no statute of limitations in Alaska for the offense of murder, the crime of manslaughter is subject to a five-year statute of limitations. Padie v. State, 594 P.2d 50 (Alaska 1979).

        Speedy trial. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant becomes formally accused for speedy trial purposes under the Alaska Constitution not just upon indictment or arrest but also when the State files an information charging the defendant with a crime because (1) the filing of an information marks the beginning of litigation against a defendant, (2) filing an information clearly manifests a prosecutor's decision to prosecute, and (3) the filing of an information is sufficient to toll the statute of limitations on a criminal charge.

       , where the state had probable cause to believe that defendant had committed perjury on his medical license application at the time of an affidavit supporting a search warrant for his personnel file, but did not commence the prosecution within one year of the affidavit’s date.

        Defendant may not be convicted of time-barred lesser included offense. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as a defendant may not be charged with a time-barred offense, he may not be convicted of it, even as a lesser offense included in one which is not time-barred. Padie v. State, 557 P.2d 1138 (Alaska 1976).

      </p>
      <p>
       A criminal trial jury may be instructed on the elements of a lesser included offense when the statute of limitations has run on the lesser offense but not the charged offense. Padie v. State, 557 P.2d 1138 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant was charged with first degree murder and the statute of limitations had run on the lesser offense of manslaughter, while the jury should not be instructed that they might find defendant guilty of manslaughter, defendant was entitled to an instruction on the mitigating effects of passion and provocation, requiring the jury to acquit him if he presented such evidence in mitigation and the state did not negate it. Padie v. State, 557 P.2d 1138 (Alaska 1976).

       <b>
        Theft by receiving. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a criminal statute should not be construed as creating a continuing offense unless it plainly appears that the legislature intended to define the offense as a continuing course of conduct, where the defendant committed the offense of theft by receiving when he discovered that an antique rifle was most likely stolen, his motion to dismiss a prosecution commenced nine years later should have been granted. Saathoff v. State, 991 P.2d 1280 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999), aff'd, 29 P.3d 236 (Alaska 2001).

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The promoting prostitution in the second-degree count in defendant's indictment was not barred by the statute of limitations because a prosecution for a class B felony sex trafficking offense may be commenced at any time.
       Williams v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. May 13, 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A statute of limitations can be waived
       </b>
       if the trial court determines that the following prerequisites have been met: (1) The waiver is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary; (2) it is made for the defendant’s benefit and after consultation with counsel; and (3) the defendant’s waiver does not handicap his defense or contravene any other public policy reasons motivating the enactment of the statute. Padie v. State, 594 P.2d 50 (Alaska 1979).

        Case-by-case analysis as to waivability issue. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although most courts have treated the waivability issue as dependent on whether a statute is treated as jurisdictional or as an affirmative defense, this arbitrary distinction should be abandoned in favor of a case-by-case analysis focusing on the language of the applicable statute of limitations and the public policies behind its enactment. Padie v. State, 594 P.2d 50 (Alaska 1979).

       Because a criminal statute should not be construed as creating a continuing offense unless it plainly appears that the legislature intended to define the offense as a continuing course of conduct, where the defendant committed the offense of theft by receiving when he discovered that an antique rifle was most likely stolen, his motion to dismiss a prosecution commenced nine years later should have been granted.

       Trial court did not err by allowing the jury at defendant's first trial to return verdicts on the assault and theft charges after it was unable to reach a verdict on the first-degree robbery charge because theft was not a lesser-included offense of robbery and, under the court's decision in the

Because the trial court did not enter judgment against defendant until all of the charges were resolved, retrial on the greater offense of robbery was not barred by the double jeopardy clause.

       By appealing, the accused waives the right to thereafter plead once in jeopardy when he has obtained a reversal of the judgment even as to that part of it which acquitted him of the higher while convicting him of the lower offense.
       When, at his own request, he has obtained a new trial, he must take the burden with the benefit and go back for a new trial of the whole case. United States v. Frank, 8 Alaska 436 (D. Alaska 1933).

      The Violence Against Women Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2265 (VAWA) requires the State of Alaska to enforce tribal protection orders and foreign protection orders, even where those orders are not registered as required by Alaska law. The unregistered protective order must meet due process requirements, including notice and the opportunity to be heard. If the order would qualify for arrest of the violator under an equivalent Alaska law, the violator may be arrested. The legislature is encouraged to revise Alaska's statutes to comply with VAWA.

      <p>
       The Alaska legislature has classified both reckless driving and operating or driving an automobile under the influence of intoxicating liquor as misdemeanors.
       Thus, a state trooper who arrived at an accident scene could not arrest a driver without a warrant for either reckless driving or drunk driving since neither of these offenses was committed or attempted in his presence.

        Scope of search and seizure. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Unquestionably, when a person is lawfully arrested, the police have the right, without a search warrant, to make a contemporaneous search of the person of the accused for weapons, for the fruit of the crime, or for implements used to commit the crime.
       This right to search and seize without a search warrant extends to things under the accused’s immediate control and, to an extent depending on the circumstances of the case, to the place where he is arrested.
       The rule allowing contemporaneous searches is justified by the need to seize weapons and other things which might be used to assault an officer or effect an escape, as well as by the need to prevent the destruction of evidence of the crime — things which might easily happen where the weapon or evidence is on the accused’s person or under his immediate control.
       But these justifications are absent where a search is remote in time or place from the arrest. Merrill v. State, 423 P.2d 686 (Alaska), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1040, 87 S. Ct. 1497, 18 L. Ed. 2d 607 (U.S. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       Officers may search and seize not only the things physically on the person arrested, but also those things within his immediate physical control. McCoy v. State, 491 P.2d 127 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       A search which is reasonable at its inception may violate the 4th amendment by virtue of its intolerable intensity and scope.
       The scope of the search must be strictly tied to and justified by the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible. McCoy v. State, 491 P.2d 127 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a search goes far beyond defendant’s person and the area into which he could reach to obtain a weapon to harm the officer or escape or evidence which he might conceal or destroy, it is unreasonable. McCoy v. State, 491 P.2d 127 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is reasonable for the arresting officer to search the person arrested in order to remove any weapons that the latter might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape.
       Otherwise, the officer’s safety might well be endangered, and the arrest itself frustrated.
       In addition, it is entirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for, and seize, any evidence on the arrestee’s person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction.
       The area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary items must be governed by a like rule.
       There is ample justification, therefore, for a search of the arrestee’s person and the area within his immediate control. There is no comparable justification, however, for routinely searching any room other than that in which an arrest occurs. McCoy v. State, 491 P.2d 127 (Alaska 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once warrantless searches beyond the area of the arrestee’s immediate control are allowed, the 4th amendment, with its “reasonableness” requirement, suggests no rational limits to circumscribe the search.
       Searches of the person, on the other hand, have their own inherent physical limitations.
       Thus, there is less danger that this exception to the warrant requirement will become unrestrained. McCoy v. State, 491 P.2d 127 (Alaska 1971).

       Adequate protection for the arrestee’s legitimate interests in privacy will be provided by the following restrictions on warrantless incidental searches of the person: (1) the arrest must be valid — probable cause for the arrest must exist or the search is unconstitutional; (2) the search must be roughly contemporaneous with the arrest, at least within the boundaries suggested by United States v. De Leo, 422 F.2d 487 (1st Cir. Mass.), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1037, 90 S. Ct. 1355, 25 L. Ed. 2d 648 (U.S. 1970); (3) the arrest must not be a pretext for the search; a search incident to a sham arrest is not valid.
       The search must be incident to the arrest, and not vice versa; (4) the arrest must be for a crime, evidence of which could be concealed on a person. McCoy v. State, 491 P.2d 127 (Alaska 1971).

       While in most felony cases the incidental search may well turn out to be reasonable, the nexus between the item to be seized and the criminal behavior involved is more difficult to establish in cases involving arrest for such offenses as traffic violations and vagrancy.

       If he does not act immediately after the offense has been committed, he can, thereafter, make arrests only by procuring a warrant and proceeding in accordance with its terms.
       In order to justify a delay, there should be a continued attempt on the part of the officer or person apprehending the offender to make the arrest; he cannot delay for any purpose which is foreign to the accomplishment of the arrest. Herrin v. State, 449 P.2d 674 (Alaska 1969).

       When the police responded to a request for a welfare check at defendant’s home, defendant became belligerent; he kicked at two officers, attempted to bite an officer, and continued to scream and swear; the officers’ initial deployments of the taser were objectively reasonable because the officers were faced with an immediate threat of bodily harm from defendant kicking and biting them in a rapidly deteriorating situation in the home. However, when defendant was handcuffed, seated on the floor, and then placed on his stomach, the need for force changed. The superior court erred by failing to consider whether the police department’s policy on taser use or the nature of the officers’ actions provided notice that the force they used may have been excessive under the Fourth Amendment.

       When examination of the totality of the circumstances reveals that the level of hindrance to the dual statutory purposes is justified in light of the exigencies of the case, lack of literal compliance with the knock-and-announce requirements of this section may be excused. Sandland v. State, 636 P.2d 1196 (Alaska Ct. App. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where police officers saw objects deposited outside a window, parted the window curtains and looked inside, saw defendant and, on his kitchen table, plates, measuring spoons, and a gun, and ordered him to freeze and entered through the window, any noncompliance with the provisions of this section was excusable because of the existence of “exigent circumstances.” United States v. Fluker, 543 F.2d 709 (9th Cir. Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Strict compliance with the knock and announce rule is not required when a balancing test indicates that the exigencies outweigh the hindrance to the dual purposes behind the rule of respecting individual’s privacy and minimizing the destruction of property. Trosper v. State, 721 P.2d 134 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Exigent circumstances justified police entry into a residence where defendant and the victim were present because the officers were responding to the second report of an assault at the residence that evening, and heard a male and female yelling inside; the police reasonably believed the female was in danger, obviating the need to knock and announce.

       Where a police officer knocked on the motel room door, and in response to a question in the room, used a ruse; there was activity in the room, after which codefendant opened the door a few inches; the police officer then said it was the police; codefendant attempted to close the door but the police officer pushed it open; and once inside, announced that he was there pursuant to a search warrant, although there was no literal compliance with the statutory knock and announce requirements in that the police officer stepped into the room before announcing his purpose, the police conduct constituted substantial compliance. Lockwood v. State, 591 P.2d 969 (Alaska 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Though the “knock and announce” rule requires that the police announce their authority and purpose before breaking into dwellings to execute a search warrant, there was substantial compliance with the “knock and announce” sections where the defendant had called the police to turn herself in for possessing over five pounds of marijuana, she refused to admit the police when they arrived, the police staked out her house while they acted to secure a warrant, they knocked on the door after securing the warrant, announced “It’s the police,” waited approximately a minute without getting a response, and forced open the door. Fleener v. State, 686 P.2d 730 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Police substantially complied with the knock and announce requirement by announcing their identity and their intent to search while simultaneously entering defendant’s hotel room, and exigent circumstances excused further compliance where police had reason to believe that defendant was armed and that evidence might be destroyed.

        When a person is arrested for operating a motor vehicle in violation of state or local drunken driving ordinances and requests to contact an attorney, subsection (b) of this section requires that arrestee be afforded a reasonable opportunity to do so before being required to decide whether or not to submit to a breathalyzer test; and where arrestee is denied that opportunity, subsequently obtained evidence, whether in form of test results or of refusal to take test, must be suppressed. Copelin v. State, 659 P.2d 1206 (Alaska 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory right to contact and consult with counsel prior to being required to decide whether or not to submit to a breathalyzer test is not an absolute one, which might involve a delay long enough to impair testing results, but, rather, a limited one of reasonable time and opportunity that can be reconciled with the implied consent statutes. Copelin v. State, 659 P.2d 1206 (Alaska 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The result of a breathalyzer test secured in violation of the right to counsel should be excluded in a civil license revocation proceeding. Whisenhunt v. State, Dep't of Pub. Safety, 746 P.2d 1298 (Alaska 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though a police officer violated Copelin by not offering defendant the opportunity to try to contact an attorney before the breath test as required by this section, the officer cured the violation as, after defendant expressly told the officer that he had declined to take the breath test because he had not had the opportunity to talk to a lawyer, the officer offered to let defendant try to contact an attorney. Hostetter v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Dec. 3, 2014).

       <p>
        Defendant’s statutory right to call an attorney under subsection (b) of this section was not violated when he was told that he could call his attorney when he got to the station after his DUI arrest; further, the police had no obligation to expressly offer a telephone call to defendant or to remind defendant of his earlier request to speak to attorney.

        , or Alaska R. Crim. P. 5(b) by interfering with his right to contact an attorney before deciding to submit to the test; reasonable interpretation of the record showed that defendant did not invoke his right to contact an attorney before deciding whether to submit to a breath test and that police did not interfere with that right because the only reference that defendant made regarding an attorney was his statement that perhaps he would need to speak with an attorney regarding why he was being charged with felony DUI while his last DUI offenses were misdemeanors.

        In a driving under the influence case, police did not violate defendant’s right to counsel by prohibiting her from accessing her cell phone. Defendant merely commented that her cell phone was in her pocket and thus did not invoke her right to consult with an attorney regarding whether to take a breath test. Wing v. State, 268 P.3d 1105 (Alaska Ct. App. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding that defendant did not invoke her right to a phone call when she asked if she got a phone call, the officer responded “Uh huh,” and defendant did not respond but agreed to provide a breath sample without asking to make a call, was proper. Accordingly, the results were not subject to suppression. Clark v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Apr. 22, 2015).

        Although, after an unsuccessful attempt to contact a particular attorney at his business number, the police officer did not attempt to call him at home, the police officer provided defendant with a reasonable opportunity to contact an attorney where defendant was offered the use of a telephone book several times over the course of the DWI processing; the officer asked if there was anyone else defendant wished to call; and defendant’s request had come near the end of the observation period.

        Where, during defendant’s telephone conversation with his attorney, a police officer stood next to defendant and took notes on the conversation and, despite specific requests by both defendant and his attorney, the police failed to make even a minimal effort to accommodate defendant’s right to communicate privately with his attorney, defendant was deprived of his right, under this section and Cr. R. 5(b), to a reasonable opportunity to contact his attorney; all evidence subsequently obtained by police from defendant, including defendant’s refusal to take a breathalyzer test and the videotape of his conduct, had therefore to be suppressed.

        The police failed to take reasonable steps to assure that a defendant had privacy in conversing with his attorney where an officer’s presence throughout the duration of the call, the officers’ repeated conduct that affirmatively intruded on the defendant’s attempts to communicate with counsel, and the activation of a tape recorder precluded him from having any kind of meaningful discussion with his attorney.

      <p>
       “Arrest,” as used in Crim.
       R. 45, which provides for a 120-day speedy trial period, must be defined in conformity with the statutory definition of an arrest. G.D. v. State, 681 P.2d 366 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not arrested on the date of the child-in-need-of-aid hearing, and the 120-day speedy trial period did not begin to run until he was served with a copy of the information charging him with sexual assault in the first degree and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. G.D. v. State, 681 P.2d 366 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a defendant was suspected of driving while intoxicated leading to an injury accident, was informed that he could submit to a blood test at the hospital or be arrested and transported to the state police where he would be required by law to submit to a breath test to determine his blood-alcohol level, was released after the blood sample was taken, and was never handcuffed or moved from the hospital, the trial court could find that, although the defendant was in police custody, the custody never amounted to an arrest as defined in this section. Greenawalt v. Municipality of Anchorage, 692 P.2d 983 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Reading Cr. R. 45 and this section together, the time for trial begins to run from the date the defendant is arrested and held to answer for the commission of a specific crime as well as any subsequent charges arising out of the same conduct or same criminal episode. Knowlton v. State, 795 P.2d 1287 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).
      </p>

       The arrest of a parolee for a parole violation, which is an independent crime, did not trigger the beginning of the 120-day period for prosecution of the underyling offense under Crim. R. 45. Knowlton v. State, 795 P.2d 1287 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The differing purposes governing parole revocation proceedings and criminal trials warranted a conclusion that defendant was not “held to answer” for the commission of the crime of forgery by virtue of his arrest for violating the conditions of his parole, even though the condition violated was that defendant refrain from committing further crimes.

       Defendant was properly convicted of fourth- and sixth-degree controlled substance misconduct because the evidence against him was obtained lawfully inasmuch as defendant voluntarily disclosed his possession of a pocket knife as soon as he was asked and readily consented to having a police officer take control of the knife for the duration of their encounter, and the discovery of a pipe and marijuana gave the officer an articulable reason to believe that defendant might be carrying additional evidence of a drug offense, which authorized the officer was to conduct a pat-down search of the rest of defendant's pockets even though the officer had already decided that he was going to issue a summons to defendant and then allow him to leave.

        Independent assessment of conditions of release required. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court was not entitled to clarification of the appellate court’s order to set defendant’s bail because it was up to the superior court to inquire into the assets available to defendant’s family to meet the monetary component of her bail, the appropriate legal framework for the analysis was set out in the Alaska Constitution, the superior court should also consider its obligations under the bail statute, the statutory restrictions were predicated on the assumption that there had already been a full inquiry into the available assets, and specific findings were needed the trial court’s justification for imposing the $ 500,000 cash or corporate surety monetary condition.
       West v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Sept. 2, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the superior court was required to independently assess defendant's conditions of release, and the supreme court was unable to say that defendant received the hearing to which he was entitled, his case was remanded to the superior court so that it could conduct the independent review.
       Torgerson v. State, 444 P.3d 235 (Alaska Ct. App. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       At a first bail review hearing, a judicial officer is required to assess a defendant's conditions of release anew; at a defendant's first bail review hearing, a court is required to conduct an independent assessment of the defendant's conditions of release, and the court may not simply defer to the bail conditions imposed at a defendant's first court appearance. Torgerson v. State, 444 P.3d 235 (Alaska Ct. App. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       When subsections (c) and (d) are read together, it is clear that a defendant need not present any “new” information at the first bail review hearing under subsection (c), that is, the defendant need not present any information that was not previously known at the time of the defendant's first appearance; instead, at a first bail hearing, a defendant who remains in custody is “entitled” to have the conditions reviewed by a judicial officer.
       Torgerson v. State, 444 P.3d 235 (Alaska Ct. App. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Requirement that judges conduct an independent assessment of a defendant's conditions of release at the first bail review hearing affords defendants a meaningful opportunity to consult with their attorney and gather any necessary information relevant to the bail decision; it also allows the court an opportunity to explain its bail decision, in order to help foster understanding of the decision by the defendant and the public, and to allow for meaningful appellate review. Torgerson v. State, 444 P.3d 235 (Alaska Ct. App. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the superior court was required to independently assess defendant's conditions of release, and because the court of appeals was unable to say that defendant received the bail review hearing to which he was entitled, the case was remanded to the superior court to conduct that independent review.

       Many people do not carry much cash on their person.

      <p>
       Statutory presumption of dangerousness is largely meaningless in a case where the court has already found the defendant to be dangerous and has already accounted for that dangerousness in the court's bail order; likewise, a statutory presumption that a defendant is a flight risk is irrelevant in a case where that presumption was apparently rebutted, and no appearance bond was ever imposed.

      <p>
       Although he may not deny bail to an accused, prior to conviction, the trial judge can consider danger to the community as a factor in assessing the amount of bail or fixing the terms of a conditional release.

      </p>
      <p>
       It was not clear that application of the new bail statute to defendant's case would make any material difference to his bail, as the superior court rescinded its no-bail order and set conditions of release; the new bail statute had essentially the same standard that applied under the former bail statute once the no-bail presumption had been rebutted, as it had been in defendant's case, plus under the new statute, defendant would be subject to the same bail restrictions as under the former statute.

       Because the State did not ultimately present any new information regarding James's conduct or dangerousness, the superior court should not have increased defendant's performance bond and should have declined further review.

      <p>
       To the extent superior court might have been wrong in its estimation of defendant's ability to pay, it was incumbent on him to object to the $ 50,000 bond on that basis and provide sufficient financial information to allow the court to assess his argument; without this kind of record, the court would not second-guess the superior court's reasons for imposing the bond, nor assume the amount was outside defendant's ability to pay.

       State properly conceded that the trial court erred in refusing to hear testimony regarding the ability of defendant's family to post a $25,00 cash-only performance bond and in failing to provide case-specific reasons for why that amount of monetary bail was necessary given the factors set fort in AS § 12.30.011(c), the prohibitions on excessive bail in U.S. Const. amend.

       Monetary amount imposed for bail constituted an abuse of discretion because the superior court approved a highly restrictive bail release plan with electronic monitoring, house arrest, and partial third-party custodians; appellant agreed to augment that plan with a $10,000 unsecured appearance bond and a $3,000 cash-only performance bond; it was not clear why imposing an additional $17,000 beyond what appellant's family had the ability to pay would make the community any safer or her bail plan materially more robust; and the superior court was required to impose the least restrictive bail conditions that would reasonably ensure appellant's appearance and the safety of the community.

       Trial court erred in reconsidering the monetary component of defendant's bail because, despite repeated hearings on remand, the court did not sufficiently explain why a $250,000 all-cash appearance bond was the least restrictive monetary amount necessary in light of the other supervisory bail conditions in place.

      <p>
       Superior court was not entitled to clarification of the appellate court’s order to set defendant’s bail because it was up to the superior court to inquire into the assets available to defendant’s family to meet the monetary component of her bail, the appropriate legal framework for the analysis was set out in the Alaska Constitution, the superior court should also consider its obligations under the bail statute, the statutory restrictions were predicated on the assumption that there had already been a full inquiry into the available assets, and specific findings were needed the trial court’s justification for imposing the $ 500,000 cash or corporate surety monetary condition.

       Superior court considered defendant's request that he be permitted to post only 10 percent of the appearance bond, but rejected the request because a 100 percent deposit was required to reasonably assure defendant's future court appearances, given his prior convictions for failure to appear; no abuse of discretion was found.

       Although he may not deny bail to an accused, prior to conviction, the trial judge can consider danger to the community as a factor in assessing the amount of bail or fixing the terms of a conditional release. He is in a far better position than an appellate court to assess the evidence and to determine, in the first instance, what alternatives are available, and the amount of bail that should be required.

      <p>
       Monetary amount imposed for bail constituted an abuse of discretion because the superior court approved a highly restrictive bail release plan with electronic monitoring, house arrest, and partial third-party custodians; appellant agreed to augment that plan with a $10,000 unsecured appearance bond and a $3,000 cash-only performance bond; it was not clear why imposing an additional $17,000 beyond what appellant's family had the ability to pay would make the community any safer or her bail plan materially more robust; and the superior court was required to impose the least restrictive bail conditions that would reasonably ensure appellant's appearance and the safety of the community.

       Although he may not deny bail to an accused, prior to conviction, the trial judge can consider danger to the community as a factor in assessing the amount of bail or fixing the terms of a conditional release.

       Subsection (b), which denies release or bail before sentencing or pending appeal to persons convicted of an unclassified or class A felony, is not an unconstitutional invasion of the supreme court’s rule-making power since it does not conflict with any supreme court rule.

      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not deny substantive due process or equal protection rights since the average member of the class comprised of those convicted of unclassified felonies and class A felonies will serve a longer sentence and, therefore, present a greater risk of flight than the average offender convicted of a class B felony or a lesser offense and, in addition, it would not have been unreasonable for the legislature to conclude that the average unclassified or class A offender is more dangerous than the average class B or C offender; therefore, a legitimate basis exists for the legislative classification distinguishing unclassified and class A felonies from class B felonies. Stiegele v. State, 685 P.2d 1255 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly denied defendant's request for a bail hearing because he had a prior felony conviction within 10 years of his current conviction, the legislative history demonstrated that the legislature's purpose in revising the bail state in 2010 was to protect victims and the public from defendants who demonstrated a certain level of dangerousness, while protecting the right of other less dangerous offenders to bail release, the legislature intended the 10-year look back to be calculated from the date of the defendant's conviction of a class B felony, and, while the line the legislature drew was to some extent arbitrary, it did not render the statute unconstitutionally arbitrary.

       Superior court, in denying defendant's request for bail pending a sentence appeal, stated that it was not convinced that the proposed bail conditions ensured the safety of the community, but did not provide any explanation for this finding, nor acknowledge that the applicable legal standard was “reasonably assure” rather than “ensure.”
       Because the appellate court could not determine whether the court applied the proper legal standard to defendant's request, remand for reconsideration of the request was remanded with appropriate findings.

        Probable cause to believe that marijuana possession is illegal. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Court might properly issue a search warrant if the state establishes probable cause to believe that the marijuana is possessed for commercial purposes, or that the amount of marijuana is in excess of the permitted quantity. State v. Crocker, 97 P.3d 93 (Alaska Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was entitled to suppress evidence of marijuana plants seized from his home pursuant to a search warrant where the warrant application failed to establish probable cause to believe that defendant’s possession of marijuana was illegal. State v. Crocker, 97 P.3d 93 (Alaska Ct. App. 2004).

       <b>
        Anticipatory search warrants. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An anticipatory search warrant, i.e., one which is based upon an affidavit showing probable cause that at some future time certain evidence will be at the location set forth in the warrant, is constitutionally permissible and not invalid for lack of present probable cause. It is not precluded by the statutory authority of paragraph (3), which requires only reasonable belief of possession of the item for issuance of the warrant, without specifying that possession must be contemporaneous with the issuance, as distinct from the execution, of the warrant. Johnson v. State, 617 P.2d 1117 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       For an anticipatory warrant to be valid, there must be probable cause to believe that the items to be seized will be at the place to be searched at the time the warrant is executed, or in other words, that the warrant will not be prematurely executed. Johnson v. State, 617 P.2d 1117 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       In anticipatory warrant situations, the magistrate should insert a direction in the search warrant making execution contingent on the happening of an event which evidences probable cause that the item to be seized is in the place to be searched, rather than directing that the warrant be executed immediately or forthwith. Johnson v. State, 617 P.2d 1117 (Alaska 1980).

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that a person possesses an unspecified quantity of marijuana in his home does not, standing alone, establish probable cause to believe that the person is breaking the law. Without some additional indication of illegality, the search and seizure provision of Alaska Const. art. I, § 14 prohibits the issuance of a search warrant. State v. Crocker, 97 P.3d 93 (Alaska Ct.

       A person who is not present when a search warrant is executed does not have standing to complain of the state’s failure to comply with the “knock and announce” requirements of Alaska law. State v. Johnson, 716 P.2d 1006 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Police substantially complied with the knock and announce requirement by announcing their identity and their intent to search while simultaneously entering defendant’s hotel room, and exigent circumstances excused further compliance where police had reason to believe that defendant was armed and that evidence might be destroyed.

       The municipal police had no authority to unilaterally transfer a criminal defendant’s money seized by a search warrant because it was within the custody and exclusive jurisdiction of the court, and the transfer of the money without court approval to a federal agency violated this section, rendering the federal agency’s forfeiture actions invalid. Consequently, the municipality was liable for the full value of the resulting conversion. Johnson v. Johnson, 849 P.2d 1361 (Alaska 1993).

       Hearsay, if relevant, is evidence, and if it is such that, unexplained or uncontradicted, it would persuade a grand jury that it would warrant the conviction of the defendant at the trial, then it is sufficient evidence to justify the finding of an indictment.

      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment against defendant for escaping from a halfway house was invalid because it was based on an incident report — prepared by a staff member at the halfway house, relaying another resident's description of defendant's conduct, and introduced to the grand jury through the testimony of an uninvolved supervisor — that was not admissible under the business records exception and without the report the evidence before the grand jury was insufficient to support an indictment. The error was not rendered harmless by defendant's conviction. Wassillie v. State, 411 P.3d 595 (Alaska 2018).

       Although no provision of the United States or Alaska constitution specifically guarantees the right of an accused to be indicted by a grand jury free of prosecutor-instigated prejudice, a strong historical basis exists for holding that the grand jury should operate to control abuses by the government and protect the interests of the accused.

       When presenting a case to a grand jury, the prosecutor should not make statements or arguments which would influence the grand jury in a manner which would be impermissible at trial. Putnam v. State, 629 P.2d 35 (Alaska 1980).

       Absent some evidence that the prosecutor knew or should have known that the response to his question would contain improper evidence, he is not held answerable for the utterances of the witness.
       This does not mean to imply that a prosecutor need not be concerned with the answers which his questions might elicit.
       He remains under a duty to present to the grand jury only that evidence which he believes would be admissible at trial. Putnam v. State, 629 P.2d 35 (Alaska 1980).

       A grand jury may, sua sponte, reconsider a decision to return a “no true bill” and hear new evidence so long as the reconsideration takes place prior to the foreperson’s endorsing the indictment “no true bill” and signing it. Andreanoff v. State, 746 P.2d 473 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).

       Decision to reconsider a decision to return a “no true bill” was not coerced by the prosecution where after the prosecutor’s inquiries regarding possible lesser-included offenses, it became clear that the entire grand jury was interested in considering additional evidence and postponing its ultimate decision until that evidence was received.

      </p>
      <p>
       An indictment has a purpose — to require a defendant to stand trial for a criminal offense with which he is charged.
       If the indictment is not adequate to answer the purpose for which it is intended, then it is insufficient, regardless of the fact that it may meet all the formal statutory requisites and have all the appearances of validity. State v. Shelton, 368 P.2d 817 (Alaska 1962).

       There is no conflict between Criminal Rule 7(c) and the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for it has been established that the means and manner by which the victim met his death are not elements of the crime of murder. Flores v. State, 443 P.2d 73 (Alaska 1968).

        Use of conjunctive and disjunctive in indictment and instructions was not prejudicial. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was only one offense charged in one count of the indictment, i.e., one assault with a dangerous weapon, but the jury was told that the assault was directed at either or both of two people, though the conjunctive was used in the indictment and in one of the instructions and the disjunctive used in other instructions, this in no way operated to prejudice any of the defendant’s substantial rights.

       The charging words of an indictment for first degree murder, that the defendant “did, with deliberate and premeditated malice, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously kill one Don Iannitti by shooting said Don Iannitti with a .357 caliber magnum revolver,” should leave no doubt in the mind of a person of common understanding that the element of purpose was intended to be, and is, reflected in the words used in the indictment to describe the nature of the killing.

       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement of corroboration was based historically on the assumption or suspicion that the accomplice might expect to purchase immunity from punishment by falsely accusing and procuring the conviction of others.
        Implicit here was the assumption that the accomplice was not to be trusted in the story that he told. Oxenberg v. State, 362 P.2d 893 (Alaska), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 56, 82 S. Ct. 189, 7 L. Ed. 2d 128 (U.S. 1961).

        To meet the statutory requirement, the state must show no more than that the corroborating evidence strengthens or confirms the testimony of the accomplice; there is no requirement that every element of an offense testified to by an accomplice be independently corroborated by other evidence.

       <p>
        Evidence corroborates when it induces a rational belief that the narrative of the accomplice is a correct one; when it dispels the assumed notion that he was an inventor of facts and incidents.
        If it does this, then the element of distrust is removed, and the object of the statute is accomplished. Oxenberg v. State, 362 P.2d 893 (Alaska), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 56, 82 S. Ct. 189, 7 L. Ed. 2d 128 (U.S. 1961).

        In determining whether there is evidence sufficient to inspire the fact-finders with confidence in the story of the accomplice, it is impracticable to require that what the accomplice has said be put aside and that the other evidence be examined alone to see if it “tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime.” Oxenberg v.

When the defendant seeks to admit the evidence for any purpose, the defendant shall apply for an order of the court not later than five days before trial or at a later time as the court may, for good cause, permit. The defendant may, for good cause shown, apply for an order during trial if the request is based on information learned after the deadline or during the trial. After the application is made, the court shall conduct a hearing in camera to determine the admissibility of the evidence. If the court finds that evidence offered by the defendant regarding the sexual conduct of the complaining witness is relevant, and that the probative value of the evidence offered is not outweighed by the probability that its admission will create undue prejudice, confusion of the issues, or unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the complaining witness, the court shall make an order stating what evidence may be introduced and the nature of the questions that may be permitted.

       The trial court erred in excluding evidence regarding the victim’s prior sexual activity with the defendant where that evidence did not hinge on any inference concerning the victim’s character but was important because of what it revealed about the relationship between the victim and the defendant and how that might have influenced the defendant’s perception of whether consent to sexual activity had been given.

       Where the victim had previously falsely alleged that another man had sexually assaulted her on an earlier occasion and the state interjected the alleged rape into the present case and made its occurrence a central part of the case against defendant, defendant was entitled to litigate the truth or falsity of the victim’s earlier rape report, and because it was an abuse of discretion to exclude the testimony of the man accused on the earlier occasion, reversal was required.

        Confrontation with accuser. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The constitution forbids denying the accused face-to-face confrontation with an accuser in a criminal trial absent specific evidence and an express finding that the probable effect of the defendant’s presence on the witness would significantly impair the substance of the witness’s testimony.
       A mere finding of some general, or de minimis effect will not suffice. Likewise, generalized, subjective impressions or assumptions will not substitute for case-specific evidence. Blume v. State, 797 P.2d 664 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).

      <p>
       <b>
        Right to confront witnesses. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant’s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him was not violated where, in his trial for assault on his wife, his son testified from a smaller chair arranged perpendicular to where the defendant was sitting, and the trial judge’s finding that the child’s position relative to his father was “not really different from where their positions would be if he were in the regular witness chair” was not clearly erroneous. Brandon v. State, 839 P.2d 400 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The preponderance of the evidence standard cannot provide sufficient protection against violation of a defendant’s right to confrontation, and no dilution of the right of confrontation should be permitted without an express finding that the requirements of this section, including the requirements of
       <i>

        Requirements for showing inability to communicate. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section requires that a determination of the child’s inability to effectively communicate under paragraph (a)(2) must be based on case-specific evidence establishing that (1) the child witness would be traumatized, not by the courtroom generally, but by the presence of the defendant, (2) confrontation would pose a threat of serious emotional harm to the child; and (3) the use of the special procedure authorized under this section is therefore necessary to protect the welfare of the particular child witness who seeks to testify.

      </p>
      <p>
       This statute was modeled after the federal Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500.
       Therefore, when faced with questions requiring the interpretation of the statute the court has turned to federal case law for instruction. Putnam v. State, 629 P.2d 35 (Alaska 1980).

      <p>
       Alaska Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 governs pretrial discovery while the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500, governs discovery during trial.
       Although the same evidence may be discoverable under both the rule and the statute, they are not so overlapping as to be inconsistent. Putnam v. State, 629 P.2d 35 (Alaska 1980).

        Duty of state to preserve evidence. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the state’s duty to preserve any evidence which is discoverable by the defendant.
       This duty attaches once any arm of the state has first gathered and taken possession of the evidence in question. Putnam v. State, 629 P.2d 35 (Alaska 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The state’s duty to preserve evidence that is discoverable by the defendant attaches once any arm of the state has first gathered and taken possession of the evidence in question. In this case involving killing a moose same day airborne, the state never had possession or control of any items that might have been found at the remote kill site, so the duty to preserve evidence was never activated. March v. State, 859 P.2d 714 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).

       <b>
        Discovery of confidential materials. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The proper procedure to be followed when a party requests discovery of confidential materials is for the court to conduct an in camera inspection of those materials and then determine which, if any, are discoverable. As long as the party seeking discovery has a good faith basis for asserting that the materials in question may lead to the disclosure of favorable evidence, the trial court should conduct an in camera review before ruling on a request for discovery. March v. State, 859 P.2d 714 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).

      </p>
      <p>
       Where it appears that the evidence was lost or destroyed in good faith, the imposition of sanctions will depend upon the degree to which the defendant has been prejudiced. Putnam v. State, 629 P.2d 35 (Alaska 1980); Abdulbaqui v. State, 728 P.2d 1211 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the evidence in question was destroyed in bad faith or as part of a deliberate attempt to avoid production, sanctions will normally follow. Putnam v. State, 629 P.2d 35 (Alaska 1980); Abdulbaqui v. State, 728 P.2d 1211 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).

       Assuming, without deciding, that the state has a duty to preserve police dispatch tapes, the state court of appeals found that the state had met its burden of establishing that the destruction of the tape was done in good faith and had demonstrated that the defendant was not prejudiced by the tape’s destruction where. Even if the tape had been preserved, it would have been cumulative of other evidence and not particularly favorable to the defendant. Abdulbaqui v. State, 728 P.2d 1211 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).

       That evidence was deliberately not preserved in good faith as a result of ignorance or as part of a department policy, established practice, or anything of this nature will not automatically excuse the state’s breach of its duty.
       The mere fact of good faith does not make the state’s breach any less a violation of Alaska Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 or the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500. Putnam v. State, 629 P.2d 35 (Alaska 1980).

      <p>
       While there is generally no “work product” exception to production under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500, “mere jottings” or cryptic summaries of statements made by interviewed witnesses are not producible. Wright v. State, 501 P.2d 1360 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       As cryptic summaries of statements made by an interviewed witness, notes made by a district attorney do not qualify as producible statements under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500. Wright v. State, 501 P.2d 1360 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where notes taken by the district attorney were part of the record before the supreme court and consisted of seven pages of legal sized note paper filled with comments, questions, and one diagram which according to testimony were taken during a one hour interview between a witness and the district attorney, such notes did not qualify as a statement under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500, since they were neither a substantially verbatim statement of what the witness said nor were they ever approved by the witness.

       The destruction of notes prior to trial has been viewed as a device used by some law enforcement officials to avoid production under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500. Wright v. State, 501 P.2d 1360 (Alaska 1972).

      <p>
       If notes were destroyed in good faith, without the intent to avoid production, it is the general rule that their destruction is not a ground for reversal. Wright v. State, 501 P.2d 1360 (Alaska 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where notes taken by a police captain appear to have been destroyed in good faith by police personnel during the absence of the captain from the state, where they were in cryptic form, it is quite possible that they did not seem to be important documents and were destroyed during a periodic clean-up of the captain’s office; therefore their destruction cannot be viewed as prejudicial. Wright v. State, 501 P.2d 1360 (Alaska 1972).

      With the material excised, the court shall then direct delivery of the statement to the defendant for the use of the defendant. If, pursuant to this procedure, any portion of the statement is withheld from the defendant and the defendant objects to the withholding, and the trial is continued to an adjudication of the guilt of the defendant, the entire text of the statement shall be preserved by the state and, in the event the defendant appeals, shall be made available to the appellate court for the purpose of determining the correctness of the ruling of the trial judge.
      When a statement is delivered to a defendant, the court may recess the trial for the defendant’s examination of the statement and preparation for its use in the trial.

        No authority to dismiss indictment. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the trial court did not conduct a hearing or approve the civil compromise until after the State indicted defendant, and because Alaska law did not authorize the compromise of a felony crime, the court had no authority to dismiss the charges against defendant under the civil compromise statutes after defendant was indicted; thus, the trial court erred in dismissing the indictment.

        Accused has no right to dismissal. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the Alaska civil compromise statute, the decision whether to dismiss or prosecute is vested in the sound discretion of the trial court; and no right to dismissal is conferred upon the accused. State v. Nelles, 713 P.2d 806 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).

       <b>
        No prosecutorial consent to dismissal necessary. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no suggestion in the civil compromise statutes that the court’s power to dismiss is conditioned upon the agreement of the prosecutor; in fact, the contrary appears to be the case. State v. Nelles, 713 P.2d 806 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).

        No automatic stay of proceedings. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Filing of the notice of civil compromise did not automatically stay the proceedings, such that the State was barred from securing an indictment until after the trial court conducted the civil compromise hearing because the civil compromise statutes provided that the prosecution could not be stayed except as authorized by law; and there was nothing in the civil compromise statutes to suggest that a stay as a matter of law once a notice was filed.

      <p>
       The act constituting the crime of leaving the scene of an accident is the failure to stop and make the necessary exchanges of information or assistance after the accident has occurred.
       This omission is not one which causes injury to the private citizen within the meaning of the civil compromise statutes. Settlement of the claim for injuries resulting from the accident cannot settle the state’s claim for a violation of its laws. Hensel v. State, 585 P.2d 878 (Alaska 1978).

      <p>
       Trial court's finding that prosecution of the indictment violated double jeopardy was incorrect as the State's decision to indict him was not the result of prosecutorial vindictiveness or an attempt to secure two opportunities to prosecute him; and the State did not convene the grand jury and secure an indictment in response to defendant's notice of civil compromise.

       , the legislature has declared that felony assaults against spouses and former spouses are to be considered atypically serious, all else being equal. That provision, along with paragraph (5) of this section, embodies concern over the alarming frequency and devastating consequences of domestic violence. Pickard v. State, 965 P.2d 755 (Alaska Ct.

      If the party injured appears before the court in which the defendant is bound to appear, at any time before trial, and acknowledges in writing that satisfaction has been received for the injury, the court may, on payment of the costs incurred, order the prosecution dismissed and the defendant discharged. The order is a bar to another prosecution for the same crime.

       It was error to make defendant waive rights to remain silent and present a defense and submit to psychiatric exams to assert an involuntariness defense because (1) the court did not clearly understand the proposed defense's factual contours without letting defendant make a full offer of proof describing supporting evidence, (2) the facts were not necessarily inconsistent with involuntariness, and (3) the defense was distinct from insanity or diminished capacity.

       Documents suggested that petitioner might have been suffering from some mental health issues, possibly drug-related, at the time of the shooting, but they did not alone show that his attorney was incompetent for concluding that petitioner did not have a meritorious mental disease or defect defense that could have been raised at trial.

       The defendant’s abandonment of his diminished capacity defense, as a result of the trial court’s denial of his motion for a protective order to exclude expert testimony of a psychiatrist testifying against him, barred the defendant from raising on appeal the issue of whether or not the psychiatrist’s testimony should have been barred at the trial level. Meaningful appellate review is impeded in such situations by the uncertainty attendant to determining whether any error might ultimately have proven harmless. Sam v. State, 842 P.2d 596 (Alaska Ct.

       Defendant’s argument that the jury should not have been given the option of returning a verdict of guilty but mentally ill was rejected because trial court was obligated to do so under subsection (a) of this section; evidence of defendant’s mental diseases or defects was relevant and admissible to rebut his claim that his erratic behavior was due entirely to his ingestion of the drug and tended to prove the state’s allegations of third-degree assault.

      “Treatment,” for purposes of this section, means the therapeutic milieu, process and/or medication employed by a mental health professional to achieve a behavioral state in the guilty but mentally ill inmate who is no longer dangerous to public peace or safety. December 5, 1986 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The treatment and restrictions placed upon the guilty but mentally ill inmate need only last until a determination is made that the inmate is no longer dangerous to the public peace or safety. This determination does not mean that treatment must cease after the inmate is determined to be no longer dangerous. It means that the disabilities associated with this section may be removed upon determination that the inmate does not constitute a danger; he may then be “treated” like any other prisoner in need of psychological or psychiatric treatment. December 5, 1986 Op. Att’y Gen.
     </p>
     <p>
      While legislative intent involuntarily subjects the guilty but mentally ill inmate to most conventional mental health treatment methods, approaches which fall within the “spirit of intrusion” reflected in such examples as psychosurgery and medical or psychiatric programs involving adverse conditioning should be closely scrutinized and applied only pursuant to clearly defined policy. December 5, 1986 Op. Att’y Gen.

      The determination of whether a guilty but mentally ill inmate is a danger to public peace or safety rests with the commissioner. December 5, 1986 Op. Att’y Gen.

      While at present it appears that there is no department policy whereby the guilty but mentally ill inmate can receive a review of dangerousness, without a “dangerousness review” there could be guilty but mentally ill inmates who, while behaviorally indistinguishable from the mentally ill offender in the general population, may be denied furlough or parole pursuant to AS

       While the current statutory scheme requires the state to provide appropriate medical and psychiatric care to offenders found guilty but mentally ill, it does not call for any reduction in the overall length of confinement to be imposed. It strongly suggests that an offender whose crime is the product of a mental illness should not automatically be entitled to a more mitigated sentence than would have been appropriate had no mental illness existed.

       Whether a psychiatrist is qualified within the meaning of the statute is a determination to be made by the court; thus, because it was not clear from the record whether the superior court made its own independent determination or simply accepted the Alaska Psychiatric Institute's (API) representation, the matter was remanded for the superior court to appoint qualified API psychiatrists or psychologists unless there is a legitimate reason not to.

       Superior court erred in holding that the State would pay for one of the appointed experts and the Alaska Office of Public Advocacy, which was appointed to represent defendant, would pay for the other court-appointed expert because, upon certification from the court of appeals, the Supreme Court of Alaska held that court-appointed experts were neutral experts appointed to answer the statutory questions and any other questions requested by the court.

       The defendant’s abandonment of his diminished capacity defense, as a result of the trial court’s denial of his motion for a protective order to exclude expert testimony of a psychiatrist testifying against him, barred the defendant from raising on appeal the issue of whether or not the psychiatrist’s testimony should have been barred at the trial level. Meaningful appellate review is impeded in such situations by the uncertainty attendant to determining whether any error might ultimately have proven harmless. Sam v. State, 842 P.2d 596 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).

       Defendant was not illegally subjected to pre-trial psychological evaluations because defense counsel affirmatively told the trial court that he did not object and then actively worked to arrange and facilitate the psychological examinations.

      </p>
      <p>
       Use of defendant's statements to the two forensic psychologists was not barred because the record showed that the trial court had proper grounds for concluding that the mental examinations were authorized and defendant was not compelled to participate in the psychological examinations against his will, as defense counsel took repeated steps in the ensuing weeks to promote and facilitate these examinations and defendant was expressly warned by at least one of the forensic psychologists that he had the right not to participate in the examination and he agreed to participate in both examinations.

      According to the House Commentary (House J. Supp. No. 64, at 7 (June 2, 1982)), the not guilty by reason of insanity commitment procedure “provides substantial protection for the public by requiring a person criminally committed to bear the burden of demonstrating his lack of danger to others before he is released,” the focus being on whether the mentally ill defendant is a threat to public peace or safety.

       A defendant who, as a result of mental disease or defect, is incompetent because the defendant is unable to understand the proceedings against the defendant or to assist in the defendant’s own defense may not be tried, convicted, or sentenced for the commission of a crime so long as the incompetency exists.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c47s12.47.100ol1b">
       If, before imposition of sentence, the prosecuting attorney or the attorney for the defendant has reasonable cause to believe that the defendant is presently suffering from a mental disease or defect that causes the defendant to be unable to understand the proceedings or to assist in the person’s own defense, the attorney may file a motion for a judicial determination of the competency of the defendant. Upon that motion, or upon its own motion, the court shall have the defendant examined by at least one qualified psychiatrist or psychologist, who shall report to the court concerning the competency of the defendant. For the purpose of the examination, the court may order the defendant committed for a reasonable period to a suitable hospital or other facility designated by the court. If the report of the psychiatrist or psychologist indicates that the defendant is incompetent, the court shall hold a hearing, upon due notice, at which evidence as to the competency of the defendant may be submitted, including that of the reporting psychiatrist or psychologist, and make appropriate findings. Before the hearing, the court shall, upon request of the prosecuting attorney, order the defendant to submit to an additional evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist designated by the prosecuting attorney.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c47s12.47.100ol1c">
       A defendant is presumed to be competent. The party raising the issue of competency bears the burden of proving the defendant is incompetent by a preponderance of the evidence. When the court raises the issue of competency, the burden of proving the defendant is incompetent shall be on the party who elects to advocate for a finding of incompetency. The court shall then apply the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine whether the defendant is competent.

       A statement made by the defendant in the course of an examination into the person’s competency under this section, whether the examination is with or without the consent of the defendant, may not be admitted in evidence against the defendant on the issue of guilt in a criminal proceeding unless the defendant later relies on a defense under AS

       In determining whether a person has sufficient intellectual functioning to adapt or cope with the ordinary demands of life, the court shall consider whether the person has obtained a driver’s license, is able to maintain employment, or is competent to testify as a witness under the Alaska Rules of Evidence.

      <li id="t12c47s12.47.100ol1f">
       In determining if the defendant is unable to understand the proceedings against the defendant, the court shall consider, among other factors considered relevant by the court, whether the defendant understands that the defendant has been charged with a criminal offense and that penalties can be imposed; whether the defendant understands what criminal conduct is being alleged; whether the defendant understands the roles of the judge, jury, prosecutor, and defense counsel; whether the defendant understands that the defendant will be expected to tell defense counsel the circumstances, to the best of the defendant’s ability, surrounding the defendant’s activities at the time of the alleged criminal conduct; and whether the defendant can distinguish between a guilty and not guilty plea.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c47s12.47.100ol1g">
       In determining if the defendant is unable to assist in the defendant’s own defense, the court shall consider, among other factors considered relevant by the court, whether the defendant’s mental disease or defect affects the defendant’s ability to recall and relate facts pertaining to the defendant’s actions at times relevant to the charges and whether the defendant can respond coherently to counsel’s questions. A defendant is able to assist in the defense even though the defendant’s memory may be impaired, the defendant refuses to accept a course of action that counsel or the court believes is in the defendant’s best interest, or the defendant is unable to suggest a particular strategy or to choose among alternative defenses.

       In a hearing to determine competency under this section, the court may, at the court’s discretion, allow a witness, including a psychiatrist or psychologist who examined the defendant, to testify concerning the competency of the defendant by contemporaneous two-way video conference if the witness is in a place from which people customarily travel by air to the court, and the procedure allows the parties a fair opportunity to examine the witness. The video conference technician shall be the only person in the presence of the witness unless the court, at the court’s discretion, determines that another person may be present. Any person present with the witness must be identified on the record. In this subsection, “contemporaneous two-way video conference”

        Mandate of former AS 12.45.100 was of constitutional dimensions. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) of former AS 12.45.100 prohibited the trial, conviction and sentencing of a defendant who could not assist in his own defense or understand the proceedings against him. That statutory mandate is of constitutional dimensions. McKinney v. State, 566 P.2d 653 (Alaska 1977), overruled, Evans v. State, 645 P.2d 155 (Alaska 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The conviction of a person who is incompetent to stand trial violates due process of law.
       </b>
       Schade v. State, 512 P.2d 907 (Alaska 1973); Fajeriak v. State, 520 P.2d 795 (Alaska 1974); McKinney v. State, 566 P.2d 653 (Alaska 1977), overruled, Evans v. State, 645 P.2d 155 (Alaska 1982).

        And his sentence is therefore vulnerable to post-conviction attack.

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        This is true whether or not defendant presented issue of incompetency at trial.

      <p>
       <b>
        One of the primary reasons for requiring that defendant be competent
       </b>
       before standing trial is to safeguard the accuracy of the guilt finding process. Schade v. State, 512 P.2d 907 (Alaska 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Former AS 12.45.100 appeared to codify the common law rule.
       </b>
       Schade v. State, 512 P.2d 907 (Alaska 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the rule at common law that an accused should not be subjected to a criminal trial if he is in such a mental condition that he is unable to understand the proceedings against him or to properly assist in his own defense.
       Bosel v. State, 398 P.2d 651 (Alaska 1965);
       Schade v. State, 512 P.2d 907 (Alaska 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b) of former AS 12.45.100 was patterned after former 18 U.S.C. § 4244.
       </b>
       Bosel v. State, 398 P.2d 651 (Alaska 1965); Smiloff v. State, 579 P.2d 28 (Alaska 1978)(See now 18 U.S.C. § 4241 et seq.).
      </p>
      <p>
       The test in former AS 12.45.100 was substantially identical to the federal statutory standard of incompetency. Fajeriak v. State, 520 P.2d 795 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b) of former AS 12.45.100 was clear enough.

       Thessen v. State, 454 P.2d 341 (Alaska 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1029, 90 S. Ct. 588, 24 L. Ed. 2d 525 (U.S. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A defendant need not be proved certifiably incompetent to stand trial
       </b>
       before the court is required to order a psychiatric examination. Fajeriak v. State, 520 P.2d 795 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) of former AS 12.45.100 directed only that “reasonable cause” to believe that the defendant might be incompetent to stand trial be shown. Fajeriak v. State, 520 P.2d 795 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The defendant must have some minimum ability
       </b>
       to provide his counsel with information necessary or relevant to his defense.
       He must also be able to understand the nature of the proceedings sufficiently to participate in certain decisions about the conduct of the defense. Schade v. State, 512 P.2d 907 (Alaska 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Some strategic choices must be the product of meaningful communication between the defendant and his counsel. Schade v. State, 512 P.2d 907 (Alaska 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        But this does not mean that a defendant must possess any high degree of legal sophistication
       </b>
       or intellectual prowess. Schade v. State, 512 P.2d 907 (Alaska 1973); Smiloff v. State, 579 P.2d 28 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Numerous persons are subjected to criminal prosecution, even though they are of relatively low intelligence or are suffering from some significant emotional or physical impairment. Schade v. State, 512 P.2d 907 (Alaska 1973); Smiloff v. State, 579 P.2d 28 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Not every emotional flaw renders one incompetent to stand trial.
       </b>
       Schade v. State, 512 P.2d 907 (Alaska 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       The presence of some degree of mental illness is not an invariable barrier to prosecution.
       There may be an impaired functioning of some aspects of the defendant’s personality and yet he may still be minimally able to aid in his defense and to understand the nature of the proceedings against him. Schade v. State, 512 P.2d 907 (Alaska 1973); McKinney v. State, 566 P.2d 653 (Alaska 1977), overruled, Evans v. State, 645 P.2d 155 (Alaska 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       That there may be something mentally wrong with a defendant or that he may be emotionally unstable does not necessarily render him mentally incompetent to understand the proceedings against him. Fajeriak v. State, 520 P.2d 795 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Not every mental illness necessarily disables a defendant from functioning adequately in a criminal proceeding. McKinney v. State, 566 P.2d 653 (Alaska 1977), overruled, Evans v. State, 645 P.2d 155 (Alaska 1982).

       Policy cojoins with precedent to oppose an expansion of the doctrine of incompetency to include amnesia.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was competent to stand trial despite his attorney’s continuing objections that defendant could not meaningfully participate in his own defense. The trial court made its own independent findings and continued to make additional findings at later hearings, demonstrating its awareness that defendant’s situation was not necessarily stable and that the highly intrusive delusions that previously presented a barrier to defendant’s competency could quickly return. Gamble v. State, 334 P.3d 714 (Alaska Ct. App. 2014).

       The comprehensive and highly regimented provisions of the presumptive sentencing statute were enacted to assure that sentencing would become a predictable process and that disparity in sentencing between similarly situated offenders would be eliminated. Lacquement v. State, 644 P.2d 856 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the legislature enacted Alaska’s presumptive sentencing laws, the legislature declared that its primary goals were to attain reasonable uniformity in sentences and to eliminate unjustified sentencing disparity. Brown v. State, 4 P.3d 961 (Alaska Ct. App. 2000).

        Reasonable uniformity in sentences required. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The principle of reasonable sentencing uniformity requires a sentencing judge who decides that an offender deserves a sentence which is significantly different from sentences previously given to similarly situated offenders to expressly find some legitimate basis for the difference — some basis related to “legally relevant sentencing criteria.” That basis should be spelled out on the sentencing record, so that the defendant and a reviewing court can understand the reasons for the disparity.

       Benchmarks in sentencing range are intended to help courts avoid unjustified disparity in sentencing by forcing judges to articulate reasons for imposing atypical sentences and to foster the goal of better-informed appellate review of sentencing decisions.

        Deviation from sentencing benchmarks. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate courts should not place inflexible restrictions on a sentencing judge’s authority based on pre-established criteria. Instead, sentencing benchmarks serve only as guidelines, and that any sentencing decision ultimately must be justified on the particular facts of a defendant’s offense and background, evaluated in light of the sentencing criteria and the range of sentences authorized by the legislature. Phelps v. State, 236 P.3d 381 (Alaska Ct. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant was charged with and pled guilty to 23 offenses—including second-degree murder, first-degree assault, vehicle theft, and driving under the influence—after stealing a car and becoming involved in a high-speed chase, the trial court’s imposition of a 66-year sentence was not inappropriate given the totality of defendant’s conduct and his lengthy criminal history. Defendant’s conduct demonstrated a level of blameworthiness far exceeding the conduct of the typical defendants in vehicular homicide cases. Felber v. State, 243 P.3d 1007 (Alaska Ct. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals erred in ruling that the parole restriction made part of defendant’s sentence was excessive because it was not clearly mistaken; the sentencing court considered the relevant factors in fashioning its overall sentence and entered specific findings that the parole restriction was necessary to protect defendant’s children and society at large for an extended period of time, and was appropriate due to the severity of the case and defendant’s lack of remorse and concern.

       <b>
        The “clearly mistaken” test

      <p>
       Defendant’s one-year sentence for throwing urine on a correctional officer was not excessive or mistaken because, while the sentence was imposed primarily to deter other inmates from similar conduct by threating criminal sanctions, the judge was aware of and addressed the statutory criteria, including defendant’s serious criminal history, his lengthy sentence, his many disciplinary violations, and the judge’s comments indicated that he had very little hope for defendant’s rehabilitation.

       Defendant’s composite sentence was not excessive because, given the conduct underlying defendant’s original offenses and defendant’s frequent and serious violations of probation; the sentence was not clearly beyond that which a court might have imposed on an offender who rejected further probation and asked for a sentence comprised solely of active imprisonment.

       When applied to the adjustment of a presumptive sentence, the
       <i>
        State v. Chaney,
       </i>
       477 P.2d 441 (Alaska 1970), analysis, as stated in this section, should not be broadened into a consideration of all circumstances of the offense, as if the sentence were being imposed anew, without regard for the presumptive term.
       Instead, consideration of the
       <i>
        Chaney
       </i>
       criteria should focus specifically on the aggravating and mitigating conduct in the particular case.
       The presumptive term should remain as the starting point of the analysis, and the
       <i>
        Chaney
       </i>
       criteria should be employed for the limited purpose of determining the extent to which the totality of the aggravating and mitigating factors will justify deviation from the presumptive term. Juneby v. State, 641 P.2d 823 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982), modified, 665 P.2d 30 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court could properly conclude that the facts of the case and defendant’s background required it to sentence him to a term of eight years’ imprisonment with four years suspended for the interference with official proceedings conviction. Sentence was not excessive where defendant, a first-felony offender, had a record of assaultive behavior, where the offense was aggravated, where alcohol was involved, and where the court was concerned for the safety of the community.
       Bailey v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Sept. 30, 2009) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on evidence showing multiple acts of aggravated indecent exposure to a minor, and failure to appear for over 15 years, conviction on four misdemeanor counts was proper. While defendant’s composite sentence could not exceed one year under the Neal-Mutschler rule, the sentencing court was permitted to impose a composite sentence of one and a half years based upon a consideration of the factors set forth in this section; defendant’s offenses were among the most serious, his failure to appear prolonged the criminal prosecution, and he caused the victim to suffer emotional problems. Phelps v. State, 236 P.3d 381 (Alaska Ct. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       After defendants requested that a probation term be terminated and that they simply be sentenced to an active prison term, sentencing judges did not err in imposing less than the full term that was previously suspended after considering Chaney sentencing criteria in applying this section; a plea bargain did not require defendants to give up the right to reject further probation. State v. Henry, 240 P.3d 846 (Alaska Ct. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Aggravating factors were properly imposed to sentence defendant because (1) the record was clear that the court found only the
       AS 12.55.005(c)(15) and (21) factors, and (2) whether three prior convictions should have been counted as one made no difference as it did not affect the judge's sentencing authority to sentence defendant as a third felony offender.

      </p>
      <p>
       72-year suspended portion of defendant’s sentence was excessive because the sentencing court found that defendant’s conduct was extremely typical for possession of child pornography, it found reasons to be cautiously optimistic about his potential for rehabilitation, it did not find that 72 years was the appropriate period of time needed to motivate defendant or to protect the public if he were to violate any of the terms of his probation, and it made no findings to justify such a lengthy suspended term based on the individual circumstances of defendant’s case.

       Having found a statutory aggravator, a sentencing judge must weigh that factor in light of the sentencing criteria codified in this section to determine whether the presence of the aggravator shows a defendant to be an atypically serious offender or shows his crime to be more serious than a typical instance of the charged crime.

       Restriction on defendant’s parole eligibility was not clearly mistaken because his plea agreement left the terms of the sentence to the court, he did not seek to rescind the agreement on the basis that the restriction was outside its scope, and the superior court considered the statutory factors as they related to defendant’s dangerousness, community condemnation, general and specific deterrence, and that, without the restriction, the sentence would be too lenient.

       Defendant's composite sentence of 32 years for two counts of second-degree murder based on vehicular homicide was remanded to the trial court for reconsideration because the trial court erred by concluding that at 20- to 30-year benchmark sentencing range applied to first felony offenders convicted of second-degree murder arising from a vehicular homicide, as the

        Page

       benchmark range applied only to second-degree murders that arose from intentional assaults. The trial court also erred by concluding that defendant's sentence should be increased because his conduct endangered three or more people and it relied on an improper interpretation of community condemnation that incorporated raw emotion and notions of retribution.

       In reviewing a sentence of 25 years imprisonment with seven years suspended (18 years to serve) for a vehicular homicide involving three deaths, a sentence higher than any other that had been affirmed on appeal in Alaska, the fact that lesser sentences had been affirmed for such offense did not mean that they constituted the limit of sentencing discretion.

       A “worst offender” designation, standing alone, permits imposition of the maximum term for the single most serious offense.
       The designation does not, however, automatically permit consecutive sentences exceeding the maximum for the single most serious crime.
       In order to impose such a sentence, the court must actually find, as a matter of fact, that the defendant will continue to pose a danger to the community during the extended term and that his continued isolation is actually necessary. Such a finding does not necessarily justify pyramiding consecutive maximum sentences; rather, such a finding permits only an incrementally more severe sentence based on the actual need for protection of the public under the totality of the circumstances of the prosecution’s case. Hancock v. State, 741 P.2d 1210 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).

       Defendant had a colorable claim that his 99-year sentence for first-degree murder was excessive where he had no significant adult criminal record, did not appear to have a juvenile record, and appeared to have unaddressed mental health issues; defendant would have to show some reason to believe that his offense was mitigated or that his background was atypically favorable.

       Because defendant was a third felony offender, the high end of the presumptive sentencing ranges he faced by virtue of his convictions was the same as the maximum statutory penalties for those crimes.

       In a murder case, defendant’s 106 year sentence was proper where his criminal history stretched back to 1980, and he was on felony probation at the time of the murder. Defendant’s previous probation and parole supervision had done nothing to deter him from engaging in further criminal conduct, and similar measures were unlikely to deter him in the future.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial judge properly sentenced defendant to a sentence above the low end of the applicable presumptive range because defendant’s blood alcohol level was substantially above the legal limit, the driver of the vehicle that defendant rear-ended suffered a broken neck, defendant tampered with evidence when he prevailed on a bystander to remove the beer from his vehicle and hide it, and the sentencing judge was concerned about defendant’s potential for rehabilitation.

       Not all factors will be relevant to every parole eligibility determination, and the most relevant factors often will be public safety and potential for rehabilitation; a sentencing court must consider all of the statutory factors, determine which are relevant to the case, and support its overall sentence, including parole eligibility restrictions, with expressly articulated reasons backed by substantial evidence. State v. Korkow, 314 P.3d 560 (Alaska 2013).

       In sentencing the defendant, the court carefully considered the seriousness of the assault on the victim, its impact on her, and defendant’s criminal history. The judge evaluated possible probation conditions and imposed those addressing alcohol treatment, domestic violence, and anger management.

       Sentence imposed upon defendant for attempted medical assistance fraud, was within the permissible range of sentences that a reasonable judge would impose under the circumstances and was not clearly mistaken; the sentencing judge took into account defendant's lack of criminal history, her prospects for rehabilitation, and her remorse, but concluded that they were outweighed by the other sentencing criteria.

       Defendant was required to serve one year of his previously suspended jail time because he willfully failed to comply with his sex offender treatment programs on three separate occasions, and, although the court did not expressly address the statutory sentencing criteria individually, it was clear that the court focused on defendant's failure to pursue rehabilitative efforts in a meaningful way, and the resulting danger that defendant, because he was untreated, would re-offend.

       Sentence for manslaughter was not excessive because the sentencing court recognized the extreme recklessness of defendant's conduct when defendant fired a handgun while intoxicated, was concerned about defendant's admitted history of recklessly handling loaded firearms while intoxicated, found a need to express the community's condemnation and to try to achieve general deterrence, found that defendant's conduct was so reckless that it bordered on intentional, and noted that it was not convinced by defendant's explanation of what occurred.

       Defendant's composite sentence was not excessive when defendant pleaded guilty to second-degree assault and misdemeanor assault for assaulting defendant's paramour, the paramour's minor child, an adult, and a police officer because the court considered aggravating factors—defendant's conduct manifested deliberate cruelty, defendant knew or should have known that the victim was particularly vulnerable, and defendant's conduct was among the most serious included in the definition of second-degree assault—and defendant's rehabilitative potential.

       Defendant's composite sentence was not excessive when defendant pleaded guilty to second-degree assault and misdemeanor assault for assaulting defendant's paramour, the paramour's minor child, an adult, and a police officer because the court considered the appropriate aggravating factors and defendant's rehabilitative potential as did not have a lengthy criminal record, was intelligent, and had the support of family and friends.

       Superior court properly convicted defendant, following a jury trial, of second-degree sexual assault for vaginally penetrating his cousin (the victim) while she was unconscious because the evidence established that the victim was incapacitated and that defendant knew that she was incapacitated—she had four to six shots of whiskey, did not remember lying down in the bed in which she woke up, did not remember the sexual assault, and never would have consciously consented to have sex with defendant—defendant failed to explain how an error in the timing of the admission of the text messages prejudiced him, and the court engaged in a thorough review of the statutory criteria and explained in detail the reasons it imposed the sentence it did.

      <p>
       Defendant faced a presumptive sentencing range of three to five years' imprisonment for felony eluding and felony driving under the influence convictions, and a term of 30 days to one year for a driving while license revoked conviction. His composite sentence of 7 1/2 years to serve was not clearly mistaken because the trial court found that his conduct, engaging in a high-speed vehicle chase while high on drugs, showed a complete disregard for the safety of others. Also, defendant committed the offenses while on probation, with his driver's license revoked, and after serving significant periods of imprisonment.
       Debeaulieau v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 24, 2016) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       The relevant factors were applied when sentencing defendant, and while the judge did not specifically mention the word rehabilitation, many of his comments were directed to this sentencing factor; the judge concluded that defendant could not be rehabilitated on probation given his secretiveness and unwillingness to engage in meaningful conversations with his probation officer or the sex offender clinician, and thus defendant’s sentence was not clearly mistaken.

       It is insufficient for the trial judge to simply recite the sentencing factors set forth in State v.

       to restrict discretionary parole as part of a sentence of imprisonment; the statutory language is clear and uncontradicted by any legislative history, a sentencing court must consider all the enumerated criteria in the statute when restricting discretionary parole as a part of a sentence, not just public protection and the defendant’s reformation.

       A benchmark range is but a starting point for sentencing analysis, and any sound reason can justify a departure from the benchmark range; however, when the record fails to support a sentencing judge’s offered justifications for departing from a benchmark range, an appellate court should direct the sentencing judge to impose a sentence within the benchmark range.

       <p>
        When an offender is convicted of multiple crimes, the presumptive term for the most serious crime remains an important benchmark — a benchmark that is not to be exceeded without good reason.
        Nevertheless, the appropriate focus is no longer on the narrow issue of public danger, but rather on whether a composite sentence exceeding the presumptive term is warranted under the totality of the circumstances. Farmer v. State, 746 P.2d 1300 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).

       <p>
        A composite sentence of five years with two years suspended, imposed upon a first felony offender upon conviction of two counts of burglary in the second degree, one count of theft in the second degree, and one count of theft in the third degree, was not excessive, where defendant’s conviction of two separate burglaries and related thefts, and his admission of two additional burglaries and related thefts, justified a greater sentence than would a conviction of an isolated burglary and theft.

        Defendant was not entitled to credit for the excess time he served on his 1982 robbery offense toward his 1987 robbery offense, where the only connection shown between the earlier and later offenses was that the 1987 offense may have been committed while defendant was on parole on the 1982 offense and that the state originally used the 1982 conviction as a prior felony offense to enhance defendant’s sentence on the 1987 offense.

        Superior court properly denied defendant's request for credit against his sentence for the time he spent under the conditions of his release because the conditions—house arrest with supervision by one of two third-party custodians—did not approximate conditions of imprisonment, the 2015 amendments to the subject statute—authorizing sentencing credit for time spent on electronic monitoring—demonstrated that the legislature did not intend to authorize credit for time spent on house arrest or third-party custodianship unaccompanied by electronic monitoring.

       <p>
        Superior court properly denied defendant’s request for credit against his sentence for the time spent on electronic monitoring because prior case law, which concluded that constraints imposed by electronic monitoring were not the equivalent of incarceration for purposes of this section, was not originally erroneous.

       <p>
        Although credit for time already served in prison is awarded automatically by statute and is not dependent on the judge’s stating that credit should be given, judgment forms should expressly state that the defendant will receive credit for time served in order to protect defendants who may serve all or part of their terms in out-of-state prisons.

        Where a sentencing court, in imposing the original sentence, has unambiguously manifested its intent to require that a specified term of imprisonment be served in addition to time previously served, the Alaska Court of Appeals has not hesitated to hold that subsection (c) does not require additional credit to be given; conversely, where there has been ambiguity in a trial court’s sentencing remarks, the court has applied subsection (c) and required that credit be given for time previously served.

        Where defendant’s sentences were to be served consecutively to a sentence then being served for a parole revocation on an earlier offense, the trial court’s order that the defendant receive no credit for time served since his arrest was proper in view of the court’s action in making the sentences consecutive to the time to be served on the parole revocation, for the time served from defendant’s arrest should properly have been credited toward the parole revocation sentence. Reynolds v. State, 595 P.2d 21 (Alaska 1979).

        Where defendant, while on probation following a sentence for theft, was arrested and charged with misconduct involving a controlled substance, he was entitled to credit for the 13 days he spent in custody between the time he was arrested for the drug offense and the date his probation officer filed a petition to revoke probation.

        In determining if a facility is such so that confinement there warrants credit for time spent in custody,
        
        the court suggests as a point of reference that common characteristics of incarcerative facilities are that their residents are invariably sent there by court order; the facilities require residency, and residency requirements are sufficiently stringent to involve a definite element of confinement; residents of the facilities are subject to 24-hour physical custody or supervision; any periods during which residents may be permitted to leave the facility are expressly limited, both as to time and purpose; while in the facility, residents are under a continuing duty to conform their conduct to institutional rules and to obey orders of persons who have immediate custody over them; and residents are subject to sanctions if they violate institutional rules or orders and to arrest if they leave the facility without permission.

      <p>
       Even assuming that a superior court’s application of subsection (d) somehow amounted to a retroactive application of the statute, denial of defendant’s request that she be awarded credit against her sentence for certain periods was correct. The Alaska Legislature expressly declared that subsection (d) was to apply to all sentences imposed after the statute took effect, even when the defendant’s underlying crime predated the enactment of the statute.

       This section should be interpreted in accordance with its wording, even though it may impose a more restrictive rule than is found in the Nygren v. State line of cases. McKinley v. State, 275 P.3d 567 (Alaska Ct. App. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant received credit for the time he spent on electronic monitoring because at the time defendant violated his bail conditions by drinking alcoholic beverages and illicitly using drugs, the offenses were "violations" of the bail conditions, and not criminal offenses.

       Even if the Department of Law was mistaken in telling the House Judiciary Committee that their proposed statute was simply a codification of the Nygren v. State rule, this does not mean that the court could disregard the wording of the statute and continue to apply the Nygren rule. The debate over the precise wording of subsection (c)(2), demonstrates that the Committee members fully understood the restrictions they were placing on the types of treatment programs that would qualify for sentencing credit. McKinley v. State, 275 P.3d 567 (Alaska Ct. App. 2012).

Therefore, the appellate court did not have to address defendant’s claim. Milazzo v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Nov. 12, 2014) (memorandum decision).

        Electronic monitoring. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was entitled to sentence credit for a period of time spent on electronic monitoring because (1) defendant's electronic monitoring conditions were sufficiently restrictive, and (2) defendant did not commit a new crime during that period. State v. Bell, 421 P.3d 128 (Alaska Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not entitled to sentence credit for a certain electronic monitoring period because defendant committed a new crime at the end of the period, depriving a court of discretion to grant defendant sentence credit for the entire period, whether or not defendant was charged with or convicted of the new crime. State v. Bell, 421 P.3d 128 (Alaska Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       When defendant was placed on electronic monitoring, defendant was not entitled to sentence credit for time spent grocery shopping because (1) this activity was not specified in the statute, and (2) the legislature could validly distinguish between this activity and statutorily specified activities.
       Tanner v. State, 436 P.3d 1061 (Alaska Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       When defendant was placed on electronic monitoring, defendant was not entitled to sentence credit for time spent grocery shopping under the statutory provision for rehabilitative activities because the statute referred to this authorized purpose for leaving home as “attending a rehabilitative activity,” indicating a reference to enrolling in scheduled sessions of counseling or training, rather than leaving home for an unspecified destination and for an unspecified length of time to go shopping for groceries.

      <p>
       Superior court erred in refusing appellant's request for appointed counsel where he had been represented by private counsel at sentencing, he apparently became unable to pay for his private counsel, private counsel was allowed to withdraw when appellant filed his pro se motion for sentencing credit, and there was no inquiry into whether appellant was eligible for appointed counsel.

      <p>
       State must be allowed to litigate whether defendant did, in fact, commit either fourth-degree assault or fourth-degree criminal mischief, or both, during that first period of electronic monitoring release because, while those charges were dismissed as part of a plea bargain, the statute did not speak to a defendant's conviction for a new crime while on electronic monitoring, rather, the statute spoke to a defendant's commission of a new crime.

       Retroactive approval of defendant’s unaccompanied absences from his treatment program as “work-related therapy” and granting defendant credit for a treatment program that did not otherwise comply with the requirements of this section was error.

       While defendant failed to complete two residential treatment programs while on bail release prior to her sentencing, this section awards credit to defendant for each day of successful participation in a court-ordered treatment program that meet the requirements of subsection (c), even though defendant may have ultimately been discharged from the program for misbehavior or noncompliance.

        Treatment programs qualifying for credit. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A treatment program did not qualify for sentencing credit where it allowed unsupervised absences from the facility for any purpose other than court appearances, meetings with counsel, and work required by the treatment program and approved in advance by the court. More liberal case law interpreting the circumstances under which credit was allowed was supplanted by the enactment of this section. McKinley v. State, 275 P.3d 567 (Alaska Ct. App. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       No one asserted that defendant would be eligible for jail time credit for her enrollment in a specific treatment program, and the judge’s comments, which were phrased in the conditional, indicated that the issue of credit was an open question; the record did not support that defendant detrimentally relied on the judge’s comments. Baisch v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Oct. 15, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was defendant’s burden to establish that the residential treatment program he attended qualified for credit, and he failed to meet that burden; the request was denied originally because he failed to show that the program was sufficiently restrictive of his liberty, but he was advised to submit any additional information to the court, which he did not do. Coomes v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Jan. 28, 2015) (memorandum decision).

      </p>
      <p>
       Application for post-conviction relief was denied because appellant failed to show that his attorney was incompetent for advising him that he would receive credit for time spent on private electronic monitoring and for failing to anticipate that the practice would later change; appellant failed to show prejudice because he accepted the plea knowing he could never be placed on electronic monitoring and thus, could never request credit in the first place. .

If the judge wished to order the defendant to pay restitution independent of her conditions of probation, this had to be done at the time she originally imposed sentence. Kelly v.

       Defendant's argument that he was prejudiced by the State's late filing of a restitution request was rejected where even assuming that defendant spent the money in detrimental reliance on the State's failure to file its restitution request by the deadline, he failed to establish that the remedy would have been a reduction in the total restitution owed given that the State's delay was short, the amount of money that defendant spent was relatively small compared to the size of the restitution judgment, the type of restitution ultimately ordered, compensation for medical bills, was readily ascertainable given the injuries the victim suffered from the shooting.

       Defendant's attorney expressly told the court that defendant had not disputed the amounts that the Board had paid to doctors for the victim's medical care, and that no testimony on this point was necessary. As a result, any infirmity in failing to submit the question of restitution to a jury was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in defendant's case.

       If the defendant defaults in the payment of a fine or any installment or of restitution or any installment, the court may order the defendant to show cause why the defendant should not be sentenced to imprisonment for nonpayment and, if the payment was made a condition of the defendant’s probation, may revoke the probation of the defendant. In a contempt or probation revocation proceeding brought as a result of failure to pay a fine or restitution, it is an affirmative defense that the defendant was unable to pay despite having made continuing good faith efforts to pay the fine or restitution. If the court finds that the defendant was unable to pay despite having made continuing good faith efforts, the defendant may not be imprisoned solely because of the inability to pay. If the court does not find that the default was attributable to the defendant’s inability to pay despite having made continuing good faith efforts to pay the fine or restitution, the court may order the defendant imprisoned until the order of the court is satisfied. A term of imprisonment imposed under this section may not exceed one day for each $50 of the unpaid portion of the fine or restitution or one year, whichever is shorter. Credit shall be given toward satisfaction of the order of the court for every day a person is incarcerated for nonpayment of a fine or restitution.

The court may deny the request if it has previously considered the defendant’s ability to pay and the defendant’s request does not allege changed circumstances. If, at a hearing under this subsection, the defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant will be unable through good faith efforts to satisfy the order requiring payment of the fine or restitution, the court shall modify the order so that the defendant can pay the fine or restitution through good faith efforts. The court may reduce the fine ordered, change the payment schedule, or otherwise modify the order. The court may not reduce an order of restitution but may change the payment schedule.

       The court may order a defendant convicted of an offense to perform community work as a condition of probation, a suspended sentence, suspended imposition of sentence, or suspended entry of judgment, or in addition to any fine or restitution ordered. If the defendant is sentenced to imprisonment, the court may recommend to the Department of Corrections that the defendant perform community work.

       Community work includes work on projects designed to reduce or eliminate environmental damage, protect the public health, or improve public lands, forests, parks, roads, highways, facilities, or education.  Community work may not confer a private benefit on a person except as may be incidental to the public benefit.

       The court may offer a defendant convicted of an offense the option of performing community work in lieu of a fine, surcharge, or portion of a fine or surcharge if the court finds the defendant is unable to pay the fine. The value of community work in lieu of a fine is the state’s minimum wage for each hour.

      <li id="t12c55s12.55.055ol1d">
       The court may offer a defendant convicted of an offense the option of performing community work in lieu of a sentence of imprisonment. Substitution of community work shall be at a rate of eight hours for each day of imprisonment. A court may not offer substitution of community work for any mandatory minimum period of imprisonment or for any period within the presumptive range of imprisonment for the offense.

       Medical benefits for an individual injured while performing community work at the direction of the state shall be assumed by the state to the extent not covered by collateral sources.

        Community work replacing jail time altogether. —

      <p>
       Community work cannot properly be relied on to replace jail time altogether when the circumstances surrounding an offender’s conviction for a class B felony, and the consequent need to emphasize community condemnation, would require the imposition of a nonprobationary term.
       In such cases, reliance by the sentencing court on community work to the exclusion of incarceration would unduly depreciate the seriousness of the offense and underemphasize the community’s condemnation of the offender’s misconduct. State v. Jackson, 776 P.2d 320 (Alaska Ct. App. 1989).

       Sentence requiring 1,000 hours of community work, while suspending the entire term of three years’ incarceration imposed upon a 27 year-old gym teacher convicted of sexually abusing a 14 year-old female student, was disapproved, where the sentence unduly depreciated the significance of his misconduct and inadequately served the sentencing goal of community condemnation.

        Because the rule of lenity must prevail where legislative intent is ambiguous, and because it could not be said with certainty that the legislature intended to bar courts from imposing a suspended sentence for convictions of conspiracy, the appellate court ruled that this section did not preclude a court from granting a suspended sentence to persons convicted of conspiracy to commit one of the listed crimes.

        Since there was no logical way that the trial court could cause the period of suspension to begin several years in the future, i.e., at the end of the six-year term for forgery, and the period of suspension and probationary term had to begin when the trial court’s order was entered, the supreme court held that what the judgment meant was that the imposition of sentence on the charge of uttering a check with insufficient funds was suspended, and defendant placed on probation, from the date of its entry until five years after the defendant’s six-year term of imprisonment expired.

       <p>
        The inherent authority of courts to expunge criminal records did not extend to a defendant who received a suspended sentence and had his conviction set aside after he completed probation, but who never established his factual innocence nor challenged the conviction or the underlying arrest; nor is there authority to expunge a charge which was dismissed because the state obtained evidence in violation of a warrant, since neither the validity of the substantive information nor fundamental fairness was implicated. Journey v. State, 850 P.2d 663 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993), aff'd, 895 P.2d 955 (Alaska 1995).

       <p>
        Expunction of a defendant’s criminal record is not authorized under the set-aside provisions of subsection (e). The district court lacked statutory authority to order the criminal record expunged upon “discharge by the court without imposition of sentence” and the subsequent setting aside of his conviction.

        The set-aside provisions of this section “require a substantial showing of rehabilitation,” within the meaning of Alaska Rule of Evidence 609 (d)(2).

        Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to set aside his prior convictions because, although defendant’s three-year probationary term had passed, defendant had made no effort to contact the Department of Corrections or to fulfill his obligations; therefore, defendant did not successfully complete his probation.

        When defendant appealed a conviction, staying defendant's probation, but a trial court erroneously believed defendant continued on probation during the appeal, and, as a result, issued an erroneous order discharging defendant from probation and setting aside defendant's conviction, double jeopardy did not bar the court from correcting the court's mistake because jeopardy did not attach to the court's plainly erroneous discharge and set-aside order.

        An appropriate construction of the segment of this statute which provides “if a crime is punishable by both fine and imprisonment the court may impose a fine and place the defendant on probation as to imprisonment” is that it authorizes the trial court to impose a fine as a separate punishment in addition to probation where the penalty provision of the violated criminal statute provides for both fine and imprisonment.
        Any fine meted out as a sanction by the trial court in such circumstances would be subject to the fine limitation prescribed under the penalty section of the statute involved. Brown v. State, 559 P.2d 107 (Alaska 1977).

        Neither the plain language nor the legislative history of this section suggest room for a legal presumption limiting a sentencing court’s power to restrict discretionary parole eligibility beyond one-third of the prisoner’s actual term, nor does it suggest sentencing courts are to limit this power out of deference to the parole board.

         Making flawed probation condition more onerous. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the sentencing court failed to specify, pursuant to subsection (c), the maximum length of time that the defendant was to spend in residential treatment for her alcohol problem as a condition of her probation, the judge’s subsequent order setting the maximum length of residential treatment at 90 days constituted an increase in the defendant’s sentence violating the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. An illegal sentence should not be increased unless absolutely necessary to correct the illegality. In this case the illegality should have been corrected by striking the flawed portion of the probation order, i.e., the requirement of residential treatment. Christensen v. State, 844 P.2d 557 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        A court may modify probation to the defendant’s detriment without violating the double jeopardy clause when the applicable statutes authorize the modification, as they do when the court finds that the defendant has violated probation; but, once sentence is meaningfully imposed, a sentencing court does not have the power to alter probation to the defendant’s detriment simply because the court comes to believe that a longer probationary term or more onerous conditions of probation would be better. Reyes v. State, 978 P.2d 635 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).

        Under subsection (a)(5), sentencing court had authority to order probationer to participate in sex offender treatment with a therapist that was not on the department of corrections’ approved list of therapy providers over the department’s objection.

        Condition of probation that required defendant to actively participate in Alaska Department of Corrections-approved treatment as directed by the probation office was not illegal on the basis that it failed to set a maximum term for required residential treatment because the condition did not authorize residential treatment.

        Condition of probation that required defendant to actively participate in Alaska Department of Corrections-approved treatment as directed by the probation office was not obviously vague or overbroad and was, therefore, not plainly erroneous because defendant's probation officer could not require defendant to participate in a treatment program unless the program was related to his offense or to his rehabilitation.

        Superior court erred in revoking defendant's probation and adding new conditions of probation because the superior court never reached the factual merits of the defense attorney's contention that defendant was terminated from a sex offender treatment program without good reason—the director of the program discharged defendant from the program for reasons that were either demonstrably wrong or, at best, were supported only by vague and unspecific assertions that defendant had failed to "engage"—failed to offer any plausible basis for rejecting defendant's request that he be allowed to socialize with his romantic partner and the mother of his children, and illegally increased defendant's sentence by ordering him to enroll in domestic violence treatment even though his case apparently presented no issue of violence.

       If the petitioner were to be charged only with a violation of his probation or the commission of an act which would be a violation of the conditions under which his sentence was suspended, he should then be given notice of a hearing to be held to determine the truth or falsity of the alleged violation of the conditions of his suspended sentence and be given an opportunity to procure counsel to represent him.

      <p>
       Summary hearings upon the revocation of a suspended sentence have been upheld. What is required in such hearings is the exercise of conscientious judgment, and not arbitrary action; that the discretion of the court has not been abused; and that the facts revealed at the hearing satisfy the court that the modification or revocation of the sentence, or a part thereof, will serve the ends of justice.

      <p>
       The requirement that probation revocation follow after a showing of “good cause” requires the trial judge to find that continuation of probationary status would be at odds with the need to protect society and society’s interest in the probationer’s rehabilitation.

      </p>
      <p>
       Revocation of defendant's probation for good cause was appropriate because he failed to attend a polygraph appointment with a probation officer. Defendant had notice of the appointment and the obligation to attend the appointment, he had a pattern of noncompliance with and resistance to the rehabilitative aspects of probation, and his failure to commit to his responsibilities as a sex offender on probation and failure to actively engage in the rehabilitative process made defendant dangerous to the community.

       Where defendant was serving probation for sexual abuse of a minor, the trial court found good cause to revoke his probation because he was discharged from the sex offender treatment program and his treatment provider testified that defendant demonstrated a lack of accountability by denying that the incident had occurred.

       Court of Appeals of the State of Alaska did not apply the proper two-stage probation revocation hearing process; the court should have made a finding of fact regarding whether the probationer violated a condition of probation, and, if the probationer did violate a condition of probation, the court then should have determined the proper disposition given the violation. The probationer's mental state at the time of the violation as well as at the time of the revocation hearing and a good cause determination were part of the second stage.

        Presumption that questions of discretionary release are better left to parole board is rebuttable. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the legislature has affirmatively given sentencing judges the power to restrict or deny parole eligibility, the presumption that the parole eligibility of defendants sentenced to lengthy prison terms should normally be evaluated after the defendant has established an institutional history and not at sentencing must remain rebuttable. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in restricting the defendant’s parole through the entire 99-year term he was given for commiting first degree murder where the record established that he had minimal potential for rehabilitation.

      <p>
       Imposition of a 40-year restriction on defendant’s eligibility for discretionary parole after he was convicted of extreme-indifference second-degree murder was improper under this section because he would have normally been eligible for discretionary parole after serving one-third of his 70-year term, and superior court did not explain why the normal parole restriction was inadequate to protect the public or ensure defendant’s rehabilitation.

       Trial court’s order that defendant’s eligibility for discretionary parole be restricted until he had served at least 50 years of his sentence was reversed as excessive because defendant was ineligible for parole for 33 years, when he would be 67 years old. The trial court’s decision to additionally restrict defendant’s eligibility for discretionary parole was based on predictions that defendant would be dangerous to the public and might constitute a danger to his then middle-aged children and their children which was a speculative possibility at best. Korkow v. State, 258 P.3d 932 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011), rev'd, 314 P.3d 560 (Alaska 2013).

       Superior court’s restriction on defendant’s parole eligibility was not clearly mistaken because his plea agreement left the terms of the sentence to the court, he did not seek to rescind the agreement on the basis that the restriction was outside its scope, and the superior court considered the statutory factors as they related to defendant’s dangerousness, community condemnation, general and specific deterrence, and that, without the restriction, the sentence would be too lenient.

       It was necessary to remand defendant’s case to the trial court so that it could reconsider whether defendant’s eligibility for parole should be restricted.

       Denial of parole eligibility for defendant, who received a 99-year sentence after being convicted of murder, was not clearly mistaken, where the record showed him to be a racist, a man full of anger, a man with a severe alcohol problem, and a man with a proclivity for assaulting people with firearms, and showed that he had just been released on felony probation a few days before the murder. Stern v. State, 827 P.2d 442 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).

       Defendant’s history of prior assaultive conduct, particularly his sexually assaultive conduct, which escalated to the offense for which he was being sentenced, supported that sentence which required him to spend the rest of his life in prison without any possibility of parole. Alexander v. State, 838 P.2d 269 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s discretionary parole eligibility was properly restricted until he served 50 years of imprisonment where the trial court decided that defendant should be incarcerated until he was no longer physically able to hurt people. Defendant had 10 prior convictions, including two felonies and two assaults.
       Nichols v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Nov. 19, 2008) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant was convicted of second-degree murder and kidnapping, the trial court’s decision to restrict defendant’s eligibility to apply for discretionary parole until he had served 30 years of his sentence was not clearly mistaken where the trial court found there was a need to protect the public, where the defendant’s prior offenses, though misdemeanors, were numerous and serious, where defendant was a cocaine dealer, and where defendant had committed fourteen infractions while in jail awaiting trial.
       Page v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Sept. 22, 2010) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly concluded that defendant was not eligible for discretionary parole because he was in his mid-forties when he committed the murder for which he was on trial, committed a number of serious assaultive crimes since he was a teenager, and showed little prospect of rehabilitation. Adams v. State, 390 P.3d 1194 (Alaska Ct. App. 2017), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 138 S. Ct. 2610, 201 L. Ed. 2d 1011 (U.S. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sentencing court's restriction on defendant's eligibility for discretionary parole was upheld because the sentencing court specifically explained that it had chosen to restrict defendant's discretionary parole because of the need for isolation and community condemnation, and its reasons for doing so, namely, the violent and callous circumstances of the current offense, defendant's past and continued assaultive behavior, and his past failures on supervision, were supported by substantial evidence in the record.

       A sentence of imprisonment lawfully imposed by the superior court for a term or for aggregate terms exceeding two years of unsuspended incarceration for a felony offense or exceeding 120 days for a misdemeanor offense may be appealed to the court of appeals by the defendant on the ground that the sentence is excessive, unless the sentence was imposed in accordance with a plea agreement under the applicable Alaska Rules of Criminal Procedure and that agreement provided for imposition of a specific sentence or a sentence equal to or less than a specified maximum sentence. If the superior court imposed a sentence in accordance with a plea agreement that provided for a minimum sentence, the defendant may appeal only that portion of the sentence that exceeds the minimum sentence provided for in the plea agreement and that exceeds two years of unsuspended incarceration for a felony offense or 120 days of unsuspended incarceration for a misdemeanor offense. By appealing a sentence under this section, the defendant waives the right to plead that by a revision of the sentence resulting from the appeal the defendant has been twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense.

       </p>
       <p>
        Many of the cases cited below refer to the supreme court, which prior to 1980 was the court hearing sentence appeals. In 1980, this section was amended to provide for sentence review by the court of appeals rather than the supreme court.

         Constitutionality. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Retroactive application of the sentence appeal restrictions added by the 1995 amendment of this section does not violate the ex post facto clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Amin v. State, 939 P.2d 413 (Alaska Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provision limiting the right of sentence appeal of a defendant sentenced to less than two years to serve does not affect the inherent authority of the judiciary to review sentences nor violate equal protection or due process under the constitution. Rozkydal v. State, 938 P.2d 1091 (Alaska Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff’s claims for damages against governmental defendants for failing to challenge the constitutionality of 1995 legislation that modified jurisdiction regarding excessive sentence appeals were precluded by collateral estoppel. A ruling that plaintiff was not injured by the 1995 legislation barred plaintiff from further lawsuits based on harm arising from the alleged unconstitutionality of the legislation. Latham v. Palin, 251 P.3d 341 (Alaska), cert. denied, 565 U.S. 885, 132 S. Ct. 257, 181 L. Ed. 2d 150 (U.S. 2011).

         Legislative awareness of deficiencies in sentencing practices. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The sentence appeal statute manifests the legislature’s awareness of existing deficiencies in sentencing practices throughout Alaska’s entire court system and the compelling necessity of developing appropriate sentencing criteria. State v. Chaney, 477 P.2d 441 (Alaska 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The primary goal of a sentence appeal statute
        </b>
        is an attempt to implement Alaska’s constitutional mandate that “Penal administration shall be based on the principle of reformation and upon the need for protecting the public.” State v. Chaney, 477 P.2d 441 (Alaska 1970); Perrin v. State, 543 P.2d 413 (Alaska 1975).

         Trial court authority to set bail for convicted defendant appealing only sentence. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The only statute relevant to the question of whether a trial court has the authority to admit to bail a convicted defendant who is appealing his sentence, but not his conviction, is subsection (c) of this section, which neither grants nor denies the right to bail pending appeal; thus, there exists no basis for concluding that the legislature intended to limit the inherent authority of the court. State v. Dobrova, 694 P.2d 157 (Alaska 1985).

       <p>
        Because the propriety of defendant’s composite sentence had to be assessed in light of the totality of his conduct and background, the appellate court concluded that it should not review defendant’s misdemeanor sentence when it had no jurisdiction to review the accompanying felony sentence. Richards v. State, 249 P.3d 303 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011).
       </p>

        , the appellate court had no authority to declare that defendant’s case should be referred to a three-judge panel on the ground that even a sentence of forty-five years to serve was clearly mistaken; the appellate court had no authority to declare that such a sentence was not clearly mistaken, and that the trial judge therefore committed no error when he failed to refer defendant’s case to the three-judge panel.

       </p>
       <p>
        Under Alaska’s constitution, the principles of reformation and necessity of protecting the public constitute the touchstones of penal administration.
        Multiple goals encompassed within these broad constitutional standards include rehabilitation of the offender into a noncriminal member of society, isolation of the offender from society to prevent criminal conduct during the period of confinement, deterrence of the offender himself after his release from confinement or other penological treatment, as well as deterrence of other members of the community who might possess tendencies toward criminal conduct similar to that of the offender, and community condemnation of the individual offender, or, in other words, reaffirmation of societal norms for the purpose of maintaining respect for the norms themselves. State v. Chaney, 477 P.2d 441 (Alaska 1970); Perrin v. State, 543 P.2d 413 (Alaska 1975); Cleary v. State, 548 P.2d 952 (Alaska 1976); Deveroux v. State, 548 P.2d 1296 (Alaska 1976); Layland v.

        The judiciary of Alaska and that section of the executive branch which administers the penal system (i.e., the division of corrections and the Department of Health and Social Services), are constrained by the Alaska Constitution to base penal administration “on the principle of reformation and upon the need for protecting the public.” Bordewick v. State, 569 P.2d 184 (Alaska 1977); Ripley v. State, 590 P.2d 48 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The twin goals of sentencing are reformation of the offender and protection of the public.
        Both should be considered equally and punishment should not be emphasized to the exclusion of rehabilitation potential. Good v. State, 590 P.2d 420 (Alaska 1979).

         State v. Chaney
        </i>
        , 477 P.2d 441 (Alaska 1970), the supreme court has identified four sentencing goals: Rehabilitation of the offender, isolation of the offender from society, deterrence of the offender after his release and of others disposed to commit similar acts, and community condemnation of the offender because of his acts. Post v. State, 580 P.2d 304 (Alaska 1978); State v. Tucker, 581 P.2d 223 (Alaska 1978); Shagloak v. State, 582 P.2d 1034 (Alaska 1978), vacated, 597 P.2d 142 (Alaska 1979); Rice v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Appropriate goals of sentencing are deterrence of the offender and of other members of the community who might possess similar criminal tendencies and reaffirmation of societal norms. State v. Abraham, 566 P.2d 267 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Deterrence of borderline criminals is an essential purpose of sentencing. Zurfluh v. State, 620 P.2d 690 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Important goals of sentencing to be considered are isolation of the offender from society to prevent criminal conduct, future deterrence of the offender himself, deterrence of other members of the community, and community condemnation of the individual offender, or in other words, reaffirmation of societal norms for the purpose of maintaining respect for the norms themselves. Brandon v. State, 581 P.2d 1116 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        When sentencing an individual for a crime such as arson committed with intent to defraud, which is a calculated act, the objectives of deterring others and reaffirming community condemnation deserve special consideration. Putnam v. State, 629 P.2d 35 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        In regard to the purposes of sentencing, one of the goals to be achieved is rehabilitation of the convicted offender into a noncriminal member of society. Collins v. State, 574 P.2d 1278 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentencing goals include rehabilitation and the protection of society, and the sentencing court can reflect the community’s condemnation of certain crimes in imposing sentence. Griffith v. State, 578 P.2d 578 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The possibility of rehabilitation must be considered in every case.
        However, it need not be given the highest priority as a sentencing goal in all cases.
        The Alaska Constitution places equal emphasis upon protection of the public. Nelson v. State, 619 P.2d 480 (Alaska Ct. App. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        In any case involving loss of life, and particularly in an offense involving driving while under the influence of alcohol, major considerations are the goals of deterrence of our members of the community and community condemnation of the offender and the offense so as to reaffirm societal norms and to maintain respect for those norms. Rosendahl v. State, 591 P.2d 538 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The goal of rehabilitation is a touchstone of penal administration and is mandated by Alaska Const., art. I, § 12. Shagloak v. State, 582 P.2d 1034 (Alaska 1978), vacated, 597 P.2d 142 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The twin goals of penal administration in Alaska, reformation of the offender and the need to protect the public, would be best served by a sentence that accommodates treatment as well as protects society and reaffirms the societal norms. Hansen v. State, 582 P.2d 1041 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court has repeatedly required the sentencing judge to consider, on the record, various goals or objectives to be achieved in sentencing, including among other factors, the reformation or rehabilitation of the offender. Abraham v. State, 585 P.2d 526 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The goal of rehabilitation should be a primary consideration in fashioning a sentence where psychiatric problems, rather than a general criminal intent, lie at the root of criminal behavior. Ferreira v. State, 602 P.2d 803 (Alaska 1979).

        In sentencing, Alaska judges must consider both the possibility of the defendant’s reformation and the need for protection of the public. Egelak v. State, 438 P.2d 712 (Alaska 1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate court held that a composite sentence of 20 years, which consisted of consecutive sentences for 12 crimes committed within a two-month period, was not excessive because defendant had a lengthy history of convictions and unavailing attempts to supervise and rehabilitate and because the record supported a judge’s determination that the defendant was a dangerous and impulsive offender who could not be reformed or deterred.

        Where the trial court’s written judgment did not legally restrict defendant’s parole, did not specifically provide that defendant would be eligible for parole after serving the mandatory minimum period of time required by statute, and took into consideration defendant’s prior favorable record, but considered his prospects for rehabilitation to be guarded because of the serious nature of the offense and defendant’s failure to accept full responsibility for the crime, and also emphasized the need to deter similar offenses, such reasons were sufficient to justify the recommendation.

        A sentencing judge may take into account his belief that the defendant committed perjury at his trial, but the judge may do so only to the extent that the alleged perjury is used by him as indicia to determine the defendant’s potential for rehabilitation; thus it is improper to enhance the sentence as punishment for the alleged perjury. Pyrdol v. State, 617 P.2d 513 (Alaska 1980); Coleman v. State, 621 P.2d 869 (Alaska 1980), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1090, 102 S. Ct. 653, 70 L. Ed. 2d 628 (U.S. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        While a sentencing judge may take into account his belief that the defendant committed perjury at trial, the sentence which is imposed must be for the underlying offense, not for perjury.
        To automatically enhance a sentence as a sanction because of the judge’s belief that perjury was committed is improper.

       </p>
       <p>
        Although the most recent of the psychiatric evaluations which the court had before it was two years old at the time of sentencing, in view of the nature of the offense (burglary not in a dwelling) and the reports available to the judge, it was not error to have requested an additional examination.

        In sentencing, it is appropriate to consider an insanity acquittal as it bears on the chances of a recurrence, the threat to society posed by the offender, and the prospects for reformation.
        Nevertheless, although it would not be proper to ignore an insanity acquittal altogether simply because it does not demonstrate a criminal state of mind, it would be inappropriate to view such an incident as equivalent to a guilty verdict, since the offender’s mental state is significantly different.

       </p>
       <p>
        The worst offender characterization may be based on the particular manner of committing the offense, the background of the offender, or both.

Chaney, 477 P.2d 441 (Alaska 1970), criteria, on the assumption that the entire term may be served; then the court may, in its discretion, designate a parole eligibility period greater than the statutory minimum and should articulate on the record its reasons for doing so.

         Drug offenses. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court has recommended that judges consider four categories of drug offenses when making sentencing determinations.
        These four classes are arranged in descending order of gravity: (1) Smuggling or sale of large quantities of narcotics or possession of large quantities for sale; (2) smuggling or sale of small quantities of narcotics or possession of small quantities for sale; (3) possession of narcotics without intent to sell and (4) marijuana offenses. Salazar v. State, 562 P.2d 694 (Alaska 1977); Huff v. State, 568 P.2d 1014 (Alaska 1977); Johnson v. State, 577 P.2d 230 (Alaska 1978); Davis v. State, 577 P.2d 690 (Alaska 1978); Moreau v. State, 588 P.2d 275 (Alaska 1978); Wharton v. State, 590 P.2d 427 (Alaska 1979); Elliott v. State, 590 P.2d 881 (Alaska 1979); Sanders v. State, 602 P.2d 1252 (Alaska 1979); Strachan v. State, 615 P.2d 611 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Large scale operations where sales of drugs are made in substantial amounts would call for more severe punishment than sales of small or moderate amounts of drugs.
        The latter, in turn, is generally punishable by greater penalties than the instances where one possesses narcotics for his own use and without intent to sell. Huff v. State, 568 P.2d 1014 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ranking the seriousness of drug offenses does not create, de facto, a descending order of maximum sentences within each class.
        The size of the sale and the drug involved must be considered with other factors; and, other things being equal, the gravity of a drug offense should affect sentence length. Strachan v. State, 615 P.2d 611 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The sentencing court is not required to classify a drug offender solely on the basis of the facts underlying the particular offense leading to his conviction. Mangold v. State, 613 P.2d 272 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        A determination of what degree of punishment should be given for a drug offense depends on the gravity of the offense. Huff v. State, 568 P.2d 1014 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        As long as the legislature acts within constitutional bounds, it is not the function of the supreme court to determine whether the state’s response to the use of narcotic drugs is best suited to solving the societal problems created by the illness of addiction. Roman v. State, 570 P.2d 1235 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Given defendant’s admission that, in addition to the sale for which he was convicted, he later sold police officers a quarter pound of cocaine for approximately $8,000, the superior court was entitled to classify him as coming within the most serious category of drug offenders. Mangold v. State, 613 P.2d 272 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        An examination of sentences imposed on drug offenders in Alaska reveals that 10 years is quite a severe sentence for any type of drug offense. Salazar v. State, 562 P.2d 694 (Alaska 1977); Huff v. State, 568 P.2d 1014 (Alaska 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although anyone convicted of unlawful sale of a drug may be subjected to a jail sentence, the supreme court does not agree that it’s necessary that jail time be imposed upon people who sell cocaine.
        Such a statement is overbroad and fails to give adequate consideration to the specific characteristics of individual offenders and offenses. Elliott v. State, 590 P.2d 881 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>

       </p>
       <p>
        In sentencing, it should be remembered that the maximum sentence for a particular offense expresses a legislative judgment about how the worst offender within a class designated by the legislature should be treated. Galaktionoff v. State, 486 P.2d 919 (Alaska 1971); Sielak v. State, 581 P.2d 226 (Alaska 1978); Tuckfield v. State, 621 P.2d 1350 (Alaska 1981).

        A maximum prison sentence should not be imposed unless the defendant being sentenced fits into a class which the supreme court has characterized as “the worst type of offender.” Bordewick v.

        Maximum prison terms ought not to exceed five years except for cases involving particularly serious crimes. State v. Trunnel, 549 P.2d 550 (Alaska 1976); Salazar v.

        The fact that a serious offense has been committed does not, per se, place the defendant in the category of the worst offender for that crime; rather, the relevant category is worst offender within the group of those persons committing the offense in question, and that characterization may be based on the particular manner of committing the offense, the background of the offender, or both.

        Some of the factors which the supreme court has looked to in order to support a characterization of defendant as the worst type of offender — and the imposition of a maximum term — have been prior criminal convictions, age, military records, employment history, drug or alcohol addiction, presentence report evaluations and recommendations and behavior which has been considered to demonstrate an antisocial nature or dangerous propensities which pose a clear risk to the public. State v. Wortham, 537 P.2d 1117 (Alaska 1975); Bordewick v. State, 569 P.2d 184 (Alaska 1977); Clark v. State, 574 P.2d 1261 (Alaska 1978); United States v. Lincoln, 581 F.2d 200 (9th Cir. Alaska 1978); Wilson v. State, 582 P.2d 154 (Alaska 1978); Hansen v. State, 582 P.2d 1041 (Alaska 1978); Morris v. State, 592 P.2d 1244 (Alaska 1979); Bell v.

        Two of the factors to be considered in characterizing a defendant as a “worst type of offender” are (1) prior criminal convictions and (2) behavior which has been considered to demonstrate an antisocial nature or dangerous propensities which pose a clear risk to the public. Tommy v. State, 551 P.2d 179 (Alaska 1976).

        Some of the factors relied upon to support a characterization as the worst type of offender include prior criminal convictions, age, employment history, alcohol addiction, presentence report evaluations and behavior which has been considered to demonstrate an antisocial nature or dangerous propensities which pose a clear risk to the public. Noble v. State, 552 P.2d 142 (Alaska 1976); Sielak v. State, 581 P.2d 226 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        In most cases, worst offender characterization will involve factors intrinsic and extrinsic to the particular offense. However, a person may be characterized as a worst offender based solely on elements intrinsic to the particular crime for which the defendant is being sentenced, or based solely on elements extrinsic to the particular crime. Saganna v. State, 594 P.2d 69 (Alaska 1979).

       <p>
        Although the legislature conferred on convicted defendants a limited right of appeal of sentences, in the exercise of the supreme court’s inherent and statutory jurisdiction to entertain appeals, the court has expanded that right by means of Rules of Appellate Procedure.

         Sentence for less than two years. —

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s appeal was dismissed where he did not receive a sentence of more than 2 years to serve, because in 1995, the legislature limited felony offenders’ right of sentence appeal by amending subsection (a) to state that felony offenders could appeal their sentences only if they received a term, or aggregate terms, exceeding two years of unsuspended incarceration. Hunt v. State, 18 P.3d 69 (Alaska Ct. App. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant sentenced to less than two years to serve has no right to appeal the sentence, but is entitled to petition the supreme court for review of the sentence under Appellate Rule 215. Rozkydal v. State, 938 P.2d 1091 (Alaska Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant's sentence did not exceed two years of imprisonment, she did not have the right to appeal her sentence as excessive to the Court of Appeals of Alaska, and the Court of Appeals did not have jurisdiction to consider her excessive sentence claim. Defendant was required instead to petition the Alaska Supreme Court for discretionary sentence review.

This section does not limit the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals because defendant was challenging a probation condition and not the term of her imprisonment; the probation condition prohibiting her from possessing animals was upheld as reasonably related to her rehabilitation.

        Appellate court had jurisdiction to hear an argument that a 5-year term of probation was excessive in a criminal contempt case because the bar against excessive sentence appeals involving misdemeanor sentences of less than 120 days did not apply to non-term-of imprisonment sentence appeals. The probationary term was not excessive because it did not unduly restrict defendant's liberty; the sentencing judge concluded that the term was necessary to change defendant's attitudes that led to his refusal to pay child support, to deter others from similar conduct, and to affirm community values.

        It is the duty of the supreme court to examine the proceedings below to review, for excessiveness or leniency, the sentence imposed by the trial court, in light of the nature of the crime, the defendant’s character, and the need for protecting the public.
        It is also obliged to consider the manner in which the sentence was imposed, including the sufficiency and accuracy of the information upon which it was based. State v. Chaney, 477 P.2d 441 (Alaska 1970); Nukapigak v. State, 562 P.2d 697 (Alaska 1977); Ferguson v. State, 590 P.2d 43 (Alaska 1979); Ripley v. State, 590 P.2d 48 (Alaska 1979).

        In determining whether any particular sentence is excessive or too lenient, the supreme court will consider the proceedings below in light of the nature of the crime, the defendant’s character and the need for protecting the public. State v. Wortham, 537 P.2d 1117 (Alaska 1975); Noble v. State, 552 P.2d 142 (Alaska 1976); State v. Abraham, 566 P.2d 267 (Alaska 1977); Walton v. State, 568 P.2d 981 (Alaska 1977); Fox v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The scope of appellate review requires that the supreme court make its own examination of the record, focusing on the nature of the crime, the defendant’s character and the need for protecting the public.

       <p>
        In determining whether a sentence is excessive, the supreme court must make an independent examination of the record. Noble v. State, 552 P.2d 142 (Alaska 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Comparison with other sentences is not determinative of the merits of a particular sentence appeal. Creer v. State, 600 P.2d 1095 (Alaska 1979); Strachan v. State, 615 P.2d 611 (Alaska 1980); Kagak v. State, 624 P.2d 818 (Alaska 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In reviewing a criminal sentence, part of the court’s obligation is to consider the sufficiency and accuracy of the information upon which the sentence is based. Walton v. State, 568 P.2d 981 (Alaska 1977); Franzen v. State, 573 P.2d 55 (Alaska 1978); Edinger v. State, 598 P.2d 943 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The scope of appellate review requires that the supreme court make its own examination of the record. Such an independent examination of the justice of a particular sentence is necessary in order for the review process to function effectively. Hansen v. State, 582 P.2d 1041 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Respect for the discretion of the trial judge should not prevent the reviewing court from making its own inquiry into the justice of the sentence before it.
        Having made that inquiry, the reviewing court should not “tinker” with the sentence.
        However, an independent examination of the justice of the particular sentence is necessary in order for the review process to properly function. State v. Chaney, 477 P.2d 441 (Alaska 1970).

         The fair approach in reviewing sentences

        is to treat the case as presenting only the crime of which the defendant has been convicted.

       </p>
       <p>
        In light of the importance of rehabilitation in the sentencing process, the court will affirm sentences which disregard rehabilitation as an alternative only where sufficiently articulated reasons are given for that decision or where these reasons appear clear on the face of the sentencing proceedings. Shagloak v. State, 582 P.2d 1034 (Alaska 1978), vacated, 597 P.2d 142 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        While rehabilitation is certainly one of the primary goals of sentencing, a court is not required to fashion a sentence to provide for rehabilitation if it finds that the potential for rehabilitation is nonexistent within the time constraints of the penalty for a particular offense. Bell v. State, 598 P.2d 908 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the circumstances justify the sentencing court’s de-emphasis of the goal of rehabilitation because that possibility is minimal or outweighed by other factors, the supreme court will not find an abuse of discretion on the sentencing court’s part if it then imposes a sentence which is designed to advance other appropriate sentencing objectives. Shelton v. State, 611 P.2d 24 (Alaska 1980).

       <p>
        Where the sentencing judge concluded that the goal of rehabilitation and that of protection of the public from dangerous offenders were in conflict after reviewing a rape defendant’s record, psychiatric reports, and available rehabilitative programs, and given the seriousness of the crimes of which the defendant was convicted and his demonstrated extreme tendency towards recidivism, it was not an abuse of discretion that the trial court de-emphasized the goal of rehabilitation in relation to the other factors to be considered in sentencing. Coleman v. State, 621 P.2d 869 (Alaska 1980), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1090, 102 S. Ct. 653, 70 L. Ed. 2d 628 (U.S. 1981).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in its sentencing remarks, the superior court discussed the need to deter future misconduct on the part of defendant after his return to society, the need to deter others inclined to drive while drinking, and the necessity for a sentence that would reflect society’s strong condemnation of those individuals who take innocent lives by driving while intoxicated, but it is also plainly recognized that it was required to consider the question of the defendant’s rehabilitation, noting only that that was “not the sole matter” to be considered, the court clearly considered the criteria established in State v.

        where defense counsel merely cited a study by the Alaska Judicial Council, that blacks convicted of burglary, larceny, and receiving stolen property tend to receive significantly higher sentences than persons of other races, without giving any indication that defendant’s sentence was probably higher than that which would have been imposed upon a defendant of a different race with a like criminal history who committed a similar offense. Campbell v. State, 594 P.2d 65 (Alaska 1979); Bell v. State, 598 P.2d 908 (Alaska 1979); Preston v. State, 615 P.2d 594 (Alaska 1980).

        In determining whether a given sentence is excessive or overly lenient, the supreme court will consider the total sentence entered including any period of suspension or deferred imposition. Andrews v. State, 552 P.2d 150 (Alaska 1976); Nattrass v. State, 554 P.2d 399 (Alaska 1976); Zurfluh v. State, 620 P.2d 690 (Alaska 1980); Pascoe v. State, 628 P.2d 547 (Alaska 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        For sentence review purposes, the supreme court must consider the entire sentence imposed without regard to possible parole date. Hansen v. State, 582 P.2d 1041 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although generally the supreme court would not assess the combined length of two separately imposed consecutive sentences, when both sentences had been separately appealed to that court, it was appropriate to consider the overall length of the combined sentences in one appeal. Neal v. State, 628 P.2d 19 (Alaska 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        While suspension of a portion of the term eliminates the requirement of a worse offender analysis, the entire length of the sentence must be assessed without the regard to the suspension to determine whether it is excessive. Ferreira v. State, 602 P.2d 803 (Alaska 1979).

        Supreme court reviewed a sentence where defendant’s sole contention was that the superior court erred in considering certain information appearing in his presentence report and made no direct claim that the sentence was excessive. Franzen v. State, 573 P.2d 55 (Alaska 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although excessiveness is the only statutory ground for a sentence appeal by the defendant, the reviewing court has previously considered whether the trial court relied on impermissible factors. Schmid v. State, 615 P.2d 565 (Alaska 1980).

       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court will not automatically reverse a sentence because a drug addict is not placed in a drug rehabilitation program. Daniels v. State, 584 P.2d 47 (Alaska 1978); Good v. State, 590 P.2d 420 (Alaska 1979).
       </p>

       <p>
        Although sentences imposed on defendant, a heroin addict, were not excessive, the case was remanded with directions to enter an amended judgment which included a recommendation to the division of corrections that defendant receive treatment for his drug addition as the division of corrections may find advisable.

        Defendant was entitled to resentencing because (1) a trial court's exercise of discretionary resentencing authority, when the case was remanded to determine whether the court had sentenced defendant with a correct understanding of consecutive sentencing laws, triggered reduced sentencing provisions enacted after the resentencing hearing but before a decision was issued, and (2) the composite sentence exceeded that authorized by the new provisions.

        It is within the legislature’s prerogative to determine appropriate sentences, and the availability of parole either at the direction of an agency in the executive branch or at the direction of a judicial officer is not necessary to make presumptive or minimum sentences constitutional.

       <p>
        An underlying assumption about the presumptive sentencing ranges in this section is that the legislature intended for these presumptive ranges to quantify, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the sentences that should be imposed on defendants who have committed a typical offense within the statutory definition of a crime, and who have typical prospects for rehabilitation. A further assumption is that a defendant’s criminal history is adequately reflected by the defendant’s status as a first, second, or third felony offender. Collins v. State, 287 P.3d 791 (Alaska Ct. App. 2012).

        While it is desirable for similarly situated defendants to receive similar treatment, as a practical matter, sentencing is an individualized process and a certain amount of disparity will result from the exercise of judicial discretion. Smith v. State, 739 P.2d 1306 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).

       <p>
        Given defendant’s two underlying felony offenses, his lengthy list of other offenses, and his repeated failures to cope with his alcohol problem during his felony probation, the judge was not clearly mistaken when he imposed half of defendant’s remaining suspended time — 3 years, 5 months — out of a potential 6 years, 10 months. Custer v. State, 88 P.3d 545 (Alaska Ct. App. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the offense for which defendant was convicted was not as serious as some of his prior offenses, the existence of multiple aggravating factors and his status as a three-time felon justified the sentence imposed by the trial court. Mooney v. State, 105 P.3d 149 (Alaska Ct. App. 2005).

       <p>
        Where defendant was convicted of murder in the second degree, his sentence of 85 years was not excessive even though his co-defendants received lighter sentences; the sentencing judge found that defendant was the primary actor, he acted with deliberate cruelty, tortured the victim, and had an extensive prior criminal record. His co-defendants did not have a similar criminal history, and received leniency for agreeing to accept responsibility and to testify.

       <p>
        Except in cases of unclassified felonies, the appellate courts of Alaska have consistently followed the ABA Standards’ recommended 10-year benchmark for all but serious offenses committed by particularly dangerous offenders, and only in rare cases would a sentence in excess of 10 years be justified by any sentencing goal other than the need to isolate the defendant in order to protect the community. Williams v. State, 759 P.2d 575 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).

        The facts of defendant’s current offense, his lengthy criminal record, and his previous attempt to kidnap and rape another woman all supported the judge’s conclusion that defendant’s case was unusually aggravated and that defendant should receive a sentence significantly above the 20- to 30-year benchmark ranges.

       <p>
        A “worst offender” designation, standing alone, permits imposition of the maximum term for the single most serious offense.
        The designation does not, however, automatically permit consecutive sentences exceeding the maximum for the single most serious crime.
        In order to impose such a sentence, the court must actually find, as a matter of fact, that the defendant will continue to pose a danger to the community during the extended term and that his continued isolation is actually necessary. Such a finding does not necessarily justify pyramiding consecutive maximum sentences; rather, such a finding permits only an incrementally more severe sentence based on the actual need for protection of the public under the totality of the circumstances of the prosecution’s case. Hancock v. State, 741 P.2d 1210 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentence of 169 years without possibility of parole was not clearly mistaken, where the circumstances surrounding defendant’s offenses of murder, robbery and assault plainly justified a worst offender finding and defendant had four times been convicted of felony offenses and had served substantial prior time in prison and on parole. Weitz v. State, 794 P.2d 952 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the record supported the finding that the defendant’s crime was among the worst second-degree murders, a sentence exceeding the benchmark standard was appropriate. In addition to finding the defendant’s crime to be among the worst second-degree murders, the judge also found that the defendant had been involved in numerous other crimes and was among the worst class of offenders. Hence, the judge could exceed the benchmark standard. Cheely v. State, 861 P.2d 1168 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        A finding of “worst offender” need not be based on the facts of the defendant’s present offense. A defendant can be classified as a “worst offender” based either on the circumstances surrounding the present offense, or on criminal history, or both. White v. State, 969 P.2d 646 (Alaska Ct. App. 1998).

       <p>
        Where defendant had previously been convicted of four sexual offenses involving children and there was evidence of numerous other child sexual assaults for which he had not been charged, the trial court properly sentenced defendant as a third felony offender and a worst offender to the maximum sentence of 30 years upon his conviction for first-degree sexual abuse of a minor.

        When a statute provides a greater maximum penalty for a crime based on specified aggravating factors, Alaska’s guarantees of due process and of trial by jury requires treatment of the statute as creating separate offenses, and treatment of the aggravating factors as elements of the aggravated form of the offense. The defendant will not be subject to the greater maximum penalty unless the charging document specifies the pertinent aggravating factors and the state proves these aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt at the defendant’s trial. If the alleged crime is a felony, then Alaska’s guarantee of grand jury indictment also requires the state to establish the pertinent aggravating factors at grand jury. Malloy v.

        Defendant’s 25-year sentence with 10 years suspended, or 15 years to serve, for over one dozen drug offenses, the most serious of which was the unclassified felony of first-degree controlled substance misconduct, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, was proper because defendant imported large volumes of cocaine into Alaska over a lengthy period of time, but he had no significant criminal history and the judge found that defendant had a good potential for rehabilitation.

        The “clearly mistaken” test implies a permissible range of reasonable sentences which a reviewing court, after an independent review of the record, will not modify.

        Where two defendants were convicted of first-degree murder and one of second-degree murder for the same crime, the sentencing judge was entitled to make his own evaluation of the evidence in deciding how culpable was the behavior of the one convicted of second-degree murder. Where the record before the jury sufficed to support the conclusion that the defendant convicted of second-degree murder was as guilty of premeditated murder as were the other defendants, the maximum term of 99 years received by each of the defendants, though certainly severe, was justified by the extreme nature of their crime. Ridgley v. State, 739 P.2d 1299 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant, convicted of first-degree murder, was sentenced to the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 99 years imposed by a judge, not a jury, the sentence was not unconstitutional because the offense involved subjecting the victim to substantial physical torture. Malloy v. State, 153 P.3d 1003 (Alaska Ct. App. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Combination of the automatic waiver statute and the adult sentencing statute was consistent with evolving standards of decency and this scheme bore a fair and substantial relationship to the legitimate purposes of punishment; the sentencing judge gave the minor defendant’s rehabilitative prospects careful scrutiny and appropriate weight and the resulting sentence for first-degree murder was not clearly mistaken.

        Sentencing judge's imposition of a partially consecutive composite sentence of 80 years' imprisonment, with another 20 years suspended, when defendant was convicted of first-degree murder for killing his spouse and second-degree murder for killing his infant child was not clearly mistaken. The judge considered defendant's military service and potential for rehabilitation, community condemnation, and the fact that, if and when defendant got out of prison, he would be under active supervision for the rest of his life.

        Where burglary and theft offenses were property crimes integrally related with the murder for which defendants were convicted, and they were part of a single criminal episode involving the same victim, the sentencing record did not establish any actual need for consecutive sentences in excess of 99 years, given the youthfulness of the defendants (19, 16, and 17 years), their lack of any prior adult convictions, and their lack of prior involvement in any crime of violence. Under the 99-year sentences for murder alone, the defendants would not become eligible for parole consideration until they had completed serving one-third of their terms — 33 years of imprisonment, and even then, they would be entitled to release on discretionary parole only if it appeared, based on all available information, that they would conform their behavior to the requirements of the law and that they would not pose a danger to the community.

In considering an attempted murder sentence, as the gap between attempt and completion narrows, the justification for disparate treatment of an offender convicted of attempted murder, on the one hand, and an offender convicted of the completed crime, on the other, diminishes commensurately; as the crimes grow similar, so should the sentences. Defendant’s sentence was not clearly mistaken. Rudden v. State, 881 P.2d 328 (Alaska Ct. App. 1994).

        In an attempted murder case, defendant’s sentence of 70 years’ imprisonment with 20 years suspended was within the permissible range of reasonable sentences.

        For a first felony offender convicted of third-degree assault, a sentence of five years with one year suspended (four years to serve), which exceeded the three-year presumptive term for a third felony offender, was not excessive based upon aggravating factors in the facts of the case, and by defendant’s history of repeated serious violence against the same victim. Pickard v. State, 965 P.2d 755 (Alaska Ct. App. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        A sentence of five years and and nine months with three years suspended, for multiple convictions, the most serious of which was assault in the third degree, was not excessive where the presentence report emphasized that the defendant had a history of assaults on active duty police officers and where the sentencing judge stated that the defendant’s behavior of totally losing control of himself and engaging in dangerous and assaultive behavior was a consistent pattern and that he was a “dangerous person” for whom rehabilitation was very guarded.

        , on a first offender with a lengthy history of sexually assaultive conduct committed against his stepdaughters was clearly mistaken.
        The sentencing record did not justify the assumption that the defendant was destined to fail at rehabilitation that appeared to have been central in the decision on sentencing.
        There was no indication that the defendant ever resorted to violence or threats of violence, no physical injury resulted from the assaults, and the emotional and psychological injuries suffered by the victims were probably somewhat less than usual in such cases; the fact that the assaultive conduct was repeated over an extended period of time, while a significant aggravating factor, did not justify treating the defendant as a worst offender and imposing a maximum sentence. (see 2003 amendment) Polly v. State, 706 P.2d 700 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentence of 20 years with 12 years suspended for first-degree sexual assault, where the defendant was subject to an eight-year presumptive term was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing where there was essentially only a single aggravator properly applicable, not three; where the sentencing court failed to state what weights it attached to the aggravators; and where the amount of suspended time was excessive.
        The superior court was directed to impose a sentencing not exceeding 12 years with four suspended. (see 2003 amendment) Braaten v. State, 705 P.2d 1311 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).

        Review of cases which address sexual assaults involving both adult and child victims supports a sentencing range for aggravated offenses of 10 to 15 years, and use of Atkinson and Depp as benchmarks for determining the kind of conduct warranting a sentence within that range.
        These benchmarks are applicable to all aggravated cases because of:
        (1) multiple victims; (2) multiple assaults on a single victim; or, (3) serious injuries to one or more victims. State v. Andrews, 707 P.2d 900 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985), aff’d (see 2003 amendment), 723 P.2d 85 (Alaska 1986).

        It was not manifestly unjust to impose a five-year presumptive term upon defendant’s conviction of attempted sexual assault of a minor, and he was not automatically entitled as a matter of law, to have his case referred to a three-judge panel for sentencing.

       </p>
       <p>
        In defendant’s sexual assault case, consecutive 15-year sentences were proper because the trial court found that defendant had a “profound antisocial nature,” and that he was a “particularly violent and dangerous” offender; the sexual assaults were “reprehensible and destructive” to both the victim and the community, and defendant was a worst offender with no likelihood of rehabilitation. Douglas v. State, 151 P.3d 495 (Alaska Ct. App. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s request to refer his case to a three-judge sentencing panel where defendant refused to accept responsibility for the sexual assault and he had not proven the non-statutory mitigating factor of exceptional prospects for rehabilitation. Defendant’s conduct did not differ significantly from a typical offender. Manrique v. State, 177 P.3d 1188 (Alaska Ct. App. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's decision declining to refer defendant's case to the three-judge sentencing panel was not clearly mistaken as the trial court found that defendant's rehabilitative prospects were guarded at best, given his 17 prior misdemeanors and his mature age of 45 years; and the judge still imposed a sentence near the bottom of the 5- to 15-year presumptive range for second-degree sexual assault of an incapacitated woman.

        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's request for referral to the three-judge panel because defendant failed to establish that it was manifestly unjust to sentence him within the applicable 4- to 30-year sentencing range; defendant had a criminal history, and the sentencing judge expressed concern about the impact of alcohol consumption on his conduct, given that the victims testified that defendant was intoxicated when he assaulted them.

        Where the statewide three-judge sentencing panel found that it would not be manifestly unjust to sentence defendant within the presumptive range for third-degree sexual assault (engaging in sexual contact with an incapacitated person), the three-judge panel did not err in rejecting defendant's claim of manifest injustice because defendant did not focus on the specific circumstances of his prior offenses or argue how those circumstances differentiated him from the typical offender with prior felony convictions for property offenses; and defendant largely overlooked his remaining criminal history, which included a string of misdemeanors and probation violations following his release from prison, and a fourth-degree assault conviction.

        In a case in which defendant was convicted of sexual assault in the second degree (sexual penetration with an incapacitated person), defendant’s 15-year sentence with 6 years suspended was not excessive as the superior court found three statutory aggravating factors, which authorized the superior court to impose a sentence of up to 99 years; and all three aggravators were related to defendant’s prior criminal history and included nine misdemeanor charges - including attempted sexual abuse of a minor in the third degree for engaging in sexual conduct with a 15-year-old while she was asleep, and assault in the fourth degree for an incident that arose after he tried to force himself onto a woman in a restroom.

        In a case involving first-degree sexual assault and other offenses, a composite term of 19 years in prison was not excessive where the trial judge gave reasons for exceeding the presumptive range for the most serious offense; the reasons included defendant’s many convictions, his abuse of his patients’ trust, and the misuse of his medical privileges to satisfy his personal wants.

        Upon conviction of second-degree robbery, where the defendant was a third-felony offender, eligible for a presumptive term of six years imprisonment, and two aggravating factors were found, i.e., the victim sustained physical injury and the defendant was on felony probation when he committed the crime, the court did not err in sentencing the defendant to serve an additional three years beyond a composite term of six years and 10 months to which he had been sentenced in two unrelated cases.

        Defendant pled guilty to second-degree robbery after having used a toy gun to rob a bank in order to be arrested so he could obtain medical treatment. Nevertheless, his use of the toy gun was traumatic to the bank teller, who did not know it was a toy, and the defendant’s past record and history of mental illness made it safer for the community to have him confined.

        Total sentence of fifty years, imposed after convictions of two counts of first-degree robbery and two counts of third-degree assault, was clearly mistaken, where defendant was a youthful offender who had never before demonstrated a proclivity toward comparable acts of aggravated violence and the court’s decision to base defendant’s sentence on the assumption that he was incorrigible was unjustified.

        Although the defendant had a history of increasingly serious criminal misconduct and had persisted in offending despite a prior misdemeanor conviction in Florida and his current felony conviction, given the absence of significant past deterrent or rehabilitative efforts, and in light of a finding that the defendant may have been amenable to treatment for the psychological problems underlying his criminal behavior, the record did not support the sentencing court’s finding that the defendant could neither be rehabilitated nor deterred. The court’s imposition of a maximum sentence of 10 years based on this finding was, therefore, clearly mistaken. Keyser v. State, 856 P.2d 1170 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).

        The legislature clearly intended that anyone who used a dangerous instrument — any kind of weapon — should be liable for the aggravated offense of robbery in the first degree; beyond that, it intended that offenders who used firearms — a particularly dangerous subcategory of dangerous instrument — should further be subject to an enhanced presumptive term.

        Subsection (b) of this section requires the same level of proof by clear and convincing evidence on both issues of fact — child’s age and position of authority in relation to the child — that trigger the higher mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for second-degree murder; the Alaska legislature’s failure to specify a burden of proof on the issue of a victim’s age appears to stem from faulty drafting rather than intentional policy.

        The presumptive term for a first-felony offender convicted of a class A felony is seven years.

        When sentencing a first felony offender in a normal case, prior law did require a sentencing judge to find statutory aggravating factors or extraordinary circumstances before imposing an unsuspended term of imprisonment exceeding the presumptive term for a second felony offender; however, those provisions did not constrain a sentencing judge to impose less than the presumptive term for a third felony offender when the judge found that the state had proven that a statutory aggravating factor or factors applied.

Defendant’s age, military service, and post-traumatic stress disorder were considered, and the panel ultimately concluded that, in light of defendant’s criminal history, lack of remorse, and repeated failures at rehabilitation, these factors did not make him atypical among repeat sexual offenders, and he was therefore not entitled to a sentence below the presumptive term.

Because a 25- to 35-year presumptive range applied to defendant’s 2007 offense, his proposed mitigating factors were rejected, and the superior court had the duty to impose at least 2 years of the other sentence consecutively, the effective minimum sentence was 27 years’ imprisonment; reasons were given as to why defendant should have received a more severe sentence.

        Trial court did not impose an excessive sentence for a first offender following defendant’s conviction for numerous counts of assault stemming from two separate incidents because the trial court found that defendant repeatedly used his airplane to try to frighten other guides and hunters away from his camps and intentionally used his airplane to make the victims fear that he was going to hit them. The judge noted that defendant had done this even though a client was in the back seat of his airplane and concluded that defendant’s actions could easily have caused a fatal accident; it was also significant that defendant committed the assaults on two separate occasions on different groups of hunters.

       <p>
        Sentencing judge could re-sentence a first felony offender after revoking probation even if defendant’s sentence exceeded the presumptive sentence for a second felony offender. When the superior court revoked defendant’s probation and imposed suspended imprisonment above the limit originally set, the superior court’s action did not trigger defendant’s right to a jury trial because, when the sentencing court suspended a portion of defendant’s term of imprisonment and placed defendant on probation, it was understood that, if defendant violated the probation conditions, the sentencing court had the authority to order defendant to serve the previously suspended jail time.

        Following the revocation of defendant’s probation, a judge imposed the remainder of defendant’s previously suspended sentence, five years and four months of imprisonment. Although defendant was a first time felony offender, the judge’s findings were supported by the record and supported the sentence he imposed.

        Defendant was convicted of 13 felonies, which were alleged in two indictments; defendant argued that a 21-year composite term sentence was excessive. However, several aggravating factors applied such that the imposition of the composite term was not clearly mistaken.

       <p>
        A composite sentence of seven years of active imprisonment with an additional three years suspended for second-degree sexual abuse of a minor was proper because the sentence was within the applicable presumptive range of five to 15 years and, while defendant had normal prospects for rehabilitation, a three-judge panel focused on the “egregious” nature of his use of a vibrator and pressuring the victim to recant.

        Superior court properly imposed a composite sentence of 55 years to serve and an additional 10 years suspended for second-degree sexual abuse of a minor and attempted second-degree sexual abuse of a minor because the counts included 15 different acts with 11 different victims over a period of nearly five years, the absence of the “most serious” aggravator meant only that defendant's conduct fell within the broad middle range of conduct, the court was required to impose at least some portion of the sentences consecutively and to suspend at least two to three years of defendant's sentence, and the court thoroughly analyzed the required criteria and concluded a lesser sentence would be insufficient to meet the goals of sentencing.

        Nothing in the statutory language of former AS 11.05.050, either express or implied, indicated that the decision of one judge not to impose a consecutive sentence on one of several convictions deprived another judge, sentencing for a separate conviction, from availing himself of the option to sentence consecutively.

        Even though judge who sentenced defendant for the robbery conviction intended that the robbery sentence be concurrent with whatever sentence defendant might receive upon revocation of probation for damaging an aircraft, the sentencing court on the robbery charge had no authority to restrict the lawful sentencing options of the judge who later sentenced defendant upon revocation of his probation for damaging an aircraft to a sentence consecutive to the robbery sentence.

        Because a consecutive sentence was only required when defendant was sentenced for a crime that defendant committed after the issuance of a judgment against defendant for an earlier crime, and defendant committed the weapons misconduct before the judgment was issued against him for the drug convictions, the court was not required to impose consecutive sentences for the weapons misconduct offense under this statute.

       <p>
        By authorizing consecutive sentences, the statute, in effect, gave the trial court the power to sentence a defendant convicted of multiple crimes to a term of imprisonment longer than the statutory maximum for any one of them. A concomitant of this authority was the power to fix a minimum term of imprisonment for parole eligibility purposes, based on the entire term of imprisonment. Thomas v. State, 566 P.2d 630 (Alaska 1977).

       <p>
        Trial court judges could impose consecutive sentences in excess of the maximum penalty for the most serious offense, or which were greater than the presumptive sentence for the most serious offense; however, the court of appeals would review the sentence to assure that the record reflected substantial reasons for the imposition of such a sentence.

        In a case involving two counts of first-degree sexual abuse of a minor, a composite term of 37 years’ imprisonment with 5 years suspended was not error; defendant’s argument that the sentence was improper since presumptive sentencing ranges for sexual felonies used to be substantially lower was rejected. Because a 25- to 35-year presumptive range applied to defendant’s 2007 offense, his proposed mitigating factors were rejected, and the superior court had the duty to impose at least 2 years of the other sentence consecutively, the effective minimum sentence was 27 years’ imprisonment; reasons were given as to why defendant should have received a more severe sentence.

        In a case in which defendant was convicted of six controlled substance misconduct offenses, the minimum sentence defendant faced for all of the offenses was 15 years as the court was not required to run any of the sentences on the drug convictions consecutively; thus, because the appellate court was unable to discern from the record why the court ran defendant's sentences on the class A and class B felony convictions completely consecutively, particularly given the court's recognition that a 26-year sentence was exponentially greater than any sentence defendant had been ordered to serve previously, the court was to consider defendant's composite sentence on remand.

       Defendant's sentence for two counts of child neglect under Anchorage, Alaska, Mun.

       The district court judge was not clearly mistaken in characterizing a defendant as a worst offender, and in imposing the maximum sentence of one year for third-degree criminal mischief (joyriding).
       Despite the limited period of time in which the defendant committed the offenses, the defendant’s record, coupled with the especially serious nature of the particular joyriding offenses, i.e., that it was committed in order to perpetrate a felony, justifies the sentence imposed.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not impose an excessive sentence for a first offender following defendant’s conviction for numerous counts of assault stemming from two separate incidents because the trial court found that defendant repeatedly used his airplane to try to frighten other guides and hunters away from his camps and intentionally used his airplane to make the victims fear that he was going to hit them. The judge noted that defendant had done this even though a client was in the back seat of his airplane and concluded that defendant’s actions could easily have caused a fatal accident; it was also significant that defendant committed the assaults on two separate occasions on different groups of hunters.

       Defendant’s composite sentence of six months in prison for criminal mischief was not improperly imposed for the primary purpose of rehabilitation due to defendant’s mental health issues; rather, the trial court based its decision on defendant’s prior criminal history and the serious and offensive nature of the instant crime, which included spray-painting swastikas and offensive messages on several businesses.

       Trial court’s sentencing decision was clearly mistaken where the sentence fell near the bottom of the authorized range of sentences for fourth-degree assault and the evidence concerning defendant’s background and personal characteristics provided little basis for characterizing his case as particularly mitigated, including two prior misdemeanor convictions.

       District court's decision that defendant was not covered by AS 12.55.135(a)(1)(C), and that his maximum sentence was 30 days' imprisonment was subject to reversal. Defendant, who had one conviction for operating a motor vehicle under the influence, failed to show that AS 12.55.135(a)(1)(C), which declares that the maximum penalty for a class A misdemeanor is one year's imprisonment, should be interpreted at odds with the normal rule of statutory construction words in the plural number include the singular.

       Where a defendant has spent seven years between the date of his unconditional discharge on his most recent prior felony without committing another felony, he is not subject to presumptive sentencing, but where less than seven years separates his unconditional discharge on a prior felony from the commission of his current offense then all prior felony offenses, however remote, may be considered for purposes of presumptive sentencing.

       The court of appeals rejected defendant’s contention that paragraph (a)(1) of this section should be interpreted so that once there is any break of seven years between discharge from supervision after one felony conviction and commission of a new offense, offenses occurring prior to the seven-year break may no longer be considered for purposes of presumptive sentencing.

       Regardless of whether another’s state’s definition of felony driving while intoxicated (DWI) is sufficiently “similar” to Alaska’s definition to qualify as a prior felony conviction under subparagraph (a)(1)(B) of this section, Alaska’s longstanding policy that a defendant’s status as a repeat offender hinges on the date of the defendant’s prior conviction obliges a court to refuse to recognize a felony DWI conviction from another state if, given the dates of the defendant’s out-of-state offenses and resulting convictions, the defendant could not have been convicted of felony DWI if he had accumulated the same criminal history in Alaska; because Arkansas law focused on the dates of the conduct that led to prior convictions, defendant’s Arkansas conviction could not be deemed a prior felony conviction for presumptive sentencing purposes under the definition contained in subparagraph (a)(1)(B) of this section.

       Superior court properly sentenced defendant as a second felony offender because a felony driving under the influence conviction from Montana was a "prior felony conviction"; the elements of felony DUI as defined under Montana law are sufficiently similar to the elements of felony DUI as defined in Alaska, even though, in Montana, a defendant has no right to demand a jury trial on the question of their prior convictions.

       Fact that, in Alaska, a defendant's prior convictions are normally not litigated to the jury, even though felony driving under the influence (DUI) defendants have a right to jury trial on this element, suggests that the legislature did not intend subsection (a)(1)(B) to exclude felony DUI convictions from Montana and other states where a defendant's prior convictions are, by law, litigated to the sentencing judge.

       Defendant’s sentence was illegal because he was sentenced as a second felony offender, but defendant had been convicted of four felonies, and the most recent prior felony conviction occurred less than ten years before the current conviction, so the trial court had no discretion not to consider all of defendant’s prior felony convictions.

       When a party has had insufficient time to comply with the notice requirements relating to proof of prior convictions or aggravating and mitigating factors, the appropriate remedy should normally be a continuance of the sentencing proceedings; failure to consider prior crimes for presumptive sentencing purposes can be condoned only in those cases where the state, after exercising due diligence, is unable to meet the statutory requirements for proof of a prior conviction.

       When a mandatory minimum sentence is prescribed for a repeat offender, it would be inappropriate for the court to sentence the defendant as a first offender merely because the state has failed to obtain proof of the prior conviction in time for sentencing.

       In a case involving sexual assault of a minor, a trial judge did not err by sentencing defendant to an active term of imprisonment beyond the presumptive term for first felony offenders; the judge focused specifically on the need for community condemnation and isolation. The judge did not view defendant's drinking as mitigating her conduct, finding instead that she had “very guarded” prospects for rehabilitation given her significant substance abuse history and past failures at treatment; the judge also focused on the long-term nature of the sexual abuse and the “untold harm” it had caused, and would continue to cause, defendant's son.

      Sec. 6, ch. 79, SLA 2010, provides that the changes to the aggravating factors under (c)(8) of this section made by sec. 5, ch. 79, SLA 2010, “apply to offenses occurring on or after September 13, 2010.”

      Although the 2014 amendments were to have taken effect July 1, 2014 under Sec. 42, ch. 83, SLA 2014, the Governor did not sign the bill until July 16, 2014, and so the actual effective date of the 2014 amendments was July 17, 2014 under AS

The Alaska legislature has retained the basic framework of presumptive sentencing, including the same scheme of aggravating factors and mitigating factors, but with the proviso that many of these aggravating factors are to be litigated to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt under current subsection (f).

       <p>
        Defendant had no notice of the proposed statutory aggravator until after he had waived his right to a jury trial and the bench trial had already commenced; thus, his waiver could not reasonably be interpreted as including a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to a jury trial on the statutory aggravator.

        Although the defense attorney conceded the brutality of the assaults, she argued why the assaults should nevertheless not be found to be most serious; because a jury might have resolved those factual questions differently than the judge and might have reached a different conclusion regarding the existence of the aggravator, the error in considering defendant's jury trial waiver as a waiver of his right to a jury trial on the statutory aggravator was not harmless.

        Trial court erred by failing to refer defendant’s case to a three-judge sentencing panel where the trial court found the non-statutory mitigating factor of extraordinary potential for rehabilitation, and no statutory mitigators were proved. The question that the trial court should have asked was whether, because of the non-statutory mitigator, it was manifestly unjust to fail to make some adjustment to the otherwise allowable sentence.

        Review of cases which address sexual assaults involving both adult and child victims supports a sentencing range for aggravated offenses of 10 to 15 years, and use of
        <i>
         Atkinson v. State,
        </i>
        699 P.2d 881 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985), and
        <i>
         Depp v. State,
        </i>
        686 P.2d 712 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984), as benchmarks for determining the kind of conduct warranting a sentence within that range.
        These benchmarks are applicable to all aggravated cases because of:
        (1) multiple victims; (2) multiple assaults on a single victim; or, (3) serious injuries to one or more victims. State v. Andrews, 707 P.2d 900 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which defendant was sentenced to 90 years' imprisonment with 20 years suspended after defendant pleaded guilty to two consolidated counts of first-degree sexual assault for sexually assaulting four different women and attempting to sexually assault a fifth woman, the record amply supported the sentencing court's findings that defendant's victims were particularly vulnerable.

       <p>
        In a case in which defendant pled guilty to sexual assault in the third degree pursuant to a plea agreement, and agreed that the "most serious offense" aggravator applied to his case, the appellate court concluded that defendant's sentence of 40 years in prison with 10 years suspended was not clearly mistaken. Baker v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Aug. 22, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        See Montes v. State, 669 P.2d 961 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983); Leavitt v. State, 806 P.2d 342 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant received a ten-year presumptive sentence for attempted first-degree murder as a second felony offender and appealed on the ground that the trial court gave insufficient consideration to former paragraph (d)(8) of this section, the mitigating factor that his prior felony of burglary was a less serious crime than the present offense, the court of appeals held that the trial judge’s decision to give the mitigator little weight because he stressed general deterrence and affirmation of community norms was appropriate and the sentence was not clearly mistaken. Staael v. State, 697 P.2d 1050 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentence of eight-year presumptive term for first-degree sexual abuse of a minor and concurrent sentences of three years for two counts of second-degree sexual abuse of a minor to run concurrently with the eight-year term were upheld.
        The defendant’s continued efforts to justify his conduct as “sex education” and his only limited acceptance and understanding of the grave risks of psychological damage to children that his conduct presented led the court of appeals to conclude the trial judge was not clearly erroneous in concluding that the mitigating factor of conduct among the least serious in the definition of the offense was not established by clear and convincing evidence. S.B. v. State, 706 P.2d 695 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a trial judge found, based upon substantial evidence in the form of defendant’s past proven criminal record, that defendant would remain a danger to the community for the remainder of his life, a sentence of 97 years with 32 years suspended was not clearly mistaken. Contreras v. State, 767 P.2d 1169 (Alaska Ct. App. 1989), disapproved, State v. Bumpus, 820 P.2d 298 (Alaska 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Imposition of an aggravated presumptive term of ten years for nonalcohol-related vehicular manslaughter and a consecutive suspended four-year sentence for assault in the second degree was not clearly mistaken, where defendant’s callousness and irresponsibility were evidenced by his conduct in eluding police officers, racing down a highway, and running red lights before colliding with another vehicle. Barney v. State, 786 P.2d 925 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentence of ten years with four years suspended, in the case of a first offender convicted of six counts of sexual abuse of a minor in the second degree, was affirmed, where defendant was the victim’s music teacher and his abuse of the student-teacher relationship made it an exceptionally aggravated case. Osterback v. State, 789 P.2d 1037 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Three-year sentence for failure to appear was not clearly mistaken, where defendant had been convicted of three or more prior felonies and the sentencing judge was entitled to take into account defendant’s long history of alcohol abuse and record of offenses in concluding that his prospects for rehabilitation were guarded. Hayes v. State, 790 P.2d 713 (Alaska Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for second degree sexual abuse of a minor, aggravating factors under this section justified a sentence exceeding the 6-year presumptive term: 1. defendant had known that his victim was particularly incapable of resistance due to her intoxication; 2. defendant had previously been convicted of sexually abusing a minor, the same crime for which he was now being sentenced; and 3. defendant had been on probation from this prior felony when he committed the present offense. Steve v. State, 875 P.2d 110 (Alaska Ct. App. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        A substantial term of imprisonment was warranted where trial court found that defendant had a lengthy history of sexually abusing children, that defendant’s prior, uncharged sexual abuse was even more serious than his present offense, and that defendant was adamantly unwilling to acknowledge that he had committed any wrongdoing; nine years’ imprisonment with three years suspended was not clearly mistaken. Turpin v. State, 890 P.2d 1128 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court specifically addressed defendant’s prospects for rehabilitation and found them problematic where, on the one hand, defendant confessed to the police before the abuse came to the attention of the authorities in any other fashion and, on the other hand, following this confession (and before his indictment), defendant again sexually abused his stepdaughter; although court concluded that, on the whole, defendant’s prospects for rehabilitation were good, court found that, under all the circumstances, defendant’s offense was “moderately aggravated” and that defendant should serve a considerate term of imprisonment, accompanied by a lengthy suspended term, nine years imprisonment with six years suspended. Nagasiak v. State, 890 P.2d 1134 (Alaska Ct. App. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        A composite sentence of six years to serve, with an additional three years suspended, for second-degree sexual abuse of a minor and fourth-degree misconduct involving possession of cocaine was affirmed where the defendant conceded the aggravating factor that his conduct was among the most serious within the definition of second-degree sexual abuse of a minor because he sexually penetrated the victim both vaginally and anally and she suffered physical injury to her genitals and rectum. Reese v. State, 930 P.2d 1295 (Alaska Ct. App. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        For a first felony offender convicted of third-degree assault, a sentence of five years with one year suspended (four years to serve), which exceeded the three-year presumptive term for a third felony offender, was not excessive based upon aggravating factors in the facts of the case and upon defendant’s history of repeated serious violence against the same victim. Pickard v. State, 965 P.2d 755 (Alaska Ct. App. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Maximum term of five years imprisonment was upheld for felony driving while intoxicated, where supported by finding that defendant’s criminal history included repeated instances of assault and finding that defendant was “worst offender” for sentencing purposes. White v. State, 969 P.2d 646 (Alaska Ct. App. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on defendant’s exceptionally aggravated offense, his recidivism, his lack of remorse, and his failure to take responsibility for his crimes, including extensive perjury at the sentencing hearing, sentencing judge could properly conclude that defendant’s prospects for rehabilitation were poor, and, given his status as a second felony offender, a sentence of seven years for third-degree controlled substance misconduct was not clearly mistaken. Martin v. State, 973 P.2d 1151 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The sentencing court was not clearly mistaken in imposing a composite presumptive sentence which, if entirely consecutive sentences were applied with no aggravating factors, was approximately half of the maximum sentence he could have received for convictions of multiple counts of first degree sexual assault, one count of first degree robbery and one count of second degree assault, where the evidence of the defendant’s horrific crimes supported a finding that he displayed an ingrained compulsive criminal pattern in his behaviors. State v. Hodari, 996 P.2d 1230 (Alaska 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant had previously been convicted of four sexual offenses involving children and there was evidence of numerous other child sexual assaults for which he had not been charged, the trial court properly found the state had proved five of the aggravating factors under subsection (c) and sentenced defendant as a third felony offender and a worst offender to the maximum sentence of 30 years upon his conviction for first-degree sexual abuse of a minor. Fitzgerald v. State, 42 P.3d 1143 (Alaska Ct. App. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court did not err in sentencing defendant on defendant’s robbery conviction where a presentence report established an aggravating factor by clear and convincing evidence, and defendant did not prove that there were any mitigating factors. Butts v. State, 53 P.3d 609 (Alaska Ct. App. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on defendant’s aggravators, the trial court judge was authorized to impose a sentence of up to 20 years’ imprisonment on each of defendant’s first-degree assault convictions; because defendant did not prove any mitigating factors, the 15-year presumptive term was, in essence, the minimum sentence that the trial judge might impose for the two felonies, and the record supported the conclusions that defendant posed a great danger to the public safety and had poor prospects for rehabilitation, such that his 26-year sentence was proper. Powell v. State, 88 P.3d 532 (Alaska Ct. App. 2004).

       <p>
        Where defendant was convicted of attempted first-degree sexual assault, attempted second-degree sexual assault, and burglary, for a composite sentence of 12 years with 4 years suspended, 8 years to serve, the sentence was not excessive; aggravating factors under paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(8) of this section were properly applied, because defendant knew the victim was vulnerable and defendant had a criminal history of assaultive behavior; a jury trial was not required on the aggravating factors. Moore v. State, 123 P.3d 1081 (Alaska Ct. App. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s sentence was upheld, considered in light of

        542 U.S. 296, 124 S. Ct. 2531, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2004), and two aggravators: (1) Under subsection (c)(7), that defendant’s federal felony was a more serious class of felony than his current offense, and (2) under subsection (c)(20), that defendant was on probation from that prior federal felony when he committed the offense in the instant case. With respect to aggravator (c)(7), under Alaska law, robbery in any form was a more serious class of felony than possession of cocaine without intent to distribute. As to aggravator (c)(20) (regarding defendant being on felony probation), while it was unclear whether the trial court actually relied on that factor, because it was undisputed that defendant was a felony probationer when he committed his current offense, any error in the trial court’s having failed to give him a jury trial on that issue was harmless. Snelling v. State, 123 P.3d 1096 (Alaska Ct. App. 2005).

        A sentence of twenty-four years with four years suspended, upon conviction of three counts of sexual abuse of a minor in the first degree, was clearly mistaken, where the trial court did not address the ten- to fifteen-year benchmark established in prior decisions concerning aggravated cases of sexual assault, and nothing in the record established that a sentence in excess of fifteen years was necessary to protect the public.

        Imposition of consecutive terms totaling 23 years of unsuspended imprisonment was clearly mistaken, where, although defendant was convicted for multiple burglaries, the record failed to support the inference that he was incapable of being deterred or rehabilitated, or that the protection of the community required his isolation for a period of 23 years.

        Defendant receiving a reduced presumptive term sentence was not eligible for discretionary parole under the parole board regulations; the trial court had no power to grant parole eligibility when imposing a mitigated presumptive term sentence, and the sentencing court erred when it designated the defendant’s sentence as non-presumptive.

        In a case in which defendant was convicted of six controlled substance misconduct offenses, the minimum sentence defendant faced for all of the offenses was 15 years as the court was not required to run any of the sentences on the drug convictions consecutively; thus, because the appellate court was unable to discern from the record why the court ran defendant's sentences on the class A and class B felony convictions completely consecutively, particularly given the court's recognition that a 26-year sentence was exponentially greater than any sentence defendant had been ordered to serve previously, the court was to consider defendant's composite sentence on remand.

       </p>
       <p>
        The adjustment of a presumptive sentence for aggravating or mitigating factors essentially involves a two-step process: The first step, an evidentiary one, is comprised of establishing existence of specially alleged factors, and each alleged factor must be proved by clear and convincing evidence with the proponent of the factor bearing the burden of proof. The second step involves a judgmental element, rather than an evidentiary one, and requires an evaluation by the court of factors that have been established, and a determination of the extent to which the factors will justify an upward or downward adjustment of the applicable presumptive term. Juneby v. State, 665 P.2d 30 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).

       <p>
        When a case involving a presumptive term in excess of four years is referred to the three-judge panel on the sole basis of a nonstatutory mitigating factor, imposition by the panel of a sentence below 50% of the presumptive term will normally be deemed inappropriate and clearly mistaken, unless the panel expressly concludes that such a sentence is required to avoid manifest injustice, although the panel has jurisdiction to impose a sentence of less than 50% of the presumptive sentence. State v. Price, 740 P.2d 476 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987) (decided under former law).

        Federal law does not prohibit the three-judge sentencing panel from considering the harsh collateral consequences of deportation and, if manifest injustice would otherwise result, from imposing a sentence below the presumptive range based on that consideration.

       <p>
        A three-judge sentencing panel has the statutory authority to impose a sentence below the presumptive range based on the harsh collateral consequences of deportation. If the three-judge panel was precluded from considering this factor as a matter of law, there is a substantial risk that unduly harsh sentences would be imposed on non-citizens in particular cases, defeating the legislature’s goal of uniformity in sentencing.

       <p>
        A court may sentence an offender to imprisonment for a term greater than the maximum sentence for the offender’s most serious offense if the sentencing judge makes a finding that the sentence is necessary to protect the public. A finding that the defendant is a serious threat to society and a worst possible offender is sufficient. Wheeler v. State, 863 P.2d 858 (Alaska Ct. App. 1993).

       <p>
        In a manslaughter case, the double jeopardy clause did not prohibit a second jury trial to address the aggravator under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, as such a trial was not a second prosecution. Further, the aggravating factor was not an element of defendant’s crime for purposes of Alaska Const. art. I, § 8, requiring a jury trial under Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S. Ct. 2531, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403 (U.S. 2004).State v. Dague, 143 P.3d 988 (Alaska Ct. App. 2006).

        The task of determining the amount by which a presumptive sentence should be increased upon proof of an aggravating factor is not an evidentiary one for which the state is responsible, but a judicial one for which the court is responsible.

        It is apparent from the language contained at the beginning of subsections (c) and (d) of this section that increases or decreases of presumptive terms should not be the automatic consequence when aggravating or mitigating factors are proved.

        Court properly applied the seven-year presumptive sentence because the mandatory minimum sentences were intended for the least serious offenses within the statutory definition and defendant should receive a more severe sentence than the five-year mandatory minimum unless he affirmatively convinces the sentencing judge that his conduct was uncommonly mitigated.

        Defendant's four-year sentence for second-degree robbery was not excessive, even though his codefendant was sentenced to two-and-a-half years, because the trial court found two aggravating factors that applied based on defendant's criminal history and defendant's more severe sentence was justified by his more blameworthy role in the robbery.

Conversely, when the infliction of pain or injury is merely a direct means to accomplish the crime charged, the test for establishing the aggravating factor of deliberate cruelty will not be met.

        Trial judge did not err in finding aggravating factor (c)(5) applicable, even though the victim was nineteen years old at the time of the assault, since the assault for which the defendant was convicted culminated a long history of sexual and physical abuse that began when the victim was a young child and was particularly vulnerable to his assaultive conduct; through his prolonged pattern of abuse, the defendant rendered his victim incapable of exercising the type of resistance that could be expected from a typical nineteen-year-old.

       <p>
        Trial court did not err in finding the aggravating factor, under paragraph (c)(8), that defendant’s prior criminal history included conduct involving aggravated or repeated instances of assaultive behavior; a finding of such a prior criminal history did not require proof that defendant was prosecuted or convicted, and, thus, it was immaterial that defendant had been found not guilty by reason of insanity of murder.

       <p>
        Defendant's sentence of five years with two and a half years suspended was not clearly mistaken because his conduct of assaulting the victim was elevated to a felony based on his two prior convictions for fourth-degree assault; defendant had over ninety prior misdemeanor and minor offense convictions and multiple probation violations.

        The legislative history of paragraph (c)(10) of this section makes it clear that the drafters of this provision intended that the determination of whether an offender’s conduct “was among the most serious conduct included in the definition of the offense” was to be based on an assessment of the specific facts of each case, viewed in relation to the most serious potential conduct constituting the offense charged. Juneby v. State, 641 P.2d 823 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982), modified, 665 P.2d 30 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to find an aggravating factor under paragraph (c)(10) of this section, it is not necessary to establish that there are no other cases involving more serious conduct; it is sufficient if the offense falls within the general class of the most serious offenses. Peetook v. State, 655 P.2d 1308 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since a finding of “most serious conduct” under paragraph (c)(10) of this section would be based partly on other specified aggravating factors, this factor should properly be viewed as subsuming the aggravating factors on which it is based. Peetook v. State, 655 P.2d 1308 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Paragraph (c)(10) stresses conduct involved in specific offense under consideration rather than personal characteristics of offender and requires comparison of conduct constituting crime in question with other conduct which would satisfy elements of the offense.

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s repeated acts over a five-year period of sexual molestation of 12-year-old adopted daughter and resultant psychological damage to child could be considered as being “among the most serious conduct” under paragraph (c)(10) and, thus, may justify a sentence equal to one that could have been imposed on an offender who used a firearm or caused serious physical injury to an older victim as a result of a single isolated assault. Ecker v. State, 656 P.2d 577 (Alaska Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        While no violence was involved, trial court properly found that appellant’s embezzlement of $140,000 from her employer over a one-year period was among the most serious conduct prescribed by the statute and served to distinguish it from prior cases in which substantial sentences for embezzlement were disapproved.

        The court could properly consider the amount of damage caused to a commercial building, the value of the tractor-trailer the defendant took after entering the building, and the fact of its use and abandonment as circumstances constituting the “most serious conduct” for burglary in the second degree.

        Trial court’s finding that defendant’s perjury “was among the most serious conduct included in the definition of the offense”, as referred to in paragraph (c)(10), was not clearly erroneous, where his false testimony at a search warrant hearing concerned the events surrounding a car bombing for which he was subsequently prosecuted and convicted.

       </p>
       <p>
        In sentencing the defendant for the crimes of manslaughter and first-degree assault, the court properly found that her conduct was among the most serious within the definition of manslaughter (aggravator (c)(10)), based on the fact that the conviction encompassed three homicides and on the fact that her culpable mental state approached the culpability of second-degree murder.

        Defendant’s composite sentence of 19 years’ imprisonment with 8 years suspended was not clearly mistaken given the fact that defendant conceded one aggravating factor relating to that drug offense, the aggravator under paragraph (c)(10), that his conduct was among the most serious; as a factual matter, he actually delivered LSD to a minor.

        Evidence that, besides acts of sexual abuse, defendant had engaged in significant acts of violence both toward strangers and toward members of his own households, had already served a substantial prison sentence for a felony theft conviction, had persistently resisted both rehabilitative programs and probation supervision, and that his criminal behavior had escalated in seriousness over the past 15 years, placed his case among the most aggravated category of sexual abuse and sexual abuse offenders and supported the court’s conclusion that defendant posed a substantial degree of danger to society and that, in order to protect society, the court needed to sentence defendant to a term of imprisonment exceeding the 30-year maximum for any single count of first-degree sexual abuse. Mullin v. State, 886 P.2d 1323 (Alaska Ct. App. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendant challenged the jury's finding that his first-degree sexual abuse conviction was among the most serious within the definition of that offense, that claim was moot because the three-judge sentencing panel did not impose an aggravated sentence, and it explicitly stated that it did not give any weight to that aggravating factor in sentencing defendant.

        Although factor (c)(18) does require the victim to live in the same dwelling as the defendant, it does not require the offense to occur in the home; nor does the aggravating factor expressly require either the defendant’s or the victim’s physical presence in the home at any particular time in relation to the time of the offense, provided both are shown to be “living together” there. What constitutes “living together” is not defined. The purpose of the residency requirement, however, is to circumscribe the relevant scope of the “social unit” whose “members” are included in factor (c)(18). Williams v.

Here, the evidence before the sentencing court established that the victim, who grew up in the defendant’s home, was temporarily away from the home while attending college.

        That defendant’s minor sexual abuse victims were members of the social unit comprised of those living together in the same dwelling as the defendant serves to aggravate the offense slightly; but this aggravating factor, standing alone, would not justify imposing a sentence on a first-felony offender equal to the presumptive term for a second-felony offender; it certainly would not justify a more severe sentence than a second-felony offender would receive.

What constitutes a “large” or “small” quantity for purposes of paragraphs (c)(25) and (d)(13) should not be treated as an abstract question of law. The question must instead be resolved by the sentencing court as a factual matter, based on the totality of the evidence in the case and on the court’s discretion, as informed by the totality of its experience.

        Defendant’s claim that the harm caused by his prior and current offenses was consistently minor and inconsistent with the imposition of a substantial period of imprisonment required a two-pronged determination:
        first, the court must determine on a case-by-case basis that the defendant’s present and prior crimes are consistently minor; second, the court must find that the past and present crimes, taken as a whole, are inconsistent with a substantial term of imprisonment. Defendant, who bore the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence, failed to show adequate mitigating circumstances. Jordan v. State, 895 P.2d 994 (Alaska Ct.

       <p>
        This section provides an alleviation of the code’s treatment of imperfect defenses; evidence that defendant in good faith subjectively believed facts which, if true, would have established a defense justifying his conduct, but which the judge or jury concludes would have been unreasonable under circumstances, may warrant mitigation of presumptive sentence.

        Trial judge was justified in giving the “duress” mitigating factor little weight because defendant was aware that he had a serious mental illness that engendered hallucinations, but nevertheless put himself in a situation of high stress — working as a crew member on a commercial fishing vessel, with its attendant hard work and lengthy sleep deprivation — when he did not have the medication to treat his mental illness, and defendant must have been aware that he was placing his boat mates at risk.

        When defendant was convicted of first degree misconduct involving weapons, it was not error to reject defendant’s proposed duress mitigating factor.

        Although the defendant’s persistent mental health issues could act as a mitigating factor on sentencing, the sentence handed down for second-degree robbery was within the permissible range of sentences for that offense, and the nature of the defendant’s mental health issues made him a potential risk to the community.

        Trial judge did not err in rejecting the defendant’s argument that his conduct was among the least serious within the definition of first-degree robbery, where the robberies appeared to have been well planned, were executed in a manner calculated to render the victims relatively helpless and under circumstances that tended to minimize the possibility of a report by the victims to the police; where the defendant clearly created the impression that he had a firearm that he was prepared to use; where the defendant inflicted physical injury upon one victim; and where a substantial amount of cash was taken.

Because a 25- to 35-year presumptive range applied to defendant’s 2007 offense, his proposed mitigating factors were rejected, and the superior court had the duty to impose at least 2 years of the other sentence consecutively, the effective minimum sentence was 27 years’ imprisonment; reasons were given as to why defendant should have received a more severe sentence.

        In the sentencing phase of a second-degree murder trial, the trial judge’s rejection of defendant’s assertion that he committed the homicide under duress and after being subjected to provocation from the victim was proper; further, defendant’s challenge to the trial judge’s rulings regarding the proposed mitigating factors was moot as as the trial judge’s authority to impose the sentence did not rest on his findings concerning contested aggravating or mitigating factors.

        defined by statute, the mere fact of some physical injury to the victim as a result of the defendant’s conduct, though technically an aggravating factor under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, will not justify a significant increase in the presumptive term.

       <p>
        Since presumptive terms are intended to be applicable in typical cases, and not in aggravated or mitigated cases, the presumptive 10-year term applicable to defendant must be deemed to take into account the potential for violence and the likelihood of some degree of physical injury which is typical of the offense for which he was convicted, first-degree sexual assault.

        Superior court properly convicted defendant, following a jury trial, of second-degree sexual assault for vaginally penetrating his cousin (the victim) while she was unconscious because the evidence established that the victim was incapacitated and that defendant knew that she was incapacitated—she had four to six shots of whiskey, did not remember lying down in the bed in which she woke up, did not remember the sexual assault, and never would have consciously consented to have sex with defendant—defendant failed to explain how an error in the timing of the admission of the text messages prejudiced him, and the court engaged in a thorough review of the statutory criteria and explained in detail the reasons it imposed the sentence it did.

        While voluntary intoxication or a history of alcoholism cannot be considered an aggravating or mitigating factor for the purposes of presumptive sentencing, when a violent crime is committed under the influence of alcohol by a person with a background of alcohol-related violence, his background should be considered by the court in determining the extent to which rehabilitation will realistically be accomplished by the sentence which it intends to impose.

       <b>
        Legislature intended that this section establish two separate bases for referral
       </b>
       of a case from a trial court to a three-judge panel for sentencing.
       First, referral is warranted in situations where manifest injustice would result from failure to consider relevant, nonstatutory aggravating or mitigating factors in sentencing; and, second, where manifest injustice would result from imposition of a presumptive sentence, whether or not adjusted for statutory aggravating or mitigating factors. Dancer v. State, 715 P.2d 1174 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section establishes two distinct grounds for referral of a case to a three-judge panel:
       (1) if the presumptive term, adjusted for aggravating or mitigating factors, would be manifestly unjust or plainly unfair and, (2) if manifest injustice will result from failure to consider a nonstatutory aggravating or mitigating factor. Kirby v. State, 748 P.2d 757 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).

        Authority to create new factors. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears that the legislature, in adopting this section, in effect delegated to the three-judge panel the authority to create new aggravating and mitigating factors under the common law, which would be available for consideration in subsequent cases. Dancer v. State, 715 P.2d 1174 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986).

        Trial court’s authority. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court had no authority to declare that defendant’s case should be referred to a three-judge panel on the ground that even a sentence of forty-five years to serve was clearly mistaken; the appellate court had no authority to declare that such a sentence was not clearly mistaken, and that the trial judge therefore committed no error when he failed to refer defendant’s case to the three-judge panel. Shinault v. State, 258 P.3d 848 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not err in failing to consider whether referral to a three-judge sentencing panel was appropriate where it was aware of the restrictions on defendant's discretionary parole, understood his eligibility for parole, gave specific reasons for being cautious about his rehabilitation prospects, and found that any sentence lower than the presumptive range would have violated the sentencing goals of deterrence, community condemnation, and reaffirmation of societal norms.
       Fulling v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2016) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because there were no applicable statutory mitigators, the sentencing judge had no authority to impose a sentence below the presumptive minimum unless he referred defendant's case to the three-judge panel; the court failed to properly assess whether defendant had extraordinary potential for rehabilitation. King v. State, 487 P.3d 242 (Alaska Ct. App. 2021).

        No basis for referral to sentencing panel. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's claim that the sentencing judge should have referred his case to a statewide three-judge sentencing panel was properly rejected where his reliance on a mistaken halfway house handbook had already been rejected, his sentence had been mitigated based on his later acquittal of the underlying charges, his prior sentence in another state for sexual assault justified the sentence, and his re-conviction of a felony theft charge in Alaska remained a previous conviction for sentencing purposes.
       Jackson v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. May 24, 2017) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court was statutorily precluded from referring defendant's case to a three-judge panel based on extraordinary potential for rehabilitation where it found as a factual matter that she was on felony probation at the time she committed the instant offense, and thus, her sentence was aggravated under

       Where the sentencing record contained unusually strong evidence that a youthful first offender has a particularly favorable potential for rehabilitation, and where the absence of statutory aggravating or mitigating factors would have precluded the sentencing court from giving any consideration to that evidence in imposing a sentence, the Alaska Court of Appeals thought referral to the three-judge panel was expressly authorized under this section and AS

        <a href="#t12c55s12.55.175" target="_self">

      </p>
      <p>
       Once the court finds the mitigating factor of unusual prospects for rehabilitation in the case of a first offender, it should evaluate the factor’s impact on an appropriate sentence in the same way it would evaluate a statutory mitigating factor that had been established by clear and convincing evidence. The court should deny referral to the three-judge panel only when it concludes that no adjustment to the presumptive term is appropriate in light of the factor. Kirby v. State, 748 P.2d 757 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The superior court is justified in concluding that a defendant has unusually good potential for rehabilitation only when the court is satisfied, after reviewing the totality of the circumstances, that the defendant can adequately be treated in the community and need not be incarcerated for the full presumptive term in order to prevent future criminal activity. Lepley v. State, 807 P.2d 1095 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant has the burden to prove the mitigating factor of uncommonly good potential for rehabilitation by clear and convincing evidence. Lepley v. State, 807 P.2d 1095 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court did not err in failing to refer the defendant’s case, pursuant to this section, to the three-judge panel where the judge concluded that the defendant had failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that his unusually good prospects for rehabilitation constituted an unspecified mitigating factor warranting referral to the panel pursuant to Smith v. State, 711 P.2d 561 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985).Boerma v. State, 843 P.2d 1246 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the record showed that the defendant had refused to acknowledge responsibility for his crimes and had declined to engage in any therapy or treatment, it supported the trial judge’s ruling that the defendant failed to prove an extraordinary potential for rehabilitation. Beltz v. State, 980 P.2d 474 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       A non-statutory mitigating factor for the sentencing of a juvenile offender based on defendant’s extraordinary potential for rehabilitation could be considered because it is integrally related to the sentencing criteria of AS

       Where the legislature has expressly addressed a consideration, such as the relationship between a defendant’s past conduct and his present offense, and imposed limitations on the trial court’s power to consider that relationship in mitigation of sentence, the trial court should not propose the same mitigating factor to the three-judge panel without complying with the limitations; to do so is to suggest a common-law development inconsistent with legislation.

       Referral to a statewide sentencing panel for resentencing under Collins v. State was unwarranted because (1) the legislature repudiated Collins v.

       Defendant was convicted of first degree sexual assault of his girlfriend’s sister, and the court sentenced him at the low end of the presumptive sentence range for that offense. However, based on the legislative history of the presumptive sentencing range, defendant’s sentencing was appropriate for referral to a three judge panel. Defendant had no prior history as a sex offender, and his prospects for rehabilitation were excellent. Collins v. State, 287 P.3d 791 (Alaska Ct. App. 2012).

       Case was remanded for the trial court to reconsider referral to the three-judge panel based on manifest injustice of the applicable presumptive range where the court incorrectly believed that defendant would have been eligible for discretionary parole after serving one-third of her sentence, and that misperception may have impacted its decision to deny referral.

       applied to defendant who pled guilty to sexual abuse of a minor, the trial court was not precluded by subsection (b) of this section from referring the case to a three-judge panel based on defendant’s favorable post-offense conduct; and the panel could mitigate defendant’s presumptive term based on this non-statutory factor. State v. McKinney, 946 P.2d 456 (Alaska Ct. App. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred by failing to refer defendant’s case to the three judge sentencing panel where the trial court found the non-statutory mitigating factor of extraordinary potential for rehabilitation, and no statutory mitigators were proved. The question the trial court should have asked was whether, because of the non-statutory mitigator, it was manifestly unjust to fail to make some adjustment to the otherwise allowable sentence. Harapat v. State, 174 P.3d 249 (Alaska Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court declined to recognize “developmental immaturity” as a non-statutory mitigator appropriate for referring a juvenile’s case to the three-judge statewide panel that was authorized to depart from the normal rules that governed presumptive sentencing because such recognition would run contrary to legislative policy and recognition of that proposed non-statutory mitigator would, in effect, create a presumption that older teenagers should be treated more leniently. Smith v. State, 258 P.3d 913 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court's decision not to refer defendant's case to a three-judge sentencing panel for consideration of a non-statutory mitigator was not clearly mistaken. Defendant was caught smuggling a substantial amount of drugs (including several pounds of hash oil), with a street value of over $300,000, which defendant admitted he planned to distribute notwithstanding that such conduct was flatly prohibited by the law both at the time he was caught and the present day. Smith v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Nov. 6, 2019).

        Sentencing authority. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a matter is referred back to the original sentencing judge when the three-judge panel disagrees with the original sentencing judge indicates that the legislature wanted the original sentencing judge to maintain control of the sentencing process. Heathcock v. State, 670 P.2d 1155 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a trial judge referred a case to a three-judge panel, the panel did not have statutory authority to impose a sentence greater than the two-year presumptive sentence on the ground that the two-year presumptive sentence was manifestly unjust because it was too severe; rather the panel was required to remand the case to the trial judge for further proceedings, since it disagreed with the trial judge’s conclusion. Heathcock v. State, 670 P.2d 1155 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the provisions of the revised Criminal Code and the decision in Heathcock v. State, 670 P.2d 1155 (Alaska Ct. App. 1983), the three-judge panel does not have authority to sentence until it agreed with the trial judge that his application of the provisions of the revised Criminal Code would result in a sentence which was manifestly unjust; the panel was not free to assume that defendant could be sentenced to concurrent sentences and then go forward and sentence him. Winfree v. State, 683 P.2d 284 (Alaska Ct. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection (c), the three-judge panel is expressly empowered to impose any sentence authorized for the offense. State v. Ridgway, 750 P.2d 362 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       A three-judge panel had no authority to reduce defendant’s sentence to less than three and one-half years to serve (50% of the low end of the applicable presumptive range), even if the three-judge panel concluded that such a sentence would be manifestly too severe. Garner v. State, 266 P.3d 1045 (Alaska Ct. App. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Three-judge sentencing panel misunderstood its authority related to applying a sentence and a term of parole to defendant. Luckart v. State, 314 P.3d 1226 (Alaska Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>

       Trial court erred in failing to consider whether the prohibition on discretionary parole would result in manifest injustice after it imposed a sentenced of 15 years with 9 years suspended for second-degree sexual abuse of a minor and the three-judge sentencing panel had statutory authority to grant enhanced parole eligibility to defendants who were subject to presumptive sentencing.

       Court declined to recognize “developmental immaturity” as a non-statutory mitigator appropriate for referring a juvenile’s case to the three-judge statewide panel authorized to depart from the normal rules that governed presumptive sentencing. Such recognition was contrary to legislative policy and recognition of such a mitigator could create a presumption that older teenagers should be treated more leniently. This could require the transfer of sentencing of all younger offenders to the state-wide sentencing panel, since the panel is the only sentencing court authorized to consider non-statutory factors.

       In a second-degree sexual assault case, a three-judge panel was not clearly mistaken in finding that a 99-year presumptive term applied, even though the panel’s analysis was initially flawed due to a misreading of Moore v. State, 262 P.3d 217 (Alaska App. 2011). Defendant’s age, military service, and post-traumatic stress disorder were considered, and the panel ultimately concluded that, in light of defendant’s criminal history, lack of remorse, and repeated failures at rehabilitation, these factors did not make him atypical among repeat sexual offenders, and he was therefore not entitled to a sentence below the presumptive term.

       Defendant was convicted of first degree sexual assault of his girlfriend’s sister, and the court sentenced him at the low end of the presumptive sentence range for that offense. However, based on the legislative history of the presumptive sentencing range, defendant’s sentencing was appropriate for referral to a three judge panel.

       and this section, a presumptive term cannot be “manifestly unjust” in general, and before a sentencing judge can properly characterize a presumptive term as “manifestly unjust” in respect to a particular defendant, he must articulate specific circumstances that make that defendant significantly different from a typical offender within that category or that make the defendant’s conduct significantly different from a typical offense.

       Because defendant's case was remanded to the three-judge panel with directions to reconsider the potential manifest injustice of a sentence within the presumptive range, the court of appeals anticipated that defendant would present his arguments regarding the proper interpretation of "manifest injustice," and, therefore, it was premature for the court of appeals to resolve the issue until the three-judge panel heard defendant's arguments and reconsidered its decision. Balallo v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. July 30, 2018).

      <p>
       Where the statewide three-judge sentencing panel found that it would not be manifestly unjust to sentence defendant within the presumptive range for third-degree sexual assault (engaging in sexual contact with an incapacitated person), the three-judge panel did not err in rejecting defendant's claim of manifest injustice because defendant did not focus on the specific circumstances of his prior offenses or argue how those circumstances differentiated him from the typical offender with prior felony convictions for property offenses; and defendant largely overlooked his remaining criminal history, which included a string of misdemeanors and probation violations following his release from prison, and a fourth-degree assault conviction.

       If the three-judge panel concludes that the proper sentence for a defendant is a sentence that the single judge was authorized to impose, the panel is obliged under subsection (b) to remand the case to the single judge for sentencing, because the statute authorizes the three-judge panel to keep the case and sentence the defendant only if the panel concludes that a proper sentence lies outside the range of sentences that the single judge was authorized to impose. Morrison v. State, 7 P.3d 955 (Alaska Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Remand for resentencing was required because the three-judge panel sentenced defendant under the general provisions of subsections (b) and (c), and its error made a difference with respect to the sentences for second-degree sexual assault convictions since the applicable presumptive range for those four counts was 5 to 15 years; thus, under subsection (e) defendant's minimum active term of imprisonment for each count was 2.5 years, but the panel only gave him 1 year to serve on each conviction.

       When defendant was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse of a minor, a 99-year presumptive term of imprisonment was proper. Defendant had two prior felony convictions for attempted second-degree sexual abuse of a minor. The appellate court rejected defendant’s constitutional attack on the 99-year sentence because increased penalties for repeat felony offenders are presumptively constitutional. Sikeo v.

       Crime victim claimed that her husband’s sentence for assaulting her was illegal because he was ordered to participate in a batterer’s intervention program that was not approved by the Alaska Department of Corrections. Her application for relief was denied because neither Alaska Const. art. I, § 24 nor this section gives crime victims the right to intervene in the litigation of a criminal case. Cooper v. Dist.

       When a crime victim sought to re-open a defendant's sentencing due to being denied the right to be heard at sentencing, the application was moot because the defendant's restitution obligation had been satisfied, so it was unnecessary to consider if the victim was otherwise entitled to have the sentencing court reconsider the defendant's restitution obligation and if double jeopardy barred such a reconsideration.

Johnson v. State, 50 P.3d 404 (Alaska Ct. App. 2002).

     The Registration Act, ch. 41, SLA 1994, created a civil, nonpunitive scheme to track sex offenders and could be constitutionally applied to offenders who committed their crimes before or after the Act’s enactment. Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 123 S. Ct. 1140, 155 L. Ed. 2d 164 (U.S. 2003).
    </p>
    <p>
     For discussion of whether the sanction of the Registration Act,
     ch. 41, SLA 1994, entails an affirmative disability or restraint, whether the sanction has historically been regarded as punitive, whether the sanction depends upon a finding of scienter, whether the sanction will operate to promote traditional punishment objectives, whether the sanction applies to behavior which is already a crime, whether there is an alternative non-punitive purpose for the sanction, and whether the sanction is excessive in relation to the alternative purpose, see
     Rowe v. Burton, 884 F. Supp. 1372 (D. Alaska 1994), rev'd, 248 F.3d 832 (9th Cir. Alaska 2001), reversed on other grounds, sub nom.

       Alaska’s sex offender registration and notification statute, 1994 SLA Ch. 41, did not violate plaintiffs’ procedural due process rights because the sex offender statute based the registration and notification requirements solely on the fact of plaintiffs’ convictions, which plaintiffs already had a procedurally safeguarded opportunity to contest; procedural due process does not require the opportunity to prove a fact that is not material to the state’s statutory scheme.

      <p>
       Alaska’s sex offender registration and notification statute, 1994 SLA ch. 41, did not violate plaintiffs’ substantive due process rights because persons convicted of serious sex offenses did not have a fundamental right to be free from the statute’s registration and notification requirements, and the statute served a legitimate nonpunitive purpose of public safety by alerting the public to the risk of sex offenders in the community; further, the broad categories of offenses and the corresponding length of the reporting requirement were reasonably related to the danger of recidivism and were thus consistent with the regulatory objective. Doe v. Tandeske, 361 F.3d 594 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 817, 125 S. Ct. 56, 160 L. Ed. 2d 25 (U.S. 2004).

       Even though there was a problem for homeless sex offenders since this statute did not contain a definition of “residence,” a resolution was not required based on defendant’s vagueness challenge because employees from the Alaska Department of Public Safety had adopted an ad hoc definition of “residence” that was tailored to that situation. Therefore, defendant’s conviction for failure to register as a sex offender when he moved from a shelter to an outdoor camping area was upheld; because defendant benefitted from the Department’s policy, he failed to show that he personally was affected, or prejudiced in any manner, by the potential difficulties in defining the term “residence” as it applied to homeless sex offenders.

       Defendant was a convicted sex offender in the 1980s, prior to the enactment of Alaska’s sex offender registration act. Defendant appealed a conviction for registering false information as being ex post facto. In this advisory opinion the court of appeals found that under either of the predominant approaches to application of ex post facto laws in Alaska, defendant could not properly be convicted for violating a requirement which is, in essence, punishment, where the underlying conviction preceded the institution of the requirement.

       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of second-degree failure to register as a sex offender because the trial judge found that defendant knew that he was no longer living at the drug- and alcohol-free rooming house, knew that he would have to verify his address information at the time of his quarterly deadline, and knew that he had to give notice the next day if he changed residences; and, while defendant might have legitimately been confused or unsure about what new address or location to submit, as he was homeless, the record supported the district court's conclusion that defendant was aware that he had to do something to be in compliance with the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act.

       Defendant did not establish either manifest injustice or fair and just reason for withdrawing his no contest pleas to two counts of sexual abuse of a minor in the second degree.

       Trial court's decision requiring defendant to register for life under the Alaska Sex Offenders Registration Act (ASORA) was improper because the 1994 version of ASORA was not plainly intended to apply to offenders whose convictions have been set aside and once defendant's Colorado conviction was set aside, it was not a conviction for purposes of registration under the 1994 version of ASORA. With only one conviction, he was required to register under ASORA for 15 years rather than life. Maves v. State, 479 P.3d 399 (Alaska 2021).

      </p>
      <p>
       While the superior court properly found that the first defendant did not have to register as a sex offender in Alaska, it erred in finding that the second defendant had to register as a sex offender because both the Washington statute, relating to communicating with a minor (or someone believed to be a minor) for immoral purposes, and the California statute, relating to annoying or molesting any child under 18 years of age, under which defendants were respectively convicted, were significantly broader than and different from the Alaska offense of attempted sexual abuse of a minor in the second degree.

       Superior court was complying with its duty under Alaska R. Crim. P. 32(d) when, in its remarks at the sentencing hearing and later in its written judgment, the court declared that defendant would be required to register as a sex offender for life, but this was not a “ruling;” the superior court did not formally adjudicate defendant’s obligation under the statute but merely offered its prediction concerning how the statute would apply to defendant.

       requires an offender to be convicted of multiple sex offenses does not imply a requirement of multiple prosecutions or multiple, separate convictions; it is common for a defendant to be tried for, and convicted of, several offenses in the same proceeding and by entry of a single judgment. The statute’s plain language gives no indication that the term “two or more offenses” instead means “two or more separate arrests, charging instruments, or convictions.” On its face, then, AS

       Although the extension of the registration requirement to defendants convicted of a sex offense defined in this section before the law was enacted means that many defendants who pled guilty or no contest to a sex offense prior to enactment had no warning of this consequence when they entered their pleas, unlike those convicted subsequent to its enactment, this disparate treatment may be explained by the risk of disruption of the justice system of the potential re-opening of hundreds of criminal cases. Peterson v. State, 988 P.2d 109 (Alaska Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>

       As promulgated by the Department of Public Safety under its authority to adopt regulations to implement the purpose of the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act, the definition of “conviction,” to include a conviction that had been set aside after the completion of a suspended imposition of sentence, was consistent with the legislative purpose to protect the public.

       </b>
       among the states is 18 U.S.C. § 3182. Montague v. Smedley, 557 P.2d 774 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Purpose of this section
       </b>
       is to require that the demanding state assure the asylum state that the person sought is still under sentence by the former state and, therefore, is subject to a demand for extradition by that state. Smedley v. Holt, 541 P.2d 17 (Alaska 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a) only applies before conviction.
       </b>
       Wortham v. State, 519 P.2d 797 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (a)(1) does not require a finding of probable cause;
       </b>
       it requires only an “allegation” that the accused is a fugitive from justice. Evans v. State, 820 P.2d 1098 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Judicial determination of probable cause is necessary prerequisite to extradition.
       </b>
       Montague v. Smedley, 557 P.2d 774 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is no probable cause established as before a grand jury, the complaint and supporting papers of the demanding state must establish probable cause before extradition from Alaska will be permitted. Montague v. Smedley, 557 P.2d 774 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 4th amendment forbade Alaska as an asylum state to render up a prisoner absent a showing of probable cause to believe that he had committed a crime in the demanding state. Warmbo v. State, 578 P.2d 582 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Persons subjected to extradition proceedings are protected by certain constitutional rights
       </b>
       which assure that the extradition power is not applied against them in an oppressive or arbitrary manner. Wortham v. State, 519 P.2d 797 (Alaska 1974); Montague v. Smedley, 557 P.2d 774 (Alaska 1976); Warmbo v. State, 578 P.2d 582 (Alaska 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        But probable cause requirements for rendering up alleged parole violator are less stringent
       </b>
       than the requirements for extraditing one who has only been charged with and not convicted of a crime. Wortham v. State, 519 P.2d 797 (Alaska 1974); Montague v. Smedley, 557 P.2d 774 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Extradition proceedings in asylum state must be stayed if defendant is mentally incapable of understanding
       </b>
       the proceedings and aiding his counsel. This follows from the statutory right to the assistance of counsel in extradition proceedings in the asylum state, as well as by analogy to the due process prohibition against trial of a person mentally incapable of understanding or assisting in his defense. Warmbo v. State, 578 P.2d 582 (Alaska 1978).

        Documentation types are independent of each other. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The three types of supporting documentation required by paragraph (a)(2) are independent of each other, each sufficient to support extradition. Evans v. State, 820 P.2d 1098 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement that an affidavit be executed before a magistrate applies only to the third type of supporting documentation. This requirement does not apply to the affidavit supporting an information filed by a public prosecutor. Evans v. State, 820 P.2d 1098 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Affidavit to be made before magistrate.
       </b>
       Both 18 U.S.C. § 3182 and subsection (a)(2) of this section require that the affidavit in support of an extradition arrest must be made before a magistrate. Montague v. Smedley, 557 P.2d 774 (Alaska 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Affidavit made before notary public is thus insufficient
       </b>

        Affidavit supporting information. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a drug case, extradition was sufficiently supported where an affidavit of probable cause was sworn to before a notary public; because the three methods for supporting an extradition request are specified disjunctively in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an affidavit that supports an information does not have to be sworn to before a magistrate. Swarner v. State, 118 P.3d 24 (Alaska Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>

       <b>
        Affidavit not authenticated by governor of demanding state is inadmissible in asylum state. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since both 18 U.S.C. § 3182 and subsection (a)(2) of this section require that the affidavit in support of an extradition arrest must be authenticated by the governor of the demanding state, an affidavit, information or indictment not certified by the executive of the demanding state to the executive of the asylum state as authentic is inadmissible in the asylum state. Montague v. Smedley, 557 P.2d 774 (Alaska 1976).

      <p>
       When the requisition papers include an indictment sufficient on its face, an examination of the accompanying affidavits is not necessary to determine whether the essential elements of a crime have been pleaded. Brown v. State, 518 P.2d 770 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        This section is analogous in this respect to its federal counterpart,
       </b>
       18 U.S.C. § 3182, which has been interpreted as not requiring the presentation of both an affidavit and an indictment to commence interstate rendition proceedings. Brown v. State, 518 P.2d 770 (Alaska 1974).

       Where accompanying the request for extradition to the governor of Alaska were certified documents including two sworn criminal complaints, two informations, a certified commitment to state prison, fingerprint cards and photographs, a certification of the California authorities as to the length of prison term, a certification of parole by the California authorities and a certification of parole revocation by the California authorities together with an agreement of parole signed by appellant, such documents clearly provided sufficient basis for issuance of the Alaska governor’s warrant under subsection (b).

        Presumption created by issuance of warrant. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the governor of the asylum state (in this case, Alaska) issues an extradition warrant, a presumption is created that the accused was present in the demanding state when the alleged crime was committed. The accused can contest extradition by claiming that he was not present in the demanding state at the time of the crime, but a bare assertion of this claim is not enough to defeat extradition. The accused has the burden of establishing this fact. Evans v. State, 820 P.2d 1098 (Alaska Ct. App. 1991).

       Habeas corpus has traditionally been considered as a civil proceeding. But where a possible deprivation of one’s liberty is involved, as it is in an extradition matter, habeas corpus proceedings in relation to extradition will be considered criminal in nature. Kostic v. Smedley, 522 P.2d 535 (Alaska 1974).

        Scope of inquiry is limited. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The courts have traditionally held that in a habeas corpus-extradition matter the scope of inquiry is limited to the issues of (1) whether a crime has been charged in the demanding state, (2) whether the person in custody and seeking habeas corpus is the one charged with such crime, (3) whether such person is a fugitive from justice, and (4) whether the supporting documents from the governor of the demanding state are of proper form and content. Kostic v. Smedley, 522 P.2d 535 (Alaska 1974); Montague v. Smedley, 557 P.2d 774 (Alaska 1976).

        Fugitive must have sufficient mental competency to understand proceedings. —

      </p>
      <p>
       In order to give meaning to the alleged fugitive’s right to bring a habeas corpus action to test the legality of his arrest, and to give meaning to his right to demand and procure legal counsel, it is essential to due process that such person has sufficient mental competency to understand the proceedings and to consult with and assist his counsel in such proceedings. Kostic v. Smedley, 522 P.2d 535 (Alaska 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Extradition proceedings in the asylum state must be stayed if the defendant is mentally incapable of understanding the proceedings and aiding his counsel. This follows from the statutory right to the assistance of counsel in extradition proceedings in the asylum state, as well as by analogy to the due process prohibition against trial of a person mentally incapable of understanding or assisting in his defense. Warmbo v. State, 578 P.2d 582 (Alaska 1978).

       It is no obstacle to extradition that the accused was insane at the time of the commission of the alleged crime in the demanding state, or that he is presently so mentally incompetent as not to be able to assist his counsel in defending against prosecution for that crime.
       These issues are to be determined by the court having jurisdiction of the crime, and not by the courts of the state from which extradition is sought. Kostic v. Smedley, 522 P.2d 535 (Alaska 1974).

       Because petitioner’s application did not claim that the underlying judgment was void, his claim that the superior court suspended the writ of habeas corpus by applying Alaska Civ. R. 86(m) and directing him to refile his complaint as an application for post-conviction relief under Alaska Crim. R. 35.1, was without merit. Hertz v. State, 8 P.3d 1144 (Alaska Ct. App. 2000).

        Newly discovered evidence. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Petitioner's claim of newly discovered evidence failed; he did not address the superior court's findings regarding the testimony, nor did he explain why the court's findings might be erroneous. Considering the superior court's findings regarding the credibility of the witnesses' testimony, and the lack of probative value of another witness's testimony, and the superior court's overall assessment of whether this newly discovered evidence would result in a different verdict, the superior court did not abuse its discretion in denying relief.
       Grossman v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. July 8, 2020) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to set out a prima facie case of newly discovered evidence for post-conviction relief because defendant did not raise a claim of involuntariness due to medical conditions until defendant's motion for reconsideration following the denial of post-conviction relief. Moreover, defendant never contended that the evidence was actually new as defendant made no assertion that the evidence could not have been discovered earlier through the exercise of due diligence and stated that the medical conditions were known prior to trial.
       Hayden v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Apr. 22, 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's post-conviction request for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence was properly denied because a witness's recantations of his testimony made while under duress did not have the same indicia of reliability as his sworn statements during the trial and the deposition; and substantial circumstantial evidence supported the witness's testimony at trial that defendant had participated in the robberies because defendant matched the description of one of the suspects that the robbery victims had given to the police; his car matched the victims' description of a car used by one of the suspects; and, when the police attempted to pull defendant over the day after the robberies, he fled on foot following a high-speed car chase. Geisler v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. July 28, 2021).

       <b>
        Prima facie case. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant established a
       <i>
        prima facie
       </i>
       case that he did not understand the nature of the fourth-degree assault charge when he pled guilty where the court did not take affirmative steps to ensure that he understood the nature of the charge, ask whether he had read the complaint, independently advise him of the elements of the offense, or clarify his statement that his plea was not voluntary. Moreover, in summarizing the factual basis for the plea, the court's description was misleading as it did not clarify that the victim's fear of imminent physical injury had to be reasonable and that defendant must have acted in reckless disregard of this fear.
       Marlin v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. June 3, 2020) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Dismissing a claim that defendant did not understand the fourth-degree assault charge before pleading guilty was not error where the assertions in the police affidavit provided at least a reasonable factual basis that the victim was in fear of imminent physical injury.
       Marlin v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. June 3, 2020) (memorandum decision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Remand was appropriate when defendant’s application for post-conviction relief was dismissed as untimely because the superior court was to address whether defendant pleaded sufficient facts to establish a prima facie claim that defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect that precluded defendant from timely filing defendant’s application for relief. under AS

      </p>
      <p>
       The due process clause of the Alaska Constitution requires a limited exception to the ban on successive petitions for post-conviction relief codified in paragraph (a)(6). Defendants must be allowed to show that, despite their earlier petition for post-conviction relief, they were deprived of a fair opportunity to litigate their claims because they did not receive competent legal representation during the litigation of their first petition. Grinols v. State, 10 P.3d 600 (Alaska Ct. App. 2000), aff'd in part, 74 P.3d 889 (Alaska 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Government’s interest in requiring timely litigation of post-conviction claims, and defendant’s extended opportunity to pursue his claim, outweigh the minimal risk that he suffered a wrongful conviction; defendant did not establish that the statute of limitations violated his right to due process of law. Xavier v. State, 278 P.3d 902 (Alaska Ct. App. 2012).

        Due process requirements in consideration of post-conviction DNA evidentiary claims. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Due process clause of the Alaska Constitution may require some avenue of relief where a constitutional violation could have resulted in the conviction of one who is innocent. Even though defendant’s claim of innocence is apparently barred by subsection (b)(2), it can be argued that the due process clause requires disregard of the wording of the statute and allows defendant to pursue his claim, as long as there is some chance that he could prove himself innocent by clear and convincing evidence. Osborne v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Feb. 11, 2005), op. withdrawn, superseded, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. 2005), sub. op., 110 P.3d 986 (Alaska Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant who seeks post-conviction DNA testing must, at a minimum, meet the three-part test endorsed by the state courts; that is, the defendant must show that the conviction rested primarily on eyewitness identification evidence, that there was a demonstrable doubt concerning the defendant’s identification as the perpetrator, and that scientific testing would likely be conclusive on the issue. Osborne v. State, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. Feb. 11, 2005), op. withdrawn, superseded, — P.3d — (Alaska Ct. App. 2005), sub. op., 110 P.3d 986 (Alaska Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       When an indigent defendant’s first petition for post-conviction relief is challenged as time-barred under this section, defendant has a constitutional right to the assistance of counsel when responding to that challenge. Holden v. State, 172 P.3d 815 (Alaska Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals erroneously applied pre-conviction standards in finding that a state inmate had a due process right to access to evidence the state used to obtain a conviction for kidnapping, assault, and sexual assault. The issue of post-conviction access to DNA evidence is best left to Congress and state legislatures, and there was nothing inadequate about the procedures Alaska provided to the inmate. DA's Office v. Osborne, 557 U.S. 52, 129 S. Ct. 2308, 174 L. Ed. 2d 38 (U.S. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Parolee’s claim that post-conviction relief counsel was ineffective did not bar application of res judicata in his action seeking an order lifting the conditions on his parole because any argument regarding ineffective assistance of counsel should have been brought in a subsequent post-conviction relief proceeding; allowing the parolee to bring his claim as part of a separate civil suit would allow him to circumvent the protections the State received under the post-conviction relief statutes.

       Defendants bore the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence that they were entitled to withdraw their no contest pleas to assault; nevertheless, the trial court’s findings that defendants understood the collateral consequences of their pleas were not clearly erroneous, and the finding that the possibility that they could be sued in a civil suit did not affect their decision to plead was also not clearly erroneous.

       Denial of defendant's application for post-conviction DNA testing of blood and semen samples found at the scene of a double murder was appropriate because, given the strength of the State of Alaska's evidence in defendant's trial, defendant failed to show that the proposed DNA testing, if favorable, would have raised a reasonable probability that the outcome of trial would have been different — specifically a reasonable chance that reasonable doubt regarding defendant's guilt would have been found when none had previously existed.
